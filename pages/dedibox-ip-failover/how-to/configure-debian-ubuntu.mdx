This guide provides step-by-step instructions for configuring a Dedibox [failover IP](/dedibox-ip-failover/concepts/#failover-ips) on Debian and Ubuntu Linux. A failover IP is a secondary IP address that can be assigned to your server.


<Requirements />

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- [Created](/dedibox/how-to/order-a-server/) a Dedibox dedicated server


## Failover IP configuration on Debian

1. Connect to your server using SSH and open the network configuration file `/etc/network/interfaces` in a text editor, such as `nano`:
    ```bash
    nano /etc/network/interfaces
    ```
2. Add the failover IP to the configuration as shown in the following example:
    ```bash
    # This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
    # and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).
    # The loopback network interface
    auto lo
    iface lo inet loopback
    # The primary network interface
    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet static
        address 195.154.123.123
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        gateway 195.154.123.1
    auto eth0:0
    iface eth0:0 inet static
        address ip_failover
        netmask 255.255.255.255
    ```
    <Message type="note">
      The interface name (`eth0` in this example) may vary depending on your OS version and system configuration. Use the `ifconfig` command to determine the name of your primary network interface.
    </Message>

3. Save the file and exit the editor. Bring up the interface using the following command:
    ```bash
    ifup eth0:0
    ```

## Failover IP configuration on Ubuntu (Netplan)

Since Ubuntu 18.04, Netplan has been the default network configuration system.

1. Disable cloud-init network configuration to prevent conflicts with Netplan:
    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d
    echo 'network: {config: disabled}' | sudo tee /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg
    ```
    <Message type="important">
      This step is necessary to prevent cloud-init from overriding the Netplan configuration.
    </Message>

2. Backup the existing Netplan configuration and create a new file:
    ```bash
    sudo cp /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml /etc/netplan/01-myplan.yaml
    sudo mv /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml-backup
    ```
4. Edit the new Netplan configuration file `/etc/netplan/01-myplan.yaml` using `nano`:
    ```yml
    network:
      renderer: networkd
      ethernets:
        enp5s0:
          critical: true
          dhcp-identifier: mac
          dhcp4: false
          dhcp6: false
          addresses:
            - 51.111.222.333/24  # Server main IP (/24)
            - 212.111.222.333/32  # Alternate IPs / IP redirects (/32)
            - 212.111.222.334/32
            - 212.111.222.335/32
          routes:
            - to: 0.0.0.0/0
              via: 62.210.0.1
              metric: 1
              on-link: true
          nameservers:
            addresses:
              - 51.159.69.156
              - 51.159.69.162
        enp6s0:
          dhcp4: true
          dhcp4-overrides:
            use-routes: false
          routes:
            - to: 10.88.0.0/13  # Use appropriate IP/gateway from DHCP
              via: 10.89.23.129
    version: 2
    ```
    <Message type="tip">
      Ensure that indentation and formatting are correct to avoid YAML syntax errors.
    </Message>

5. Run the following command to test the configuration:
    ```bash
    sudo netplan try
    ```
6. If everything works as expected, apply the configuration:
    ```bash
    sudo netplan apply
    ```
    <Message type="important">
      If there is an error in your configuration, it might render your network inaccessible. You may need to revert changes using [KVM/IPMI](/dedibox-kvm-over-ip/quickstart/) access.
    </Message>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your network configuration, check the logs using:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u systemd-networkd --no-pager
```
You can also refer to the [official Canonical repository](https://github.com/canonical/netplan/tree/main/examples) for more Netplan examples and troubleshooting guides.
