## Problem

I am experiencing issues while deleting objects

## Cause

object is locked
bucket is versioned 

## Possible solutions

object is locked
-> check object lock via a HeadObject, if it’s Governance, you can bypass it with a delete object with the header “x-amz-bypass-governance-retention”, also specify the VersionId since a bucket with lock enabled is versioned.

bucket is versioned
A DeleteObject on a versioned bucket with no VersionId specified will create a delete marker and the objects will still exist. To actually delete it, list all the versions with a ListObjectVersions (you can specify the name of your object as prefix) and then send a DeleteObject on each versions. 

## Going further

- Refer to the [bucket policies overview](/object-storage/api-cli/bucket-policy/) for more information on the different elements of a bucket policy.

- If you did not manage to identify the error and solve it by yourself, [open a support ticket](/account/how-to/open-a-support-ticket/), and provide as many details as possible, along with the necessary information below:
    - Object Storage Endpoint (e.g. `s3.fr-par.scw.cloud`)
    - Bucket name
    - Object name (if the request concerns an object)
    - Request type (PUT, GET, etc.)
    - HTTP status code
    - Date and time (timestamp)
    - User-agent (SDK, client, console, etc.)
    - Transaction ID (if possible)
    - Log / trace of the error (if possible)
