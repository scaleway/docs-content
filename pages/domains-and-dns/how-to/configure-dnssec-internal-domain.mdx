DNSSEC uses digital signatures based on public key cryptography to strengthen DNS authentication. You can enable or disable DNSSEC for each of your internal domain names.

This page shows you how to enable DNSSEC for your Domains and DNS internal domains only. You can also [enable DNSSEC using the API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/domains-and-dns/registrar-api/#path-domains-update-domain-dnssec).

<Requirements />

- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An internal domain name managed with [Scaleway Domains and DNS](https://www.scaleway.com/en/domains-and-dns/)
