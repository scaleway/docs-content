## Cloud-init

Cloud-init is a multi-distribution package that [provides boot time customization for cloud servers](/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes/#how-to-use-cloud-init). It enables an automatic Instance configuration as it boots into the cloud, turning a generic Ubuntu image into a configured server in a few seconds.

## Development Instance

[Development Instances](/instances/reference-content/development/) are reliable and flexible Instances tuned to host your websites, applications, and development environments. Refer to the [Choosing the best Scaleway Instance type for your workload](/instances/reference-content/choosing-instance-type/) documentation page for more information.


## Dynamic IP

A dynamic IP is an alternative type of public IP address for your Instance. This type of IP address is detached and released back into the general public pool of IP addresses whenever you stop your Instance. This means when you next power on your Instance, it may get a different dynamic IP address. In this respect, dynamic IPs are different from [flexible IPs](#flexible-ip), which remain associated with your Instance even when the Instance is stopped and are held in your account and can be moved between different Instances if you wish.

You can choose to give your Instance a dynamic IP address when creating or updating your Instance via the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/) only. Read our [billing FAQ](/billing/faq/#when-does-the-billing-of-an-instance-start-and-stop) for more information about the billing of dynamic and flexible IPs.

## Flexible IP

Flexible IP addresses are public IP addresses that you can hold independently of any Instance. When you create a Scaleway Instance, by default, its public IP address is also a flexible IP address. Flexible IP addresses can be attached to and detached from any Instances you wish. You can keep a number of flexible IP addresses in your account at any given time. When you delete a flexible IP address, it is disassociated from your account to be used by other users. Find out more with our dedicated documentation on [how to use flexible IP addresses](/instances/how-to/use-flexips/). See also [Dynamic IPs](#dynamic-ip).

## General Purpose Instances

[General Purpose Instances](/instances/reference-content/general-purpose/) are production-grade [Instances](#instance) designed for scalable infrastructures. Development Instances support the boot-on-block feature and allow you to launch high-performance services with high-end CPUs. Refer to the [Choosing the best Scaleway Instance type for your workload](/instances/reference-content/choosing-instance-type/) documentation page for more information.

## GPU Instance

[GPU Instances](/gpu/reference-content/choosing-gpu-instance-type/) are powerful Instances equipped with dedicated high-end Nvidia graphics processing units. See our [dedicated GPU documentation](/gpu/) for more details.

## Image

An image is a complete backup of your Instance. One image contains all the [volumes](#volumes) of your Instance and can be used to restore your Instance and its data. You can also use it to create a series of Instances with a predefined configuration. If you wish to copy only a specific volume of an Instance, you can use the [snapshot](#snapshot) feature instead.

## Instance

An Instance is a virtual computing unit that offers resources for running applications. It functions as a self-contained entity with its own operating system, RAM, and storage. Each type of Instance has unique specifications. You can choose the type that best meets your requirements. Refer to our [Instance types documentation](/instances/reference-content/choosing-instance-type/) for further details on the various Scaleway Instance options.

## InstantApp

An InstantApp is an image with a preinstalled application. By choosing an InstantApp when prompted to select an image during the [creation of your Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/), you choose to install the specified application on your Instance. You can then start using the application immediately.

## Local volumes

<LocalVolumes />

## Placement groups

Placement groups allow you to run multiple Compute Instances, each on a different physical hypervisor. Placement groups have two operating modes. The first one is called `max_availability`. It ensures that all the Compute Instances that belong to the same cluster will not run on the same underlying hardware. The second one is called `low_latency` and does the opposite, bringing Compute Instances closer together to achieve higher network throughput. [Learn how to use placement groups](/instances/how-to/use-placement-groups/).

## Power-off mode

The Power-off mode [shuts down an Instance](/instances/how-to/power-off-instance/) by transferring all data on the local volume of the Instance to a volume store. The physical node is released back to the pool of available machines. The reserved flexible IP of the Instance remains available in the account.

## Private Networks

Private Networks allow your virtual Instances to communicate in an isolated and secure network without requiring a connection to the public internet. Each Instance can be [connected to one or several Private Networks](/instances/how-to/use-private-networks/), letting you build your own network topologies.

Private Networks are LAN-like layer 2 Ethernet networks. A new network interface with a unique media access control address (MAC address) is configured on each Instance in a Private Network. Use this interface to communicate in a secure and isolated network, using private IP addresses of your choice.

## Protected Instance

Protected Instance is a feature that prevents any halt action from being performed on your Instance. This only applies to running Instances. [Enabling the Protected Instance feature](/instances/how-to/use-protected-instance/) means that you will not be able to delete, power off, or reboot your Instance, nor put it into standby mode.

## Public IP

Public IP addresses are routed on the internet. You can enter the public IP address of your Instance into any browser connected to the internet, and access content being served from that Instance. You can think of public IP addresses like postal addresses for buildings - they are unique and tell the routers directing traffic through the internet where to find a particular server.

## Region

<Region />

## Rescue mode

Rescue mode restarts your server via the network on a minimal operating system. You can [use rescue mode](/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes/#how-to-use-rescue-mode) to debug your server and recover your system data. Rescue mode creates a ramdisk with the content of a downloaded rootfs. You will have access to all your disks and will be able to perform debug and rescue actions. After disabling rescue mode, you will have to reboot your server. Your server needs to be running to switch to rescue mode.

## Reverse DNS

Reverse DNS is the opposite of classic "forward" DNS, and maps an IP address to a hostname. This can be useful if, for example, you want to send emails from your Instance. Find out how to [configure reverse DNS on your Instance](/instances/how-to/configure-reverse-dns/) with our how-to documentation.

## Routed flexible IP

A routed flexible IP means assigning a public IP address to an Instance (virtual machine) that is reachable directly from the internet. This means there is no address translation, and the Instance uses the public IP as its identity on the internet.
The Instance can be accessed or can communicate directly using this public IP, which helps to make network configuration straightforward, with unrestricted inbound and outbound connections, crucial for services like web hosting or email servers.

## Security group

Security groups allow you to [create rules to drop or allow public traffic coming to and from your Instances](/instances/how-to/use-security-groups/). You can set default policies for inbound and outbound traffic, and/or define rules to deal with traffic differently depending on its source. Security groups can be [stateful](#stateful-security-groups) or [stateless](#stateless-security-groups). Note that security groups for Elastic Metal servers cannot be stateful.
<Message type="note">
  Security Groups only allow the filtering of **public** traffic to and from your Instances. To filter traffic within a Private Network, you can [configure a firewall](/tutorials/installation-uncomplicated-firewall/) directly on your Instance, or use `iptables` or `nftables` from the command line interface of your Instance.

## Snapshot

<BlockSnapshot />

## Snapshot type

An image is composed of snapshots of volumes. Snapshots can only be restored to a volume of the original type.

## Standby mode

Standby mode is a way to stop an Instance temporarily. When you [put an Instance in standby mode](/instances/how-to/use-standby-mode/), the server is halted, but the Instance remains allocated to your account, and all data remains on the Local Storage of the Instance.

## Stateful security groups

Stateful security groups disregard the default policy and inbound/outbound rules if a connection is initiated from your Instance. Traffic will always be permitted on connections that you initiated. This is useful for example if you want to initiate connections on many and various ports for messaging, video streaming, or other purposes. In this case, the traffic from/to that connection will not be blocked, even if you have defined a rule that would otherwise do so. [Learn how to use security groups](/instances/how-to/use-security-groups/).

## Stateless security groups

Stateless security groups strictly apply the default policy and inbound/outbound rules, regardless of whether a connection is initiated from your Instance or not. This is useful if you know exactly which ports you will always require for your Instance, e.g. port `22` for SSH. You can make your security group stateless, define a rule to allow traffic on port `22` and block incoming traffic on other ports regardless of whether a connection is initiated from your Instance on this port. [Learn how to use security groups](/instances/how-to/use-security-groups/).

## Tags

Tags allow you to organize, sort, filter, and monitor your cloud resources using any pattern you wish. You can assign as many tags as you want to each Scaleway product.
