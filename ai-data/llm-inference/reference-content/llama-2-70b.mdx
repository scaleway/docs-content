### Sending Inference requests

To perform inference tasks with your LLM model deployed on the Triton Inference Server, follow these steps:

```bash
curl -k --request POST \
  --url https://<Service UUID>.ifr.fr-par.scw.cloud/v2/models/ensemble/generate \
  -H "x-auth-token: <IAM token>" \
  --data '{
  "text_input": "Today is a nice day.",
  "max_tokens": 200,
```

<Message type="note">
  Ensure that the input data is properly formatted according to the model's input requirements.
</Message>

### Receiving Inference responses

Upon sending the HTTP request to the public or private endpoints exposed by the server, you will receive inference responses from the Triton server. 
Process the output data according to your application's needs. The response will contain the output generated by the LLM model based on the input provided in the request.
