## How to resync a Read Replica

When you resync a Read Replica, first it is reset, and then its data is resynchronized from the primary node. Your Read Replica will be unavailable during resynchronization. The process duration is proportional to the size of your Database Instance. The configured endpoints will not change.

1. Click **Document Databases** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Scroll down to the **Read Replica** section.
4. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Resync** next to the name of the Read Replica you want to resync. A pop-up displays.
5. Make sure you have selected the correct Read Replica and click **Resync**. The list of your Read Replicas displays.

    <Message type="important">
      Your private IP addresses are automatically allocated. They are managed via an IP Address Manager (IPAM). You can retrieve them on the Private Network tab of your Database Instance. To allocate IPs manually, you can use the Scaleway API and CLI, or Terraform.
