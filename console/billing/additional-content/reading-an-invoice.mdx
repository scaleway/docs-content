Your Scaleway invoice contains the following sections:

- **Invoice number (1):** A unique reference number for your invoice.
- **Invoice status (2):** Displays the billing period, issuing and due dates of the invoice.
- **Seller information (3):** Contact details of Scaleway SAS along with their VAT number.
- **Customer details (4):** Includes postal address, email address, Organization ID, and for business accounts, the EU VAT number.
- **Project table (5):** Provides information on invoiced projects, including project names, consumed resources, and total project amounts based on consumption during the accounting period. 
  Located below the project table you find the **Consumption table**. This section details resource consumption, including project names, services/operations consumed (e.g., Instances, Object Storage, Elastic Metal servers), consumption periods, total usage, and calculated prices based on consumption.
- **Total invoice amount (6):** Calculated from the untaxed total of the invoice. For EU customers, the local VAT rate is applied to the untaxed total to determine the total due amount.
