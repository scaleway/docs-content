## OpenAI client libraries

Scaleway Generative APIs follow OpenAI's API structure, making integration straightforward. To get started, you'll need to install the OpenAI library and set up your API key.

### Configuration

To use the OpenAI client library with Scaleway's Generative APIs, first install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install openai
```

Then set the API key and base URL in your OpenAI-compatible client:
```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.scaleway.ai/v1",
    api_key="<API secret key>"
)
```
<Message type="tip">
  Make sure to replace `<API secret key>` with your actual API key.
</Message>

### Using OpenAI client for text generation

To use OpenAI client for text generation, you can create a `client.chat.completions` object and call the `create` method:
```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke about AI"}]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## LangChain (RAG & LLM applications)

LangChain is a popular library for building AI applications. Scaleway's Generative APIs support LangChain for both inference and embeddings.

### Python
<Message type="tip">
  Refer to our dedicated documentation for [implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain and Scaleway Generative APIs](/tutorials/how-to-implement-rag-generativeapis/)
</Message>

## LlamaIndex (advanced RAG applications)

LlamaIndex is an open-source framework for building Large Language Models (LLMs) based applications, especially optimizing RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipelines. 
1. Install the required dependencies to use the LlamaIndex framework with Scaleway's Generative APIs:
    ```bash
    pip install llama-index-llms-openai-like
    ```

2. Create a file `main.py` and add the following code to it to configure the `OpenAILike` client and your secret key:
    ```python
    from llama_index.llms.openai_like import OpenAILike
    from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage

    llm = OpenAILike(
      model="llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
      api_key="<API secret key>",
      api_base="https://api.scaleway.ai/v1",
      max_tokens=512,
      temperature=0.7,
      top_p=1,
      presence_penalty=0,
    )
    ```
    <Message type="tip">
        Make sure to replace `<API secret key>` with your actual API key.
    </Message>

3. You can then interact with the LLM by sending messages to the model with the following code:
    ```python
    response = llm.chat([ChatMessage("Could you tell me about Scaleway please ?")])
    print(response)
    ```

4. Finally, run `main.py`:
    ```python
    python main.py
    ```
    The LLM response should display an answer:
    ```bash
    Generally, Scaleway is a reliable and secure cloud provider that offers a range of services for businesses and developers.
    ```

### Javascript (Typescript)

To perform chat conversations with Langchain, first install `langchain` and `@langchain/openai` packages using your node package manager.

1. Use the following command to install Langchain using `npm` (`yarn` and `pnpm` are also available):
    ```bash
    npm install langchain @langchain/openai
    ```

2. Edit your `package.json` file to ensure it has the `"type": "module"` property:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "module",
      "dependencies": {
        "@langchain/openai": "^0.4.4",
        "langchain": "^0.3.19"
      }
    }
    ```

3. Create a `main.js` file and add the following content to it:
    ```js
    import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

    const chat = new ChatOpenAI({
        apiKey: "<API secret key>",
        model: "llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
        configuration: {
            baseURL: "https://api.scaleway.ai/v1",
        }
      });

    const response = await chat.invoke("Tell me a joke");
    console.log(response.content);
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      Make sure to replace `<API secret key>` with your actual API secret key.
    </Message>

4. Run `main.js`:
    ```bash
    node main.js
    ```
    The model answer should display:
    ```bash
    Why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself? Because it was two-tired.
    ```

Note that other Langchain objects from OpenAI client library are also compatible, such as `OpenAI` and `OpenAIEmbeddings`.

## Bolt.diy (code generation)

Bolt.diy is a software enabling users to create web applications from the prompt. 

1. Install and launch Bolt.diy locally. Follow the setup instructions provided in the [Bolt.diy GitHub repository](https://github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy?tab=readme-ov-file#setup).
2. Once Bolt.diy is running, open the interface in your web browser.
3. Click the icon next to the Bolt logo to display the sidebar.
4. Click the cogwheel icon in the sidebar's bottom left corner to open the **Settings**.
5. Click **Local Providers** to add a new external provider configuration.
6. Toggle the switch next to **OpenAILike** to enable it. Then, enter the Scaleway API endpoint: `https://api.scaleway.ai/v1` as the base URL.
7. In Bolt's main menu, select `OpenAILike` and input your **Scaleway Secret Key** as the `OpenAILike API Key`.
8. Select one of the supported models from Scaleway Generative APIs. For best results with Bolt.diy, which requires a significant amount of output tokens (8000 by default), start with the `llama-3.1-8b-instruct` model.
9. Enter your prompt in the Bolt.diy interface to see your application being generated.

Alternatively, you can also setup your Scaleway Secret Key by renaming `.env.example` to `.env`, adding corresponding environment variables values and restarting Bolt.diy:
```bash
OPENAI_LIKE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.scaleway.ai/v1
OPENAI_LIKE_API_KEY=###SCW_SECRET_KEY###
```

To enable configuration from `.env` is taken into account, you still need to enable **OpenAILike** from Bolt interface in **Settings > Local Providers** section.
<Message type="note"
  If you first configured your credentials through the browser, you also need to reset your browser's cookies for your localhost domain (as Bolt.diy stores model provider configuration information in the browser).
</Message>

<Message type="tip">
  If you want to limit access to a specific Scaleway Project, replace API endpoint with `https://api.scaleway.ai/###PROJECT_ID###/v1/` since the default URL `https://api.scaleway.ai/v1/` can only be used with the default project.
