An **I**ntelligent **P**latform **M**anagement **I**nterface (IPMI) is an industry standard to describe the subsystem of a server providing remote management and monitoring capabilities. IPMI allows you to manage and monitor a server even if it is powered off or unresponsive, by using a network connection to the hardware. IPMI is made possible by the **B**aseboard **M**anagement **C**ontroller, a totally independent piece of hardware connected to your network card, composed of an I2C bus and a dedicated processor.

Some examples of features that can be remotely monitored via the IPMI include:

  - Ventilation
  - Temperature
  - Voltage
  - Operating time

Actions that can be carried out via IPMI include:

  - Rebooting via KVM 
  - Switching server off and/or on
  - Configuration of automatic notification in case of hardware problems (power supply failure, temperature anomalies, etc.)
  - Viewing of logs from the BIOS
  - Accessing the serial port and BIOS over the network via serial console.

In this document, we show you how to access the IPMI for a Dell or HP server. See the [KVM-over-IP](/dedibox/kvm-over-ip/) documentation for information about other server models.

## How to use IPMI via Dell iDRAC

IPMI is a standard specification for a remote management subsystem. On a Dell server, IPMI is realized through the iDRAC: the **i**ntegrated **D**ell **R**emote **A**ccess **C**ontroller.

1. From the console, click **Server** > **Server list**. A list of your servers displays.

2. Click **Manage** next to the relevant server.

3. Click the **IDRAC** button on the right. A disclaimer displays.

4. Click **I Accept** to agree with the terms of the disclaimer.

5. Enter the authorized IPv4 address for the iDRAC connection. The IP address of your Internet connection is already pre-filled in the form. Then click **Create** to generate your credentials.

    <Message type="note">

    Currently only IPv4 addresses are accepted.

6. Use the interface to monitor and manage your server's hardware:
  - The **System** tabs let you view various system information including system details, logs and power status. You can also use the **Console/Media** > **Virtual Media** tab to install your server remotely with a custom OS by connecting virtual media. Click **Remote Access Controller** under **System Details** to launch the KVM.
  - The **iDDRAC** tabs show you information about the iDRAC itself.
  - Click the other relevant links on the left sidebar to see information about **Batteries**, **Temperatures**, **Voltages**, etc. as required.

## How to use IPMI via HP iLO

IPMI is a standard specification for a remote management subsystem. On a Dell server, IPMI is realized through the ILO: the **i**ntegrated **L**ights **O**ut processor.

1. From the console, click **Server** > **Server list**. A list of your servers displays.

2. Click **Manage** next to the relevant server.

3. Click the **IDRAC** button on the right. A disclaimer displays.

4. Click **I Accept** to agree with the terms of the disclaimer.

5. Enter the authorized IPv4 address for the iDRAC connection. The IP address of your Internet connection is already pre-filled in the form. Then click **Create** to generate your credentials.

    <Message type="note">

    Currently only IPv4 addresses are accepted.

    </Message>

  The URL connection and your credentials display. Click on the link to access the iLO interface.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-ilo.png" alt="" />

6. Use the interface to monitor and manage your server's hardware:
  - The **Information** pages let you view various system information including system details, logs and diagnostics.
  - The **Remote Console** pages let you launch the KVM.
  - The **Virtual Media** pages let you install your server remotely with a custom OS by connecting virtual media.
  - Click the other relevant links on the left sidebar to see more information.
