This page explains how to upload your functions and their dependencies as a zip file using the Scaleway console.

This feature allows you to add your libraries or static files to your function.

## How to package a function into zip file

There are [different methods to deploy functions](/serverless/functions/reference-content/deploy-function/) and some of them require the function to be packaged into a `zip` file.

To match the Scaleway build pipelines requirements, functions zip files must contain the content of the root folder you want to publish.

### How to create a zip file 

Use the `zip` command to create an archive of your function and its dependencies:

```sh
zip -r myFunction.zip myFunction/
```

The example above will create a `.zip` archive that contains the myFunction folder and its content. You can then upload this archive to your Serverless Functions.


### How to upload your zip file

<Tabs id="tab1">
  <TabsTab label="Scaleway Console">

    1. Package your dependencies on your local computer, as explained in the [Configure your package](/serverless/functions/how-to/package-function-dependencies-in-zip/#how-to-zip-your-function) section.
    2. Create a **ZIP** archive containing the files and folders you need.
    3. Go to the [Functions](https://console.scaleway.com/functions/namespaces/) section of the Scaleway console and click on the functions namespace you want to configure.
    4. Click **+ Create function**. The function creation page displays.
    5. On the function creation page, choose your desired runtime.
    6. Select **Upload a ZIP** under **Function code**.
    7. Drag and drop your zip file in the reserved field or upload it.
    8. Specify your **handler** path.
    9. Configure your function.
    10. Click **Create function** to finish.

  <TabsTab label="Scaleway API">

    1. In a terminal, set an environment variable to name the zip file automatically:
        ```bash
        export FUNCTION_ARCHIVE="function-$SCW_FUNCTION_ID.zip"
        ```

    2. Create a zip archive with your code:
        ```bash
        zip $FUNCTION_ARCHIVE handler.js
        ```

        <Message type="note">
          If you wish to use external dependencies, you will have to package them inside the zip archive as well:

            ```bash
            zip -r $FUNCTION_ARCHIVE package.json handler.js node_modules
            ```
        </Message>
    
    3. Run `ls -lh` to get the size of your archive in bytes:
        ```sh
        ls -lh
        -rw-r--r--  1 user  group 675 Apr 18 15:42 
        ```

    4. Export the archive size in bytes as an environment variable:

        ```bash
        export ARCHIVE_SIZE=675
        ```

    5. Get the presigned URL from the API.
        ```
        export PRESIGNED_URL=$(curl -X GET -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
        "https://api.scaleway.com/functions/v1beta1/regions/$SCW_DEFAULT_REGION/functions/$SCW_FUNCTION_ID/upload-url?content_length=$ARCHIVE_SIZE" | jq ."url")
        ```
    6. Run the following command to check that the presigned URL has been properly exported:

        ```sh
        echo $PRESIGNED_URL
        ```

        A response like the following displays:
        ```json
        "https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/scw-database-srvless-prod/uploads/

        <Message type="important">
          Make sure the URL is contained in double quotes (`"`), and that it does not contain raw Javascript character codes (such as `\u0026` instead of `&`). 
        </Message>

    7. Run the following code to upload your code to the presigned URL:
        ```bash
        curl -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" --upload-file $FUNCTION_ARCHIVE \
        -H "Content-Length: $ARCHIVE_SIZE" $PRESIGNED_URL

## How to configure your package

### Handler

<Tabs id="tab1">
  <TabsTab label="Python">
    The Handler name is a path to the handler file, suffixed with the function name to use as a handler. In the following example, we use one handler, `hello.py`, inside the `src/handlers` folder.

    ```
    .
    └── handlers
        └── hello.py → def say_hello(event, context): ...
    ```

    1. Package your function. On Unix systems, you can use the `zip` utility:

        ```
        zip -r functions.zip handlers/
        ```

    2. Upload the archive in the console.
    3. Provide a custom handler name. Here, the handler is `handlers/hello.say_hello`.
        <Message type="note">
          By default, the handler path is `handler.handle` (def handle in handler.py). Refer to the [Functions handlers reference](/serverless/functions/reference-content/functions-handlers/) for more information.
        </Message>
  </TabsTab>
  <TabsTab label="Node">
      The Handler name is a path to the handler file, suffixed with the function name to use as a handler. In the following example, we use two handlers, `hello.js` and `world.js`, inside the `handlers` folder.

    ```
    .
    └── handlers
        └── hello.js → export {sayHello}; function sayHello(...) {} 
    ```

    1. Package your function. On Unix systems, you can use the `zip` utility:

        ```console
        zip -r functions.zip handlers/
        ```

    2. Upload the archive in the console.
    3. Provide a custom handler name. In this case, the handler is `handlers/hello.sayHello`.
  </TabsTab>
  <TabsTab label="Golang">
    With **Golang** functions, the handler name should be the name of your exported handler function if your handler is at the root of your folder.
    If your handler is in a subdirectory, the handler name should be prefixed by the directory followed by the exported function name.

    ```
    .
    ├── go.mod
    ├── go.sum
    └── handler.go → package handler with func Handle()

    ```

    1. Package your function. On Unix systems, you can use the `zip` utility:

        ```
        zip -r functions.zip go.mod go.sum handler.go
        ```

    2. Upload the archive in the console.
    3. Provide a custom handler name. Each of your functions will know which handler file to run:
        - For the file `handler.go` at the root of the project → `Handle`.

      <Message type="note">
        By default, the handler path is `Handle` (package main at the root of the archive).
      </Message>
  </TabsTab>
  <TabsTab label="PHP">
    The Handler name is a path to the handler file, suffixed with the function name to use as a handler. In the following example, we use the handler file `handler.php`.

    ```
    .
    ├── composer.json → optional
    └── handler.php → handler function defined here
    ```

    The `composer.json` file enables you to define dependencies that will be installed when deploying your functions, for more information, you can check the [official documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md/#package-links/) of composer.

    1. Package your functions. On Unix systems, you can use the `zip` utility:

        ```
        zip -r function.zip composer.json handler.php
        ```

    2. Upload the archive in the console.
    3. Make sure to provide the right handler name, with the previous directory structure: `handler.handle`.
  </TabsTab>
  <TabsTab label="Rust">
    The Handler name is a path to the handler file, suffixed with the function name to use as a handler. In the following example, we use the handler file `handler.rs` inside the `src` folder.

    ``` 
    .
    ├── Cargo.lock
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── src
        └── handler.rs → pub async fn handle(...)
    ```

    1. Specify the file to be executed in your `Cargo.toml` file:

        ```
          [lib]
          path = "src/handler.rs"
        ```

    2. Make sure to provide the right handler name, namely `handle`.
  </TabsTab>
</Tabs>

### Dependencies

<Tabs id="tab1">
  <TabsTab label="Python">
    Additional dependencies must be included inside a `package` directory at the root of your archive.

    Your directory structure should look like this:

    ```
    .
    ├── handlers
    │   ├── handler.py
    │   └── second_handler.py
    └── package → Your vendored Python dependencies
        └── requests
    ```

    To package your functions into an archive that can be uploaded to the console, you can use the `zip` utility:

    ```sh
    zip -r functions.zip handlers/ package/
    ```

    #### Python standard dependencies

    In addition, you can install your dependencies in the package directory. To do so, run the following command:

    ```
    pip install requests --target ./package
    ```

    Or with a `requirements.txt` file:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt --target ./package
    ```

    #### Specific libraries (with needs for specific C compiled code)

    In some specific cases, you might need to install libraries that require specific `C` compiled code such as:

    - numpy
    - tensorflow
    - pandas
    - scikit-learn
    - psycopg2
    and others.

    Our Python runtimes run on top of [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) environments, for these specific dependencies, you will have to install your dependencies inside a **Docker container**, with a specific image, that we are providing to our users.
    Run the following command from the root of your project to install your dependencies before uploading your source code and deploying your function:

    ```
    PYTHON_VERSION=3.10 # or 3.7, 3.8, ...
    docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home/app/function --workdir /home/app/function rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/scwfunctionsruntimes-public/python-dep:$PYTHON_VERSION pip install -r requirements.txt --target ./package
    ```

    This command will run `pip install` with the given `requirements.txt` file inside a docker container compatible with our function runtimes, and pull the installed dependencies locally to your package directory. As these dependencies have been installed on top of Alpine Linux with our compatible system libraries, you will be able to upload your source code and deploy your function properly.

  </TabsTab>
  <TabsTab label="Node">
      If you need to push external dependencies for your `node.js` functions, you must package your `node_modules` directory into your deployment archive. To do so, launch the following command:

    ```
    .
    ├── handler.js
    └── node_modules
        └── your_dependencies
    ```

    You can use tools such as [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [NCC](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vercel/ncc/) a CLI tool to build `node.js executables`, which packages your code into separate files. Then, you will be able to upload your compiled handler file reducing the size of your bundle.
      For example:
      ```ncc handler.js -o build/handler.js # -> Builds dist/inde```.

    Then, set up your function handler to be: `build/handler.js` if you package the whole build directory. Do not forget to point the function handler property to the path of your built handler in your archive (if `build/handler.myHandler`, then `handler` must be `build/handler.js`).
  </TabsTab>
  <TabsTab label="Golang">
    If you need **external dependencies** for your Golang handlers, you can provide these dependencies using Go Modules.
    Our runtimes automatically install your dependencies at **Build time** (once you start the function deployment).

    <Message type="note">
      Dependencies installation at the build-time results in longer builds.

    ```
    .
    ├── go.mod
    ├── go.sum
    └── handler.go
    ```

    Package your dependencies with the command `go mod vendor`, and provide your generated vendor directory to the function archive. This approach will save you some time during builds:

    ```
    .
    ├── go.mod
    ├── go.sum
    ├── main.go
    └── vendor
        └── your-dependencies
    ```

## How to manage multiple handles in the same zip file

To enhance deployment simplicity, all runtimes support the inclusion of multiple handlers, either within a single file or across multiple files.

Example:

```
.
├── myFuncA.lang (contains handlerA() and handlerB())
└── myFuncB.lang (contains handlerC())
```

Like that, you can create 3 functions with the same zip file simply by changing the [handler](/serverless/functions/concepts/#handler) parameter to match the handler you want:
- `myFuncA.handlerA`
- `myFuncA.handlerB`
- `myFuncB.handlerC`

You can also create a single Serverless Function with several handlers in the same zip file, and change the [handler](/serverless/functions/concepts/#handler) parameter according to your needs.
