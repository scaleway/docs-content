## Vuls - Overview

[Vuls](https://vuls.io/) is an open-source vulnerability scanner written in [Go](https://www.scaleway.com/docs/installation-golang-on-ubuntu/). It automates security vulnerability checks on the software installed on a system, which can be a demanding task in a system administrators daily life. Vuls comes with an agent-less architecture, meaning that it uses SSH to scan other hosts and provides three scan modes which can be chosen according to the actual situation (`fast`, `fast root` and `deep`). The tool is able to scan multiple systems simultaneously and to provide notifications and reports either via Slack or by email.

## Installing the dependencies and pre-work

1. Connect to the server as `root` via [SSH](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).
2. Update the APT package cache and the software already installed on the Instance:
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
3. Install required dependencies, including Go via APT:
    ```
    apt install sqlite git debian-goodies gcc make wget golang-go -y
    ```
4. Create a directory `vuls` which will contain all data Vuls uses:
    ```
    mkdir -p /usr/share/vuls
    ```
5. Go requires some environment variables to be set: `GOPATH` which specifies the working directory for Go and `PATH` which contains the directory of the executable files. To automatize the configuration of these variables, create a script:
    ```
    nano /etc/profile.d/env-go.sh
    ```
6. Edit the file as following before saving and exiting the text editor:
    ```
    export GOPATH=$HOME/go
    export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin
    ```
7. Make the script executable:
    ```
    chmod +x /etc/profile.d/env-go.sh
    ```
8. Import the file into the current shell:
    ```
    source /etc/profile.d/env-go.sh
    ```

## Deploying go-cve-dictionary

Vuls uses [go-cve-dictionary](https://github.com/kotakanbe/go-cve-dictionary), a Go package providing access to the [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/) (National Vulnerability Database) and the Japanese [JVN](https://jvndb.jvn.jp/en/), both providing information regarding security vulnerabilities according to their [CVE identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures) and a risk score.

1. Create a directory to store the data:
    ```
    mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github/kotakanbe
    ```
2. Enter the directory:
    ```
    cd $GOPATH/src/github/kotakanbe
    ```
3. Clone the sources from GitHub into the previously created directory:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/kotakanbe/go-cve-dictionary.git
    ```
4. Enter the downloaded sources directory:
    ```
    cd $GOPATH/src/github/kotakanbe/go-cve-dictionary
    ```
5. Compile the tool (_Keep in mind: This may take a while_):
    ```
    make install
    ```
6. Make it available system-wide, by copying the application into `/usr/local/bin`:
    ```
    sudo $GOPATH/bin/go-cve-dictionary /usr/local/bin
    ```
7. Fetch vulnerability data (starting from 2002) from the NVD and store it in the applications workspace (_This may take a while_):
    ```
    for i in `seq 2002 $(date +"%Y")`; do go-cve-dictionary fetchnvd -dbpath /usr/share/vuls/cve.sqlite3 -years $i; done
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      If you want to have results in Japanese, you need also fetch data from JVN:

      ```
      for i in `seq 1998 $(date +"%Y")`; do go-cve-dictionary fetchjvn -dbpath /usr/share/vuls/cve.sqlite3 -years $i; done
      ```
    </Message>

## Deploying goval-dictionary

1. Enter the working directory:
    ```

    ```
2. Clone [goval-dictionary](https://github.com/kotakanbe/goval-dictionary) from GitHub into the local directory:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/kotakanbe/goval-dictionary.git
    ```
3. Enter the directory of the application:
    ```
    cd $GOPATH/src/github/kotakanbe/goval-dictionary
    ```
4. Compile the application:
    ```
    make install
    ```
5. Copy the binary file to `/usr/local/bin` to make it available system wide:
    ```
    cp $GOPATH/bin/goval-dictionary /usr/local/bin
    ```
6. Fetch the OVAL data for [Ubuntu 18.x](https://github.com/kotakanbe/goval-dictionary#usage-fetch-oval-data-from-ubuntu) by running the following command:
    ```
    goval-dictionary fetch-ubuntu -dbpath=/usr/share/vuls/oval.sqlite3 18
    ```

    <Message type="important">

## Configuring Vuls

1. Open a configuration file `/usr/share/vuls/config.toml` and edit it as follows:
    ```
    [cveDict]
    type = "sqlite3"
    SQLite3Path = "/usr/share/vuls/cve.sqlite3"

    [ovalDict]
    type = "sqlite3"
    SQLite3Path = "/usr/share/vuls/oval.sqlite3"

    [exploit]
    type = "sqlite3"
    SQLite3Path = "/usr/share/vuls/exploitdb.sqlite3"

    [servers]

    [servers.localhost]
    host = "localhost"
    port = "local"
    scanMode = [ "fast" ]  # "fast", "fast-root" or "deep"
    ```
2. Test the configuration:
    ```
    vuls configtest
    ```

    An output like the following appears:

    ```
    [Mar 19 16:44:12]  INFO [localhost] Validating config...
    [Mar 19 16:44:12]  INFO [localhost] Detecting Server/Container OS...

    [Mar 19 16:44:13]  INFO [localhost] Checking dependencies...
    [Mar 19 16:44:13]  INFO [localhost] Dependencies... Pass
    [Mar 19 16:44:13]  INFO [localhost] Checking sudo settings...
    [Mar 19 16:44:13]  INFO [localhost] sudo ... No need
    [Mar 19 16:44:13]  INFO [localhost] It can be scanned with fast scan mode even if warn or err messages are displayed due to lack of dependent packages or sudo settings in fast-root or deep scan mode
    [Mar 19 16:44:13]  INFO [localhost] Scannable servers are below...
    localhost
    ```
3. Run a scan on localhost:
    ```
    vuls scan
    ```
4. Examine the results:
    ```
    vuls tui
    ```

    The report view is divided into four parts:
      - **Scanned machines** in the top left part displays a list of machines scanned by Vuls.
      - **Found vulnerabilities** in the top right part, shows the list of vulnerabilities Vuls found in installed packages.
      - **Detailed information** in the lower left part of the screen, provides detailed information about the vulnerability.
      - **Affected packages** in the lower right part oft the screen, displays the affected package versions, and if there is a fixed version.

## Scanning multiple machines (Optional)

Vuls is capable of performing security checks on multiple machines. To configure a new target, it is required to be in possession of:

- the remote server's IP address
- root access on the machine
- the ability to create an additional user account on the remote machine

1. Connect to the remote server as `root` via [SSH](https://www.scaleway.com/docs/create-and-connect-to-your-server/#-Logging-into-the-Instance).
2. Update the APT package cache, the already installed software on the Instance and install `sudo` and `debian-goodies`, which is required for Vuls:
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y && apt installl sudo debian-goodies -y
    ```
3. Create an user for Vuls with the `adduser` command:
    ```
    adduser vuls
    ```

    Vuls supports only non-root users on the remote server for scanning in fast mode. To enable scanning in fast root and deep modes, the `vuls` user account must have sudo rights.
4. Create a sudoers file for the `vuls` account:
    ```
    nano /etc/sudoers.d/30-vuls-users
    ```
5. Edit the sudoers file as following, to allow certain actions to be run without being prompted for a password:
    ```
    vuls ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get update, /usr/bin/stat *, /usr/sbin/checkrestart
    ```
6. Add the user to the sudoers file:
    ```
    adduser vuls sudo
    ```
7. Create a [SSH key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/) for on the Vuls master instance:
    ```
    ssh-keygen -o
    ```
8. Retrieve the public key:
    ```
    cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub
    ```
9. On the remote server, being logged into the `vuls` user, add the key in the file `.ssh/authorized_keys`.
10. Restart SSH on the remote server:
    ```
    sudo sshd restart
    ```
11. On the Vuls master server, add a block to the `/usr/share/vuls/config.toml` file:
    ```
    [servers.remote_host]
    host = "remote_host_ip_address"
    port = "22"
    user = "vuls"
    keyPath = "path_to_the_private_ssh_key"
    scanMode = [ "deep" ] # "fast", "fast-root" or "deep"
    ```
12. Verify that the configuration is working by running:
    ```
    vuls configtest
    ```

    An output like the following appears:

    ```
    [Mar 20 10:14:13]  INFO [localhost] Validating config...
    [Mar 20 10:14:13]  INFO [localhost] Detecting Server/Container OS...

    [Mar 20 10:14:18]  INFO [remote_host] Sudo... Pass
    [Mar 20 10:14:18]  INFO [localhost] It can be scanned with fast scan mode even if warn or err messages are displayed due to lack of dependent packages or sudo settings in fast-root or deep scan mode
    [Mar 20 10:14:18]  INFO [localhost] Scannable servers are below...
    localhost remote_host
    ```

## Configuring Slack notifications and periodic scanning

Vuls is able to send notifications on [Slack](https://www.slack.com) channels, by using Webhooks.

1. When logged into Slack, create a [new app](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1).
2. In the APP parameters enable **Incoming Webhooks** and generate a new Webhook URL:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-vuls_webhook.webp" alt="" />
3. Edit the file `/usr/share/vuls/config.toml` and add a Slack block to it:
    ```
    [slack]
    hookURL      = "wehook_url"
    channel      = "#slack_channel_name"
    authUser     = "slack_username"
    #notifyUsers  = ["@username"] #Uncomment to notify a user each time Vuls sends a report
    ```
4. Test the configuration by running the following command:
    ```
    vuls report -to-slack
    ```

    Vuls sends a first report to Slack:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-vuls_slack.webp" alt="" />
5. To run Vuls periodically, create a cronjob by running `crontab -e`.
6. Edit the `crontab` as following:
    ```
    0 0 * * * vuls scan -config=/usr/share/vuls/config.toml; vuls report -config=/usr/share/vuls/config.toml > /dev/null 2>&1
    ```

This will run Vuls every day at noon and send the report to Slack.

## Configuring VulsRepo (optional)

Vuls provides a graphical web based interface, called [VulsRepo](https://github.com/usiusi360/vulsrepo) to visualize the reports generated by Vuls.

1. Enter the Vuls directory:
    ```
    cd /usr/share/vuls
    ```
2. Clone [VulsRepo](https://github.com/usiusi360/vulsrepo) from GitHub into the local directory:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/usiusi360/vulsrepo.git
    ```
3. Enter the directory of the application:
    ```
    cd /usr/share/vuls/vulsrepo/server
    ```
4. Create a configuration file by copying the example shipped with the application:
    ```
    cp vulsrepo-config.toml.sample vulsrepo-config.toml
    ```
5. Open the configuration file in a text editor and edit it as following:
    ```
    [Server]
    rootPath = "/usr/share/vuls/vulsrepo"
    resultsPath  = "/usr/share/vuls/results"
    serverPort  = "5111"
    ```
6. Generate a JSON report with Vuls:
    ```
    vuls report -format-json -config=/usr/share/vuls/config.toml
    ```
7. Run the server:
    ```
    /usr/share/vuls/vulsrepo/vulsrepo-server
    ```
8. Open a web browser and point it to `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:5111` to visualize the Vuls reports:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-vuls_reports.webp" alt="" />
9. (Optionally) Configure a [Nginx reverse proxy](/tutorials/nginx-reverse-proxy/) to restrict the access to the reports.
