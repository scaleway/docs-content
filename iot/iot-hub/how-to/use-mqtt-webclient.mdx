An MQTT WebClient is embedded in the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com/iot-hub/hubs).

You can use it to connect to your Hub as a Device and publish and subscribe to topics on the Hub without having to set up a command line tool on your computer.

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have [created an IoT Hub](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/create-hub/)
  - You have [added a device](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/add-device/) that allows insecure connections to your Hub.

</Message>

1. Open the WebClient by either:

    - Clicking **MQTT Webclient** on the top right corner of the Device overview tab.
    - Clicking the open-in-a-new-window button next to Default WebSocket Network on the Hub's Networks list.
  
    <Message type="note">

      If you opened the WebClient from the Device overview tab, you will be automatically connected to the Hub with this Device. If you opened the Webclient from the Networks tab, you must set the `Username` field to a valid Device ID and click the connect button.

    </Message>

  Once you connect to the Webclient, you can perfom different operations. In this how to, we indicate how to subscribe to a topic, publish a message, and verify the message was received.

2. Click **Add a new subscription** in the **Subscriptions** panel.

3. Choose `my/topic` as the topic and click **Subscribe**.

4. Write `my/topic` under the **Topic** field, and `Hello World` in the **Message** field in the **Publish** panel. Then, click **Publish**.

  The message should appears in the **Messages**.
