## I tried to add a credit card, but I got a "card already registered" message

### Cause
A credit card can only be registered once across all Scaleway Organizations. This means that if your card is already linked to another Scaleway account, you will not be able to add it again.

### Solution
- Ensure that the credit card is not already registered to another Scaleway account. If you have multiple accounts, verify if the card is linked to one of them.
- If the card is already in use, consider adding a different credit card to your account.
