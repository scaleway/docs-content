Visibility specifies whether your object is visible to others or not.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created an Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)
</Message>

<Message type="note">
  All objects are private by default, even if they are in a public bucket. A private file in a public bucket cannot be accessed publicly.
</Message>

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the name of your bucket. A list of your objects displays.
3. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the selected object name.
4. Click **Visibility**. A pop-up appears.

5. Check **Public** or **Private** according to your preference.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-pop-up-object-visibility.webp" alt="" />
6. Click **Update object visibility** to confirm.

<Message type="important">
  You can only configure the visibility (public or private) of one object at a time. It is not possible to perform this action on an entire bucket, on which visibility is defined by default as private. Allowing public visibility of a bucket only allows the viewing of a list of objects that are stored in the bucket.
</Message>

<Message type="tip">
If you upload a file using the CLI, you can make it public by using the `--acl public-read` parameter.
