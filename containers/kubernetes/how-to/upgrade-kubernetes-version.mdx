You can either upgrade your Kubernetes Kapsule cluster [directly from the Scaleway console](#upgrading-a-kapsule-cluster-from-the-scaleway-console), or upgrade your cluster to the next minor version by [using the CLI](#upgrading-a-kapsule-cluster-to-the-next-minor-version-using-the-cli).

## Upgrading a Kapsule cluster from the Scaleway console

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster) a Kubernetes Kapsule cluster running on a Kubernetes version older than the latest release
</Message>

1. Click **Kubernetes** under **Containers** on the side menu. A list of your Kubernetes Kapsule clusters displays.
2. Click the cluster name you wish to upgrade the Kubernetes version for. The cluster information page displays.
    <Message type="tip">
      Alternatively you can click <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to display the cluster information page.
    </Message>
3. Click **Upgrade** next to the **Kubernetes version** of your cluster. A pop-up displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubernetes-cluster-upgrade.webp" alt="" />
4. Select the Kubernetes version you want to upgrade to from the drop-down list. Tick the **Upgrade cluster node pools as well** checkbox if you want to upgrade the version of Kubernetes on the node pools in your cluster to the same version. 
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubernetes-version-select.webp" alt="" />
    <Message type="important">
      Be careful when upgrading the Kubernetes versions of your node pools, as it may lead to data loss on data stored locally on any node.
    </Message>
 5. Click **Upgrade**.
    <Message type="note">
      It is not possible to downgrade your Kubernetes version once it has been upgraded.

## Upgrading a Kapsule cluster to the next minor version using the CLI

<Message type="requirement">
    - You have a working [CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli) with your credentials set up
    - You are willing to upgrade your Kubernetes Kapsule cluster to the latest k8s version available on the Kapsule API.
</Message>


To begin, it is essential to verify that the most recent version of Kapsule adequately supports your workload. We maintain a compatibility matrix for various components, as your current cluster might use components deprecated or unavailable in the latest version.
For further details, please consult our [version policy](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/containers/kubernetes/reference-content/version-support-policy/).

We recommend you read the Kubernetes [changelog](https://kubernetes.io/releases/) to stay informed on the latest version upgrade.

### Checking which components must be changed

Run the following command into your terminal to retrieve a list of the components that need to be changed.

```
scw k8s version list
```

You should get an output similar to the following, providing a list of all relevant components:
```
1.25.9   [cilium calico kilo]                [none]                 [containerd]
1.24.13  [cilium calico weave flannel kilo]  [none]                 [containerd crio]
1.23.17  [cilium calico weave flannel kilo]  [none nginx traefik2]  [containerd crio docker]
```

### Ingresses

Managed Ingress Controllers have been deprecated since the minor 1.24 release. As a result, we provide the [Easy Deploy feature](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/enable-easy-deploy/) instead to set up an Ingress Controller.
You can also deploy an Ingress Controller by yourself and fine-tune its settings according to your needs.

Run the `scw k8s cluster update $CLUSTER_ID ingress=none` command to update a cluster to a version superior to 1.23. It is necessary to deactivate the managed Ingress Controller.

### Container runtimes

We only provide support for `containerd` from version 1.25 and above. To migrate your existing pools, you must create new Kapsule pools with `containerd` as a runtime.
Complete the following steps to do so:
1. Create the pool:
    ```sh
    scw k8s pool create container-runtime=containerd zone=$POOL_ZONE size=$SIZE_OF_YOUR_OLD_POOL version=$YOUR_CLUSTER_VERSION cluster-id=$CLUSTER_ID
    ```
2. Wait for the nodes to be provisioned:
    ```sh
    scw k8s pool wait $POOL_ID
    ```
3. In parallel, you can start cordoning nodes using the old runtime. This way, the workload will get rescheduled directly on the `containerd` nodes.
    ```sh
    kubectl cordon $OLD_NODE_A $OLD_NODE_B $OLD_NODE_C ...
    ```
4. Once the new nodes are ready, you can start draining the old nodes:
    <Message type="note">
      You may need to add the option `--delete-emptydir-data` if you used local disk as a scratchpad.
    </Message>
    ```sh
    kubectl drain --ignore-daemonsets $NODE_TO_DRAIN
    ```
    <Message type="important">
      **Do not** drain all the nodes simultaneously. Make sure to do it sequentially, while checking whether your workload is behaving as expected.
    </Message>
5. At this point, nodes from your old pool should be emptied of any workload. If so, they are ready for deletion:
    ```sh
    kubectl delete node $OLD_NODE_A $OLD_NODE_B $OLD_NODE_C ...
    ```
6. Delete your old pool:
    ```sh
    scw k8s pool delete $OLD_POOL_ID
    ```

### CNIs

If your cluster is using a deprecated CNI, and you are willing to upgrade to a newer k8s version, you will most likely have to spin up a new Kapsule cluster.
As of now, we do not provide an easy way to change CNI. This component is integrated within each cluster node. This results in a tricky transition.
For more help, check out the following resources:
- The #k8s channel on our [Slack community](https://scaleway-community.slack.com)
- Our [support ticketing system](/console/my-account/how-to/open-a-support-ticket/)

### Effective upgrade

From here, two options are available: you are either upgrading **one minor version** or **multiple ones**.

#### One minor version

This option is the most straightforward and requires you to first upgrade your control-plane.
```sh
scw k8s cluster upgrade $CLUSTER_ID version=$NEW_K8S_VERSION
```

<Message type="tip">
  You can also upgrade the pools by appending the previous command with `upgrade-pools=true`.
</Message>

Additionally, you can upgrade one pool independently by running the following command:
```sh
scw k8s pool upgrade $POOL_ID version=$NEW_K8S_VERSION
```

If you wish to migrate your workload manually, you can do so by following the steps described in the [runtimes](#container-runtimes) section.
<Message type="important">
  Make sure to adapt the pool creation step.
</Message>
```sh
scw k8s pool create zone=$OLD_POOL_ZONE size=$SIZE_OF_YOUR_OLD_POOL version=$NEW_CLUSTER_VERSION cluster-id=$CLUSTER_ID
```

Monitor your workload, congrats you are using a newer, maybe the latest Kubernetes version.

#### Multiple minors versions

The process is quite similar to the previous one except you need to repeat the steps for each minor version.
