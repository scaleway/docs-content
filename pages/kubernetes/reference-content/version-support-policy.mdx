[Kubernetes (K8s)](https://kubernetes.io) is an open source project that is constantly evolving, integrating and deprecating features and applying bug fixes. The project is supported by the community, which releases between four and six new minor versions every year.

With Scaleway Kubernetes, you can use the latest version of Kubernetes as soon as it is officially released and certified by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/). The versions are usually available in Kubernetes Kapsule and Kubernetes Kosmos within a few days after the release.

## Version management recommendation

We recommend that you keep your Kubernetes clusters up-to-date with the latest available minor version of Kubernetes and the latest patches.

<Message type="note">
  Each minor Kubernetes version is supported by Scaleway Kubernetes for at least twelve months before being deprecated.

### Cluster auto-upgrade

Before using the auto-upgrade feature, it is essential to differentiate between patch upgrades and minor version upgrades in Kubernetes. While a patch upgrade typically focuses on bug fixes and security patches without altering existing functionalities, a minor version upgrade introduces new features and changes.

The [Kubernetes Kapsule](https://www.scaleway.com/en/kubernetes-kapsule/) and [Kubernetes Kosmos](https://www.scaleway.com/en/kubernetes-kosmos/) platforms offer an auto-upgrade feature to address patch upgrades within the same minor Kubernetes version you are currently using. This means that the feature allows for updates to the latest patch, ensuring enhanced security and stability without introducing major changes.

This upgrade applies to both the control plane and the managed node versions of Kubernetes. You can activate this feature through the API, CLI, or the Scaleway console. Note, to ensure smooth operation of the auto-upgrade, the `kube-system` namespace should remain untouched and free from any user-initiated modifications that might cause issues with the upgrade process.

If you are looking to upgrade to the next minor version of Kubernetes, refer to our [documentation on upgrading to the next minor version](/kubernetes/how-to/upgrade-kubernetes-version/).

## Support

Before opening a support ticket related to cluster behavior or a Kubernetes component, we highly recommend that you upgrade the cluster to the latest version of Kubernetes. If the upgrade to a new minor version is not possible, the latest patch of the version running on the cluster must be applied.

80% of Kubernetes issues are usually fixed when applying the latest patch version available.
