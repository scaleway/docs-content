<Macro id="webhosting-online" />

**F**ile **T**ransfer **P**rotcol is a standard way to transfer files between a client (such as your local computer) and a server (such as your Scaleway webhosting server) via the internet. In order to [use FTP](/dedibox-console/classic-hosting/how-to/connect-via-ftp/), you must first create an account.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net)
  - You have created a **Webhosting Classic**
</Message>

## How to create an FTP account

1. Click **Hosting**, then **Manage**.
2. Click the **FTP accounts** tab.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_ftp_tab.webp" alt="" />

    A form displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway_ftpaccounts.webp" alt="" />
3. Fill in the form to create your FTP account, entering the following values: 
    * a **username** (eg `webmaster`)
    * a **password** of your choice
    * a **path**, which has to be an existing directory on your FTP. Enter `/` to create an account with access to the whole directory, or a specific path to limit access to certain directories.
4. Validate your entries.
    <Message type="note">
      Your FTP account appears in the account list with the status **Waiting to create**. Your account will be activated in approximately one hour.

    When you [connect to your FTP account](/dedibox-console/classic-hosting/how-to/connect-via-ftp/), the following folders display:   
    * `awffull` (contains your old access statistics, if they were activated)
    * `www` (should contain your website)
    * `logs` (contains your old access statistics, if they were activated)
    * `UPLOADER_VOTRE_SITE_DANS_LE_REPERTOIRE_WWW` (this directory serves simply as a reminder as to where to upload your website files)

    <Message type="important">
      - Keep in mind that your website is located in the folder `/www` on the FTP server. 
      - Upload all your website's content into this folder.
    </Message>

## How to limit the access to an FTP account 

To limit access to an FTP account, create the folder you want to access (example: `client`) in the folder `www` (the one containing your website). Then follow these steps:

1. Log into the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net)
2. Click **Hosting**, then click **Manage**.
3. Click the **FTP accounts** tab.
4. Enter **/www/client/** in the **Directory** field of your new account.
    <Message type="important">
      Ensure that you follow the syntax `/www/directory/` in order for your account to work.
