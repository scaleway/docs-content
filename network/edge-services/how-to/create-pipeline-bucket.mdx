Edge Services is an additional feature for Scaleway Load Balancers and Object Storage buckets, currently available in [Public Beta](https://www.scaleway.com/en/betas/).

Enabling Edge Services on your Object Storage bucket creates an Edge Services pipeline which brings you a number of possible benefits:

- Customize your bucket's endpoint using a subdomain of your own domain
- Add your own SSL/TLS certificate, safeguarded in [Scaleway Secret Manager](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/quickstart/), or generate a managed Let's Encrypt certificate, so your subdomain can serve content from your bucket over HTTPS
- Enhance performance by caching your stored objects, to be served directly by Edge Services from the cache
- Finely control your cached objects via purging (cache invalidation)

Read on to learn how to create an Edge Services pipeline by enabling Edge Services on your bucket.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)

## How to create an Edge Services pipeline

Edge Services is available as a feature on Object Storage buckets. You enable it on a bucket-by-bucket basis. When you enable Edge Services on a particular bucket, a [pipeline](/network/edge-services/concepts/#pipeline) is automatically created for that bucket.

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of your buckets displays.

2. Click the name of the bucket you want to enable Edge Services on.

3. Click the **Edge Services** tab.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-services-splash.webp" alt="A screenshot of the Scaleway console shows the Edge Services tab for the selected bucket: it is in an empty state, with a button inviting you to enable Edge Services." />

4. Click **Enable Edge Services for free**.

    A pop-up informs you that your bucket will be exposed via Edge Services and that you can disable Edge Services at any time. Edge Services is free during the beta stage, and you will be notified before it becomes billable.

5. Click **Enable Edge Services** to confirm.

    Edge Services is enabled on your bucket, and a pipeline is automatically created. Various features are now visible on the Edge Services tab, ready to be configured.

    <Message type="important">

    Your bucket's [visibility](/storage/object/concepts/#visibility) can be set to **private**, but any objects within it that you want to expose via Edge Services must be set to [**public** visibility](/storage/object/how-to/manage-object-visibility/). However, in the case that you are using Edge Services with bucket website, objects can remain private.

## How to access your bucket via Edge Services

Once you have enabled Edge Services on your bucket, you can access your bucket and its content via the following endpoints. Make sure that you replace `bucket-name` with the name of your bucket.

| Endpoint                                | Where to find this endpoint in the console | Notes                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `https://bucket-name.s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud` | The **Bucket settings** tab                | Edge Services is bypassed when the bucket is accessed via this endpoint  |
| `https://bucket-name.svc.edge.scw.cloud`  | The **Edge Services** tab                  | Edge Services serves bucket content when this endpoint is used |

The two endpoints shown above are available as standard. However, with Edge Services, you can also choose to configure a **custom domain** from which your bucket can be accessed. Read more about this in the [next section](/network/edge-services/how-to/configure-custom-domain/).
