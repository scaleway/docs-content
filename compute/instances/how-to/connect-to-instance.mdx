This page shows how to connect to your Scaleway Instance via SSH. Thanks to the SSH key that you created and uploaded, you can use a terminal application on your local computer to remotely connect to your Instance as root. This enables you to use your Instance as you wish.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created your SSH key and added it to your account](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
  - You have [created an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance)
</Message>

## How to connect from OSX (Mac) and Linux

1. Open a terminal program.
2. Enter the command below into the terminal. Make sure you replace `your_private_key` with the filename of your private key (often `id_ed25519`) and `your_instance_ip` with the IP address of your Instance.
    ```sh
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_private_key root@your_instance_ip
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
    To find the IP address of your Instance, log into the Scaleway console and
    click **Instances** in the Compute section of the side menu. A list of your
    Instances and their associated IP addresses will display.

    </Message>
3. If / when prompted, allow connection to the host by typing `yes`, then press **Enter**.
    ```
    The authenticity of host 'myhost.ext (212.47.226.35)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is 4f:ba:65:cf:14:64:a7:1e:b6:07:7c:00:71:95:21:fa.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
    ```

You are now connected to your Instance.

## How to connect from Windows

To connect to your Instance from Windows, you will need to use a small application called **PuTTY**, an SSH client.

1. [Download and install PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).
2. Launch PuTTY on your computer. The main screen of the application displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-putty-main.webp" alt="" />
3. Enter your Instance's IP address in the **Hostname** field.
    <Message type="tip">
      To find the IP address of your Instance, log into the Scaleway console and
      click **Instances** in the Compute section of the side menu. A list of your
      Instances and their associated IP addresses will display.
    </Message>
4. In the side menu, under **Connection** navigate to the **Auth** sub-category. Do this by expanding **Connection**, then **SSH** and finally clicking on **Auth**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-putty-ssh.webp" alt="" />
5. Click the **Browse** button and select the private key file you [generated previously](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/).
6. Click **Open** at the bottom of the screen to open a connection to the Instance. Upon the first connection, PuTTY asks you to allow the connection to the host.
7. Click **OK** to confirm.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-putty-security.webp" alt="" />

    The terminal window displays.
8. Enter the username `root` and press **Enter** to authenticate against the server with your SSH key.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-putty-logged.webp" alt="" />

You are now connected to your Instance.
