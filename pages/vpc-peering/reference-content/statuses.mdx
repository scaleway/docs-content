## VPC Peering connector statuses

A VPC Peering connector always has a **status**.

This section explains the different statuses possible for a peering connector, and how to understand them.

| **Status**             | **Description**                         | 
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Pending/Configuring**       | The connector is configuring and is in a transient state. No user actions can be carried out. This status generally occurs after a new configuration is being applied, or you have just created a connector. This status should be momentary: if it persists, contact support. |
| **Orphan**       | The connector has been created, but no matching connector has been created for the target VPC. There is no VPC peering connection between the two VPCs. An owner or manager of the target VPC must create a matching connector, where their VPC is defined as origin and yours is defined as target. |
| **Peered**             | This connector has matched with a compatible connector for the target VPC, and a peering connection is established between the two VPCs.  |
| **Conflict**             | This connector has matched with a connector for the target VPC, but the two VPCs contain Private Networks with overlapping CIDR ranges. No VPC peering connection can be established until the [conflict is resolved](/vpc-peering/troubleshooting/resolving-peering-conflicts/). |
| **Locked**             | The connector has been locked by the Trust and Safety team. You cannot carry out any actions on the connector. Open a support ticket. |
