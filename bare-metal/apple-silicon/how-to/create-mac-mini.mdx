This page shows how to create your first [Mac mini](/bare-metal/apple-silicon/concepts/#mac-mini) with the Scaleway console.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)

<Message type="important">
  Due to license constraints, the minimum lease for Apple silicon is 24 hours. As a result, the earliest you can delete a Mac mini is 24 hours after the start of its lease.

1. Click **Apple silicon** in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu. The Apple silicon splash page displays.

      Should your account already contain Mac minis, a list of these will be displayed rather than the Apple silicon splash page.
      Alongside, you will see a (+ Create Mac mini) button, which you can click to create a new Mac mini.

2. Click **Create Mac mini**. The Mac mini creation wizard displays.
3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Choose an **Availability Zone**, which is the geographical region where your Mac mini will be deployed. The available Mac mini configurations depend on the Availability Zone:
      - Mac mini M2 pro and M2 are available in PARIS 1
      - Mac mini M1 are available in PARIS 3
    - Choose a macOS version. Note that if you choose a macOS other than the one installed by default, there will be a delay of about 1 hour before the Mac mini is made available.
    - Enter a **Name** for your Mac mini, or leave the randomly-generated name in place.
    - Verify the **Estimated cost** for your Mac mini based on your chosen specifications.
4. Click **Create Mac mini** to finish. The installation of your Apple silicon is launched, and you are informed when it is ready.
