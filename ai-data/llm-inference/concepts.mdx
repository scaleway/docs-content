## Context size

The **context size** refers to the length or size of the input text used to generate predictions or responses from a large language model. It plays a crucial role in determining the model's understanding of the given prompt or query.

## Deployment

A **deployment** involves the process of making a trained language model available for use in real-world applications. It encompasses tasks such as integrating the model into existing systems, optimizing its performance, and ensuring scalability and reliability.

## Embedding Models

Embedding models are a type of representation learning technique used to convert textual data into numerical vectors. These vectors capture semantic information about the text and are often used as input to downstream machine learning models or algorithms.

## Endpoint

An **endpoint** in the context of large language models refers to a network-accessible URL or interface through which clients can interact with the model for inference tasks. It exposes methods for sending input data and receiving model predictions or responses.

## Fine-tuning

Fine-tuning involves the process of further training a pre-trained language model on domain-specific or task-specific data to improve its performance on a particular task. This process often involves updating the model's parameters using a smaller, task-specific dataset.

## Few-shot prompting

**Few-shot prompting** is a technique used to generate responses from a language model using only a few examples or prompts as input. It leverages the model's ability to generalize from limited training data to produce coherent and contextually relevant outputs.

## Instructions

Instructions refer to the guidelines or specifications provided to a language model to direct its behavior or response during inference. These instructions can take various forms, including prompts, queries, or specific formatting requirements for the desired output.

## Large Language Model Applications

**Large Language Model Applications** are applications or software tools that leverage the capabilities of large language models for various tasks, such as text generation, summarization, or translation. These apps provide user-friendly interfaces for interacting with the models and accessing their functionalities.

## Quantization

Quantization is a technique used to reduce the precision of numerical values in a model's parameters or activations to improve efficiency and reduce memory footprint during inference. It involves representing floating-point values with a lower number of bits while minimizing the loss of accuracy.

## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework that combines elements of information retrieval with language generation to enhance the capabilities of large language models. It involves retrieving relevant context or knowledge from external sources and incorporating it into the generation process to produce more informative and contextually grounded outputs.
