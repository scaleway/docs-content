The Webhook event status indicates the status of the webhook delivery.

These are the different event statuses:

- `unknown_status`: The status of the event is unknown by default. This status is used when the event status has not been specified.
- `sending`: The webhook event is being sent. This means that the notification is in transit to the configured URL.
- `sent`: The webhook event was successfully sent. This status indicates that the notification was received by the configured URL.
- `failed`: The webhook event could not be sent after multiple attempts. This status means there were repeated errors during the attempt to send the notification.
