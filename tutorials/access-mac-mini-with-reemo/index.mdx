## Reeemo - Overview

Reemo is an ultra-low latency, high-performance desktop platform designed to allow anyone to connect to any computer and virtual environment from a Chrome browser to work and play freely from anywhere, on any device. 
Reemo works perfectly on MacOS, Linux, and Windows and supports multiple peripherals. _Reemo is a French startup that was part of the Scaleway Startup Program._

Scaleway's Apple silicon M1 as-a-Service offer is highly compatible with Reemo.io. Scaleway's Mac mini M1 is built using the latest generation of Apple Mac mini hardware.
These dedicated Mac mini M1 are designed for developing, building, testing, and signing applications for Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, Mac computers and much more. Reemo.io can be installed easily on Scaleway's Mac mini M1 which allows you to instantly connect to your M1 remotely from a chrome browser while keeping its performance and efficiency.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to launch your Mac mini M1 development environment on Reemo.io.

      when installing it for the first time on Linux and MacOS. To change or edit this private key, you can use the Reemo.exe on Windows or edit the `reemo.ini` file directly, located at `/Library/Application Support/Reemo/reemo.ini` on MacOS.

## Installing the Reemo client

1. Log into your Mac mini M1. You can [connect](/bare-metal/apple-silicon/how-to/connect-to-mac-mini-m1/) to your machine either using the VNC client or via SSH. 
2. If you are logged into the Mac mini M1 via VNC, open a terminal. If you are connected via SSH you can skip this step.
3. Run the following command to install the Reemo client on your machine:
    ```sh 
    curl -skL -o /tmp/install_reemo.x 'https://download.reemo.io/macos/setup.x' && sudo bash /tmp/install_reemo.x
    ```

4. Enter the **private key** of your Reemo account when prompted. Press Enter to validate.
5. Give Reemo access to screen recording (necessary for it to work).

Then, in **System Settings**, click **Privacy & Security** in the sidebar (you may need to scroll down). Then click **Screen Recording** and turn on screen recording for the Reemo app.
