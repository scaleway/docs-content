## Overview

A new version of Messaging and Queuing has been released. In the new version, the concept of **namespaces** has been removed, to streamline your workflows, offer you a better developer experience, and simplify the management of your Messaging and Queuing resources.

The release of this new version in the Scaleway console coincides with the [NATS](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#nats) and [SQS](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#sqs) protocols leaving [Public Beta](https://www.scaleway.com/en/betas/) and going into General Availability (GA). This means that the Messaging and Queuing product, when used with these protocols, is now billable. [SNS](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#sns) will remain in Public Beta for now while we continue testing and improving the product as you use it.

Your NATS resources have been automatically migrated to the new version of the product. However, for SQS and SNS you will need to migrate, by recreating your resources in the new version. You can do this via the API or the console.

Migrating to the new version is very important, as on the 1st of December 2023, the old product version will be retired. All resources still present in the old version will be deleted.

For all protocols, the endpoints of your brokers has changed in the new version, and you will need to update these endpoints in any code, applications or architectures using your message brokers.

Read on to find out more about the new no-namespace version of the product, and how migration works for the protocols you use.

## The previous situation: v1alpha1 and namespaces

Whether you create and manage your NATS or SQS/SNS namespaces and credentials via our [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/) or our [console](https://console.scaleway.com/), they both pointed towards the same underlying version of the product: `v1alpha1`, which held your resources.

In this previous version of the product, you created **namespaces**, setting the **protocol** for each namespace as either **NATS** or **SQS/SNS**. Each namespace gave you a **URL** (or endpoint) representing a Messaging and Queuing broker, and also allowed you to create **credentials** to access that particular namespace. When you created messages, queues, streams, topics and other resources, they were scoped to that namespace.

## What's changed: v1beta1 and no more namespaces

`v1alpha1` is now deprecated, and `v1beta1` is in production, representing the new and improved Messaging and Queuing product.

In this new version of the product, the concept of namespaces has been removed:

- For **NATS** namespaces have been replaced by **accounts**. You can create one or multiple NATS accounts, and credentials for each account. Each account will have its own URL/endpoint.
- **SQS** and **SNS** have been separated into two distinct protocols. Instead of creating a namespace, you simply **activate** each protocol. You can then create credentials for each protocol. If you previously used multiple SQS or SNS namespaces to separate resources, you should now use [Scaleway Projects](/console/project/concepts/#project) to separate your resources.

## From Public Beta to General Availability: impact on billing

The change to the new "no-namespace" version of Messaging and Queuing coincides with the NATS and SQS protocols moving into General Availability. This means that the beta testing phase is over, and you are now billed for your use of Messaging and Queuing with NATS and SQS protocols. 

Billing is based on:

- For **NATS**: **Stream volume** (the number of messages sent * the message size) and **stream persistence** (the total amount of data stored * duration)
- For **SQS**: **Queue volume** (the number of messages sent * the message size)

Full details of price points and how the billing model works are displayed in the console when you create a NATS account or an SQS queue, or can be viewed on [our website](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/?tags=available).

<Message type="important">
The precise start of the billing period for NATS and SQS is defined as the time of General Availability, **not** as the time of the migration to the new `v1beta1` "no-namespace" version of the product. This means that messages sent using both the old and new versions are billed from GA onwards.
</Message>

Note that **SNS** has not yet moved into General Availability, but will instead stay in Public Beta while we continue to work on testing and improving this product. This means that you will not yet be billed for using Messaging and Queuing with the SNS protocol, even though the `v1beta1` version is also now used for SNS.

## Migration: timescales and action to take

Below, we explain for each protocol how to migrate from the old to the new Messaging and Queuing.

### NATS

Scaleway has automatically migrated each of your NATS namespaces and their credentials from the old version of Messaging and Queuing to the new one. In the new version, each NATS namespace you had is now a NATS account (each with its corresponding credentials). 

The migration should have been seamless: if you logged into the Scaleway console before migration/GA you saw the "old" version of Messaging and Queuing with your existing resources showing as namespaces. After migration/GA, you now see the "new" version with your newly migrated resources now showing as accounts.

In terms of the API, the old `v1alpha1` version continues to be available until the 1st of December 2023. After this date it will be retired and you must use the new [`v1beta1`](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/messaging-and-queuing/nats-api/) version. The documentation for both is accessible via the [Scaleway Developers website](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api). 

Internally, NATS namespaces (and their credentials) and NATS accounts (and their credentials) are the same resources, visible through both APIs. During the migration period, both APIs' endpoints are essentially accessing the same resources. Do not attempt to delete your NATS resources from the `v1alpha1` API, as this will also delete them from the new `v1beta1` API and console. You will not be billed "twice" for resources in the old and new API because these are essentially the same resources.

Note that **the URL/endpoint by which you access your NATS resources is not be the same in the two versions**. Before the 1st of December 2023, you **must** update any code, scripts, applications, and architectures using the old endpoint, to update to the new endpoint. After this time, the old endpoints will no longer be recognized.

The new URL/endpoint is visible in the console from your **Messaging** > **NATS** > **NATS Account** dashboard, and also from the new API.

If you are a Serverless Functions/Containers user, and have created NATS triggers with the `v1alpha1` version of the Messaging and Queuing API, you **must** recreate these triggers.

**Summary: NATS**

✅ Migration from the old to new API has been automatically performed for you <br />
✅ Billing of NATS resources began at the time of General Availability <br />
✅ You must update your code, applications and architectures so they use the new endpoint by the 1st of December 2023 <br />
✅ You must recreate your Serverless Functions/Containers NATS triggers if you have some

See our dedicated documentation, [How to migrate to the new Messaging and Queuing - NATS](/serverless/messaging/how-to/migrate-to-new-mnq/#nats).

### SQS

From the moment Messaging and Queuing with SQS went into General Availability, a 30 day period began, by the end of which you must migrate your SQS resources from the old to the new version. This period ends on the 1st of December 2023. You must migrate your resources yourself before this date: this will not be automatic like it will for NATS.

To migrate, you must **recreate your resources** (credentials and queues) in the new version. Remember that the new version of the API has no namespaces: you will simply **activate the SQS protocol** and then directly create your credentials and queues. SQS and SNS have been separated, so if you want to use both you will need to activate both separately and create separate credentials for both.

<Message type="tip">

If you previously had multiple namespaces to separate your SQS resources, we recommend that you use [Scaleway Projects](/console/project/concepts/#project) with the new version to handle this. By creating multiple Projects, activating SQS in each one, and then creating SQS credentials in each Project, you will be able to achieve separation of resources, and credentials scoped to the SQS broker of each Project.

</Message>

You can recreate your credentials and queues either via the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) or via the new `v1beta1` API directly. In terms of the API, the current `v1alpha1` version will continue to be available until the 1st of December 2023. 

**Console documentation**:
- [How to activate SQS](/serverless/messaging/how-to/get-started/)
- [How to create credentials](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-credentials/)
- [How to create queues](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-queues/)

**API documentation**:
- [SQS v1beta1 documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/messaging-and-queuing/sqs-api/)

Note the following important information about the migration/crossover period, during which both versions of the API exist:

**Before GA**
- Only the `v1alpha1` API was available. All your resources existed in this API.
- The console was based on this API, so when you viewed your resources in the console, you were viewing resources in the `v1alpha1` API.

**At the time of GA**
- The `v1alpha1` API is still available. Your resources continue to exist in this API until you delete them.
- The `v1beta1` API also becomes available. You should recreate your resources (credentials and queues) in this API.
- The console now uses the `v1beta1` API. **You are no longer able to see or manage your old resources from the `v1alpha1` API via the console**. Any resources now created via the console exist in the `v1beta1` API.
- Messaging and Queuing with SQS is now billable. Whether you are using the old version or the new one, via the API or other devtools or the console, you are now billed for the messages you send.

**From the 1st of December 2023**
- The `v1alpha1` API will be decommissioned. Any resources still existing on this API are deleted.

**The URL/endpoints for your Messaging and Queuing SQS service and for your queues are not the same in the two versions**. Make sure that when you recreate your resources with the new version, you remember to update the endpoint in any code, scripts, applications and architectures that were using the old endpoint. If you do not do so, they will continue to access the "old" resources rather than the new ones you have created for the new version.

The new URLs/endpoints are visible in the console from your **Messaging** > **SQS** dashboard, and also from the new API.

If you are a Serverless Functions/Containers user, and have created SQS triggers with the `v1alpha1` version of the Messaging and Queuing API, you **must** recreate these triggers.

**Summary: SQS**

✅ You must migrate from the old version to the new by recreating your resources and credentials <br />
✅ You must update your code, applications and architectures so they use the endpoints of the new version once you migrate <br />
✅ Billing of SQS resources began at the time of General Availability, and applies to both the old and new versions <br />
✅ All resources still existing on the old version will be deleted on the 1st of December 2023 <br />
✅ You must recreate your Serverless Functions/Containers SQS triggers if you have some

See our dedicated documentation, [How to migrate to the new Messaging and Queuing - SQS](/serverless/messaging/how-to/migrate-to-new-mnq/#sqs).

### SNS

SNS with Messaging and Queuing is not going into General Availability the way that NATS and SQS are. However, it has still moved from the existing old version (`v1alpha1`) to the new version (`v1beta1`) without namespaces. Therefore, even though you will not be billed for your SNS resources in the immediate future while it remains in Public Beta, there is still a migration to carry out.

At the time of the release of the new version (which coincided with SQS and NATS going into General Availability) a 30 day period began. You must [migrate your SNS resources from the old to the new version](/serverless/messaging/how-to/migrate-to-new-mnq/#sns) within this time period, which ends on the 1st of December 2023.

To migrate, you must **recreate your resources** in the new version. Remember that the new version of the API has no namespaces: you should simply **activate the SNS protocol** and then directly create your credentials. SQS and SNS have been separated, so if you want to use both you will need to activate both separately and create separate credentials for both.

<Message type="tip">

If you previously had multiple namespaces to separate your SNS resources, we recommend that you use [Scaleway Projects](/console/project/concepts/#project) with the new version to handle this.

You can recreate your credentials either via the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) (once the new version is in production) or via the new `v1beta1` API directly. In terms of the API, the current `v1alpha1` version will continue to be available until the 1st of December 2023. The documentation for both versions is accessible via the [Scaleway Developers website](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api).

**Console documentation**:
- [How to activate SNS](/serverless/messaging/how-to/get-started/)
- [How to create credentials](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-credentials/)

**API documentation**:
- [SNS v1beta1 documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/messaging-and-queuing/sns-api/)

Note the following important information about the migration/crossover period, when both versions of the API will exist:

**Before release of new version**
- Only the `v1alpha1` API was available. All your resources existed in this API.
- The console was based on this API, so when you viewed your resources in the console, you were viewing resources in the `v1alpha1` API.

**At the time that SQS and NATS went into GA**
- The `v1alpha1` API is still available. Your resources continue to exist in this API until you delete them.
- The `v1beta1` API also becomes available. You should recreate your resources in this API.
- The console now uses the `v1beta1` API. **You are no longer able to see or manage your old resources from the `v1alpha1` API via the console**. Any resources now created via the console exist in the `v1beta1` API.

**From the 1st of December 2023**
- The `v1alpha1` API will be decommissioned. Any resources still existing on this API will be deleted.

**The URL/endpoints for your Messaging and Queuing SNS service and for your topics are not the same in the two versions**. Make sure that when you recreate your resources with the new version, you remember to update the endpoint in any code, scripts, applications and architectures that were using the old endpoint. If you do not do so, they will continue to access the "old" resources rather than the new ones you have created for the new version.

The new URLs/endpoints are visible in the console from your **Messaging** > **SNS** dashboard, and also from the new API.

**Summary: SNS**

✅ You must migrate from the old version to the new by recreating your resources and credentials <br />
✅ You must update your code, applications and architectures so they use the endpoints of the new version once you migrate <br />
✅ SNS will remain in Public Beta (in both old and new versions) and will not yet be billed <br />
✅ All resources still existing on the old version will be deleted on the 1st of December 2023

See our dedicated documentation, [How to migrate to the new Messaging and Queuing - SNS](/serverless/messaging/how-to/migrate-to-new-mnq/#sns).

## Terraform

There is a new Terraform provider for the new version of Messaging and Queuing. The link will be published shortly.

If you manage Messaging and Queuing using the old Terraform provider, you will need to update your Terraform files to use the new provider, in line with the migration timelines laid out above.
