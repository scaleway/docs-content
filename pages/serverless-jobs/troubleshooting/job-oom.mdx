## Problem

My job runs out of memory (OOM) and crashes or restarts.

## Possible cause
	
Jobs uses [gVisor](https://gvisor.dev/) as a sandboxing solution to isolate the underlying client containers mutualized on the same host. Directories such as `/tmp` and `/dev` are stored in memory. This means that any data written to `/tmp` consumes memory directly. For example, writing a 100 MB file to `/tmp` will increase the container's memory usage by the same amount.

Excessive writes to `/tmp` can fill up the provisioned memory, leading to out-of-memory (OOM) errors, potentially triggering a job restart.

## Solutions

- Avoid writing temporary files in `/tmp`.
- Use alternative storage paths within your job
- Increase the job's memory allocation to accommodate for temporary file usage
