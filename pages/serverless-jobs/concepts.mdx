## Container Registry

Container Registry is the place where your images are stored before being deployed. We recommend using Scaleway Container Registry for optimal integration. See the [migration guide](/serverless-jobs/api-cli/migrate-external-image-to-scaleway-registry/) for full details.

## Environment variables

An environment variable is a variable whose value is set outside the program, typically through functionality built into the operating system. An environment variable is made up of a name/value pair, and any number may be created and available for reference at a point in time.

## Ephemeral storage

In addition to CPU and RAM, Serverless Jobs also provide a storage volume for the duration of the task. This storage space allows to hold the data retrieved by the job, and disappears once the execution is complete.

## GB-s

Unit used to measure the resource consumption of a container. It reflects the amount of memory consumed over time.

## Job

Serverless Jobs is a fully managed solution that enables you to plan, schedule, queue and run batch processing workloads without worrying about provisioning and scaling. A job is a single instance of one of these batch processing workloads.

## Job definition

A Job definition is a template for a Serverless Job. It contains all the information necessary to run the job, including the container image used, the resources allocated, and the command to execute. The definition acts as a blueprint for [job runs](#job-run).

## Job name

The name of a job is part of the [job definition](#job-definition) and is used for informational purposes only.

## Job run

A job run is the execution of a job definition. It can be in a running, succeeded, canceled, or failed status. Each job run has a unique identifier and can be individually monitored using [Cockpit](/cockpit/quickstart/).

## Logging

Serverless offers a built-in logging system based on Scaleway Cockpit to track the activity of your resources: see [monitoring Serverless Jobs](/serverless-jobs/how-to/monitor-job/).

## Maximum duration

The maximum duration option allows you to define the maximum execution time before your job is automatically killed.

## Metrics

Performance metrics for your Serverless resources are natively available: see [monitoring Serverless Jobs](/serverless-jobs/how-to/monitor-job/).

## Private Networks compatibility

Refer to the [dedicated FAQ](/serverless-jobs/faq/#how-can-i-configure-access-to-a-private-network-or-virtual-private-cloud-vpc) for more information on Serverless Jobs compatibility with Private Networks and [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](/vpc/).

## Schedule (cron)

A schedule (cron) is a mechanism used to automatically start a Serverless Job at a specific time on a recurring schedule. It works similarly to a traditional Linux cron job, using the `* * * * *` format. Refer to our [cron schedules reference](/serverless-jobs/reference-content/cron-schedules/) for more information.

## Serverless Containers

Serverless Containers is a fully managed service that enables you to run containerized applications in a scalable and serverless environment.

It automatically handles infrastructure management, scaling, and load balancing, allowing you to focus on writing code without worrying about servers or clusters. Serverless Containers supports any language, framework, or binary that can run in a container, and it integrates seamlessly with other Scaleway services, making it ideal for deploying modern, event-driven, and API-based applications.

## Serverless Functions

Serverless Functions are fully managed compute services that allow you to run small, stateless code snippets or functions in response to HTTP requests or events.

These functions automatically scale based on demand and are designed to be lightweight, event-driven, and easily deployable, eliminating the need to worry about infrastructure management. Functions is built on top of Serverless Containers, meaning you can run your functions packaged in containers and have them scale efficiently.

## Serverless Jobs

Serverless Jobs are similar to Serverless Containers but are better suited for running longer workloads. See [the comparison between Serverless products](/serverless-jobs/reference-content/difference-jobs-functions-containers) for more information.

## Secrets reference

A secret reference is a mechanism that allows you to use a secret stored in [Secret Manager](/secret-manager/) within Serverless Jobs. It allows you to securely reference sensitive data, such as API secret keys, passwords, tokens, or certificates.

## Startup command

This optional field allows you to specify a custom command executed upon starting your job if your container image does not have one already, or if you use a public container image.

## Status

A Serverless Job run can have the following statuses:
* **Succeeded**: your Serverless Job run finished in a successful state.
* **Queued**: your Serverless Job run is waiting for resources to run.
* **Error**: your Serverless Job run finished with an error or timeout. [Check our troubleshooting documentation](/serverless-jobs/troubleshooting/job-in-error-state/) to solve the issue.
* **Canceled**: your Serverless Job run has been canceled by the user.

## Stateless

Refers to a system or application that does not maintain any persistent state between executions. In a stateless environment, each request or operation is independent, and no information is retained from previous interactions.

This means that each request is treated as a new and isolated event, and there is no need for the system to remember previous states or data once a task is completed. Statelessness is commonly used in serverless architectures where each function execution is independent of others.

To store data you can use [Scaleway Object Storage](/object-storage/), [Scaleway Managed Databases](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/), and [Scaleway Serverless Databases](/serverless-sql-databases/).

## Terraform/OpenTofu

Terraform/OpenTofu is an infrastructure-as-code tool, owned by Hashicorp. Serverless Jobs integrate easily with your infrastructure as code, via our [Terraform/OpenTofu provider and resources](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/scaleway/scaleway/latest/docs/resources/job_definition).

Examples using Terraform/OpenTofu can be found in our [Serverless Examples repository](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-examples), such as our [example using Terraform/OpenTofu with Serverless Jobs](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-examples/blob/main/jobs/terraform-hello-world).

## vCPU-s

Unit used to measure the resource consumption of a container. It reflects the amount of vCPU used over time.
