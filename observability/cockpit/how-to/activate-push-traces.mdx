This page shows you how to create [traces](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#traces) from the Scaleway console, retrieve traces push paths, configure the OpenTelemetry HTTP agent, and push traces.

<Macro id="requirements" />

  - A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## Create a trace

1. Click **Cockpit** in the Observability section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Cockpit** overview page displays.
2. Click the **Data sources** tab.
3. Click **+ Create external data sources**. A pop-up displays.
4. Complete the required steps to create your trace:
  - Enter a name
  - Choose the **Traces** data type
  - Select a region to create your trace in
5. Check the estimated cost, then click **Create external data source**.

### Retrieve traces push paths

<Message type="important">
 Only the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/what-is-opentelemetry/) HTTP push path is supported. Scaleway is working on implementing the [Open Telemetry gRPC](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/rpc/grpc/), [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/) and [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.50/) protocols.

Scaleway provides the following push path for the OpenTelemetry agent: `/otlp`.
The complete endpoint is `https://traces.cockpit.fr-par.scw.cloud/otlp`.

## Push traces

1. [Create a token](/observability/cockpit/how-to/create-token/) with **Push** permissions for traces.
    <Message type="important">
     Your token's secret key displays only once. Make sure that you copy and save it before you exit the page.
    </Message>
2. Configure your applications to send traces to your [preferred endpoint](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#endpoints) using your newly-created token to authenticate.
3. [Create your Grafana credentials](/observability/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/).
4. [Log in to your Grafana account](/observability/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards).
5. Create your [Grafana dashboard](/observability/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards) and start monitoring your data.

<Message type="note">
 Find out more information about pushing traces in the [official Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/panels-visualizations/visualizations/traces/#add-a-panel-with-tracing-visualizations).
