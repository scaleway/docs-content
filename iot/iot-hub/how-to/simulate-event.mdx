To demonstrate the use of Hub Events, the following tutorial allows you generate an error, and shows you how to receive this error.
For more information about Hub Events, you can check out the [IoT Hub events documentation](/iot/iot-hub/reference-content/hubs/#events).

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have [created an IoT Hub](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/create-hub)
- You have [installed `mosquitto`](https://mosquitto.org/download/) on your local computer

</Message>

1. Click **IoT Hub** in the **IoT Station** section of the side menu. The list of your IoT Hubs displays.

2. Click the name of the IoT Hub you want to configure. The hub's overview page displays.

3. Click **Devices** to display the device configuration.

4. Click **Add devices** in the devices tab. The **Create a Device** wizard displays.

5. Enter a name for the device (`logger`) and **allow** insecure connections.

6. Click **Add a Device to your Hub**. The devices details displays. Take a note of the **Device ID**:

7. Open a terminal window on your local computer and subscribe to the `$SCW/events/error/#` topic to receive the hub event:
	```
	mosquitto_sub -h iot.fr-par.scw.cloud -p 1883 -i <logger-device-id> -t '$SCW/events/error/#'
	```
	<Message type="note">

  	The Endpoint `iot-fr-par.scw.cloud` may vary, you find your endpoint on the Hub's network page.

	</Message>

	The command above contains the following elements:
	  - `-h`: The **endpoint** or host of your IoT Hub. You require it to communiciate with your hub.
	  - `-i`: The **device ID** of your device. You can retrieve it from the **Devices** section of your hub. 
	  - `-t`: The **thread** to send your meesage to. 
  	  - `-m`: The **message** containing the information you want to transmit.

8. Create a second *secured* device, named _secured device_ and **denying insecure** connections. 
	<Message type="note">

	This will be used to generate an mTLS error by using a device configured to `Deny Insecure` connections, and trying to connect with it.

	</Message>

9. Open a second terminal on your compter and connect the secured device to your Hub, but without using any security: 
	```
	mosquitto_pub -h iot.fr-par.scw.cloud -i secured-device-id -t foo/bar -m 'This wont work'
	``` 

10. Go back to the first terminal. The `logger` device will then receive a message having a topic that looks like `$SCW/events/error/device/<secured-device-id>`, and following payload:
	```
	{
		"time":"2020-01-17T15:01:29Z",
		"severity": "error",
		"object-type": "device",
		"object-id": "secured-device-id",
		"msg": "mutual TLS authentication is required",
		"packet":"CONNECT: dup: false qos: 0 retain: false rLength: 12"
	}
	```
