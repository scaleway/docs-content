| Volume type                   | IOPS | Underlying hardware         | Latency         | Max volume size | Recommended use cases | Availability & resilience |
|-----------------------------------|----------|--------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| `b_ssd` (Block Storage legacy) | 5,000    | Legacy SSDs                    | High              | Up to 10 TB          | General-purpose workloads that do not demand high IOPS    | Data is replicated three times across multiple disks for high availability and integrity |
| `sbs_5k` (Block 5K)   | 5,000    | Modern NVMe disks               | Low                 | 5 GB to 10 TB        | Development environments, web servers, and applications needing consistent performance | 99.99% SLA, triple-replicated data to safeguard against hardware failures |
| `sbs_15k` (Block 15K) | 15,000   | Modern NVMe disks               | Very low           | 5 GB to 10 TB        | High-performance databases, transactional applications, and I/O-intensive workloads | 99.99% SLA, triple-replicated data to safeguard against hardware failures |
