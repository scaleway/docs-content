## Transmit 5 - Overview

Object Storage allows you to store any kind of object (documents, images, videos, etc.) and retrieve them at a later time from anywhere.

For instance, you can store images and they will be accessible using HTTPS.
You can use the control panel to manage your storage. Some tools exist to interact with Object Storage.

    - **Address:** `s3.REGION.scw.cloud`
    - **Port:** `443`
    - **Access key ID:** your Access key
    - **Secret:** your Secret key
    - **Root URL:** `https://s3.REGION.scw.cloud`

    <Message type="important">
      Edit the **Address** and **Root URL** parameters to the region of your bucket. It can either be `fr-par` (Paris, France), `nl-ams` (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) or `pl-waw`(Warsaw, Poland).
