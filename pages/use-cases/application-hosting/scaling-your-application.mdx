Scaleway offers scalable and secure hosting solutions to support your app development and deployment. Whether you're building a small prototype or a full-scale enterprise application, we have the resources you need.

Choosing the right hosting strategy is key to ensuring performance, scalability, and maintainability. Below are best practices and guidelines to help you scale your application effectively using Scaleway products.

## Choose the Right Hosting Model for Your Use Case

Different applications have different requirements in terms of scalability, control, and operational complexity. Consider the following deployment options based on your application’s needs:

| Deployment Method               | Best For                                                  | Scalability | Management Overhead |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Serverless Containers**        | Dynamic web apps, APIs, microservices                      | High        | Low                 |
| **Instances**                    | Full control, long-running workloads, custom configurations | Medium      | High                |
| **Elastic Metal (Aluminium)**    | High-performance, predictable workloads, low-latency apps  | High        | High                |
| **Kubernetes Kapsule**           | High-performance, high availability, low-latency apps      | High        | High                |
| **Object Storage + Edge Services** | Static websites, frontend assets, serverless front-ends     | High     | Very Low            |

For most modern web applications, we recommend starting with **Serverless Containers** or **Instances** depending on whether you prefer abstraction over infrastructure or full control.

## Best Practices for Scaling Applications

### Use Auto-Scaling Where Possible
When deploying with **Serverless Containers**, your application automatically scales to zero when idle and scales out under load, optimizing cost and performance. This is ideal for variable or unpredictable traffic.

<Message type="tip">
Structure your app to be stateless and rely on external services (like Managed Databases for PostgreSQL and MySQL or Object Storage) for persistence to make scaling seamless.
</Message>

### Leverage Edge Services for Global Performance
Pair your application with **Scaleway Edge Services** to cache responses at the edge, reducing latency and backend load. This is especially effective for content-heavy or globally accessed applications.

<Message type="tip">
Use Edge TLS pipelines to secure and accelerate traffic to your app or static assets.
</Message>

### Separate Concerns: Frontend and Backend
Deploy frontend and backend components independently:
- Host static frontends (React, Vue, etc.) on **Object Storage** with **Edge** for fast global delivery.
- Run backend APIs in **Serverless Containers** or **Instances** for dynamic processing.

<Message type="tip">
Independent scaling, faster iteration, and improved security.
</Message>

### Automate Deployment and CI/CD
Use Scaleway Container Registry and integrate with your CI/CD pipeline to automate image building and deployment. This ensures consistent, repeatable deployments.

<Message type="tip">
Tag your container images semantically and use deployment hooks to minimize downtime.
</Message>

### Monitor and Optimize
Use monitoring tools to track CPU, memory, and request metrics. Scaleway provides integration points for observability solutions.

<Message type="tip">
Set up alerts for high load or error rates to proactively manage performance.
</Message>

### Secure Your Application
- Always enable HTTPS using **Edge Services** or load balancers.
- Use private networks and security groups to restrict access to backends and databases.
- Regularly update and patch your environments, especially on **Instances** and **Elastic Metal**.
