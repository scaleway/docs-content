## What is the account linking process for?

The linking process is available to help you link your Dedibox (Online.net) and Scaleway accounts.<br />
Once the process is complete, you will be able to manage your Dedibox Servers and associated services from the Scaleway console, as well as from the existing console.online.net console.

## What happens during the account linking process?

During the process, your Dedibox account is linked to your Scaleway account so that you can find all your Dedibox servers in the [new console](https://console.scaleway.com).<br />
When you don't have a Scaleway account, the process allows you to create a Scaleway account from your Dedibox information. This allows you to find all of your Dedibox servers in the new console and enjoy a new experience.

## What are the time constraints for linking accounts?

Accounts are linked at the user's request. You can launch the process at any time from the link provided in the email invitation.

## Is account linking free?

Yes. The link of your Dedibox account to the Scaleway console is completely free of charge.

## How long does the account linking process take?

The account linking process takes about 5 minutes. This is the time required to review all of your account information.

## To which Scaleway Organization can I link my Dedibox?

If you already have a Scaleway account, you must be the Owner of the [Organization](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#organization) you would like to link your Dedibox account to.
You should also make sure that this Organization has the same country as your Dedibox account.  If it's not the case, you should create a new account, or [contact our support team](/console/my-account/how-to/open-a-support-ticket/) to change the country.

## Are my other Online.net services (web hosting, domains, Dedirack, etc.) linked to my Scaleway account during the process?

No. The other Online.net services will not be linked at this stage but will remain accessible in the Dedibox console.

## Is there date when the Dedibox console (console.online.net) will stop being available?

No. The current Dedibox console will remain accessible.

## Will the new console replace the current one?

Some operations are not yet available in the Scaleway console but you will soon be able to do everything you need.<br />
In the meantime, the Dedibox console and all the Dedibox server management features remain available after the account link.

## Can I still use the Dedibox console after the upgrade?

Yes, you can continue to use the Dedibox console to manage all other Online.net services, as well as your Dedibox servers.

## What is the current functional coverage of Dedibox in the Scaleway console?

## What information is synchronized between the two consoles?

We will synchronize your personal information (first name, last name, email address, phone number) and billing information (address, company name - if any, VAT number - if any, billing contact) between Scaleway and Dedibox.<br />
Once linked, you will be able to edit this information from the Scaleway console only.

<Message type="important">

  Once you have linked your account, you can edit your payment information from the Scaleway console only. You will not be able to edit the payment information from the Dedibox console anymore.

</Message>

## Will I have a single login in the future?

In the future, you may only need to use your Scaleway login information to connect to the Scaleway console and to manage all your Scaleway products. 

## What impact will linking accounts have on my billing?

You will continue to receive an invoice for each type of product (one for Scaleway Dedibox and one for Scaleway Cloud products).
However, it is the payment method defined in your Scaleway console that will allow you to pay all your Scaleway invoices (Scaleway Dedibox and Scaleway Cloud). It is thus important that following the linking process, you verify whether the default payment method defined in the Scaleway console is your preferred payment method for future invoices.<br />

## Where can I find my Dedibox invoices, following the linking of my accounts?

You will be able to find all your invoices in the Billing section of the Scaleway console (old Dedibox invoices as well as all new invoices).

## Following the linking of my accounts, will I find my Dedibox payment methods in the Scaleway console?

All your active Dedibox payment methods will be migrated to the new console during the linking process so that you will be able to manage them from the Scaleway console instead of the Dedibox console.<br />
You have to choose a unique default payment method for your Scaleway services. This default payment method allows you to pay all of your Scaleway invoices (Scaleway Cloud and Scaleway Dedibox).<br />
The definition of your default payment method follows these rules:
* If you have SEPA as your preferred payment method in either your Dedibox or Scaleway Cloud account, this SEPA then becomes the default payment method for both your Scaleway Cloud and Scaleway Dedibox invoices.
* If you do not have a SEPA as your preferred payment method in either account, the preferred payment method of credit card remains the same for both Scaleway Cloud and Scaleway Dedibox invoices.
* If you use different credit cards for Dedibox and Scaleway Cloud, the card registered with Scaleway Cloud becomes the default payment method for both Scaleway Cloud and Scaleway Dedibox invoices.

<Message type="tip">
  Once account linking has been completed, you can modify your payment method in the [billing section](https://console.scaleway.com/organization/billing) of the Scaleway console. All existing default payment methods will be transferred to your linked account.
</Message>


## Will the current Dedibox API system continue to work?

Yes, the API system is not impacted by account linking.


## What are the terms of the voucher offered for the migration?
The first customers to follow the linking process will be granted a discount of 100€. This discount is directly applied to the Scaleway account and is valid for six months following the linking process. It is available on Scaleway cloud services ordered through the Scaleway console and does not include Dedibox and Elastic Metal products.
