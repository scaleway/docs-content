When creating volumes from the Scaleway console, you are prompted to choose between [Block Storage Low Latency](/storage/block/) volumes, [block volumes (Block Storage)](/compute/instances/concepts/#block-volumes), and [local volumes (Local Storage)](/compute/instances/concepts/#volumes).

This page provides information about the differences between Block Storage and Block Storage Low Latency 5K [IOPS](/storage/block/concepts/#iops) volumes.

Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/compute/instances/concepts/#volumes) to learn about the differences between Block Storage and local storage volumes.


## Underlying hardware

   - **Block Storage 5K IOPS volumes**:

     - They are built using older-generation SSDs. This means that the hardware is slower, as it uses older SSD technology.
     - The 5K IOPS is split between read and write operations, resulting in a total of 10K IOPS (5K for reads and 5K for writes).

   - **Block Storage Low Latency 5K IOPS volumes**:

     - They are powered by modern NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) disks.
     - NVMe technology provides better performance and is optimized for high-speed storage operations.

## Performance

   - **Block Storage 5K IOPS volumes**:

     - Their performance is limited by the older SSD hardware, which can result in slower data access and higher latency.
     - The older technology may impact overall speed and responsiveness.

   - **Block Storage Low Latency 5K IOPS volumes**:

     - Delivers better performance thanks to NVMe disks, which handle 5K IOPS for both read and write operations combined.
     - This provides a significant boost in data processing speed and efficiency.

## Latency

   - **Block Storage 5K IOPS volumes**:

     - Higher latency due to the use of older SSDs.
     - This can lead to slower application response times, especially in scenarios requiring rapid data access.

   - **Block Storage Low Latency 5K IOPS volumes**:

     - Offers lower latency and faster access times, making it ideal for applications that require quick data retrieval.
     - The use of NVMe technology ensures a smoother and more responsive experience.


## Summary

- **Block Storage 5K IOPS volumes** rely on older, slower SSD technology, leading to higher latency and lower overall performance.

- **Block Storage Low Latency 5K IOPS volumes** use advanced NVMe disks, offering improved performance, lower latency, and faster data access.

For tasks where performance and low latency are crucial, Block Storage Low Latency volumes provide a more effective solution due to the modern hardware and technological improvements.
