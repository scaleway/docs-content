This page provides information on what to do if you cannot find any events in Audit Trail.


## Problem

I cannot see any events in Audit Trail.

## Possible solutions

- Make sure that you have the [permision set necessary to access Audit Trail](/audit-trail/how-to/configure-audit-trail-permissions). If you are not an IAM manager, contact your IAM manager to ask for Audit Trail access.

- Make sure you have created Scaleway resources to see events in Audit Trail.

- Make sure that the events you are looking for are from Scaleway resources that are integrated with Audit Trail.

- Make sure that you are looking for the desired events in the **right** region. Switch regions in the **Region** drop-down and look for the desired events again.
