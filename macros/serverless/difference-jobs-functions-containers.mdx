## Differences between Functions, Containers, and Jobs

### Considerations

* **Serverless Containers** offers more flexibility by allowing you to deploy any containerized application. It's suitable for stateless services and can handle more complex applications with configurable concurrency and no maximum execution time.
* **Serverless Functions** is ideal for lightweight, event-driven code where you don't manage the underlying infrastructure. It's limited to specific languages and is not suitable for long-running processes.
* **Serverless Jobs** is designed for executing batch jobs or tasks that need to run to completion. It is ideal for data processing tasks, migrations, or any workload that doesn't fit the request-response model.

## Details

### Serverless Jobs

Serverless Jobs are designed for batch computing workloads, particularly large-scale and asynchronous tasks, like data processing, image rendering, or complex computations.

Choose Scaleway [Serverless Jobs](/serverless/jobs/quickstart/):

- For long-running tasks and resource-intensive applications.
- To handle numerous jobs concurrently.
- If you do not need to expose your service on a port.
- For asynchronous processing.

<Message type="note">
  To run as a Serverless Job, your applications must be containerized, which offers you a lot of choice when configuring your runtime environments.
</Message>

### Serverless Functions

Choose Scaleway [Serverless Functions](/serverless/functions/quickstart/):

- For stateless and short-lived workloads (< 15 minutes).
- For event-driven tasks.
- For optimum performance in lightweight scenarios.
- For autoscaling applications.
- For web-facing applications and web servers.

<Message type="note">
  Serverless Functions can only be written in languages [available as runtimes](/serverless/functions/reference-content/functions-lifecycle/#available-runtimes).
</Message>

### Serverless Containers

Choose Scaleway [Serverless Containers](/serverless/containers/quickstart/):

- For stateless, short-lived applications (< 15 minutes).
- For event-driven tasks.
- If your programming language is not supported as a Serverless Function runtime.
- For autoscaling workloads.
