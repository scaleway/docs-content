## Datalab

It is a project object grouping the Notebook and the Spark Cluster. The usage of the datalab are yet to be defined API-Wise.

## Distributed Data Lab

A data lab that is distributed.

## fixture

A set of data forming a request used for testing.

## JupyterLab 

It is the current type of Notebook we provide at this stage of project. Others types of Notebooks exist, but are not offered yet by our service. Form more information, view Jupyter documentation.

## Kubernetes Cluster

A set of machines called nodes orchestrated by a control plane node. On every node is deployed architectural components such as services, pods, ingress rules, etc... Those components together form resources that can be consumed by other services. In the case of this project, consumption is used for big data calculus. For more information, view Kubernetes documentation.

## Lighter

It is a technology that allows to make the SparkMagic commands readable/executable for the Spark Cluster. For more information, view Lighter repository.

## Notebook

It is the environment of development used to write and deploy distributed calculus over a Spark Cluster.

## Spark Cluster 

It is an orchestrated set of machines over which the distributed/Big data calculus is going to be processed. In the case of this project, the Spark Cluster is a Kubernetes Cluster, upon which spark has been installed in every pod deployed. For more information, view Spark documentation.

## SparkMagic

It is a set of tools for interactively working with remote Spark clusters in Jupyter Notebooks. For more information, view SparkMagic repository.

## Transaction

An SQL operation than can be rolled back if an error occurs.
