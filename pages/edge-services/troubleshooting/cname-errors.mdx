When setting up your customized subdomain with Edge Services, you have the option to carry out a verification check on the CNAME record (if your domain is managed with an external provider). Edge Services will query the subdomain and check that it resolves correctly to the Edge Services endpoint. If there is a problem, you will see an error message: 

    <Lightbox image={image} alt="A screenshot of the Edge Services dashboard in the Scaleway console. An error shows: No CNAME record found. Create a CNAME record for davideo.videos.com pointing to davideo.svc.edge.scw.cloud" />

An error message may also display at a later point from your Edge Services dashboard if a problem is detected at any point with your CNAME record or subdomain:

    <Lightbox image={image2} alt="A screenshot of the Edge Services dashboard in the Scaleway console. The DNS status light is yellow, with the text: No CNAME" />

The table below helps you resolve these errors:

| Error message                             | Solution                                                            |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No CNAME record found                     | Make sure you have created a valid DNS record of type **CNAME** (not **A**, **AAAA** or another type), where your subdomain points to the Edge Services endpoint.  |
| Incorrect CNAME                           | Make sure your CNAME record points to the Edge Services endpoint in the format `pipeline-id.svc.edge.scw.cloud.`, and that you have replaced `pipeline-id` with the ID of your bucket or Load Balancer's Edge Services pipeline.        |
| Domain does not exist                     | You must own the domain name you are attempting to configure. If you do not already own the domain name, you cannot create a subdomain or CNAME record for it. Register the domain name, for example using our [Domains and DNS](/domains-and-dns/how-to/register-internal-domain/) product, then create a CNAME record for the subdomain. Otherwise, ensure you did not make a typo when entering the domain name into the Scaleway console.                     |
| scw.cloud is forbidden                    | You cannot use subdomains of the `scw.cloud` domain, as the domain is owned and managed by Scaleway and you cannot create DNS records for it. Use your own domain and subdomain.                   |
| Invalid Top Level Domain                  | Make sure the Top-Level Domain (e.g. `.com`, `.fr`) you entered is correct.                    |
| Root domain not allowed                   | You cannot use a root domain alone to customize Edge Services (e.g. `example.com`. Make sure you use a subdomain (e.g. `blog.example.com`))                   |                                          |
| Subdomain must be a correctly-formatted, fully-qualified subdomain name  | Make sure the subdomain name you entered is [correctly formatted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name#Domain_name_syntax), e.g. `foo.example.fr`.   |
| Record already exists for this FQDN in your DNS zone  | Choose a different subdomain, or delete the existing DNS record.   |

Note that if your domain is managed by Scaleway Domains and DNS and you therefore have an auto-created CNAME record, you should **not** attempt to delete it or modify it in any way. Scaleway will take care of deleting the CNAME record if and when you deactivate Edge Services.
