Audit logs are enabled by default for Kubernetes clusters with [dedicated control planes](/containers/kubernetes/reference-content/kubernetes-control-plane-offers/). 

For security and compliance, audit logging allows to keep a chronological record of calls made to the Kubernetes API server, investigate suspicious API requests, collect statistics, or create monitoring alerts for unwanted API calls. 

All audit logs are centralized in Cockpit for free.
