Scaleway Elements is a complete cloud ecosystem, offering a single way for you to create, deploy and scale your infrastructure in the cloud. Create your Scaleway Elements account to gain access to the [Scaleway Console](/console/my-account/concepts#console) and [Scaleway API](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/), and deploy our products and services with ease.

1. Open the [Scaleway website](https://www.scaleway.com/en/elements/) in a web browser.

3. Select an account type (**Personal** or **Corporate**) and fill out your first and last name, as well as your e-mail address.

4. Check the box and solve the [reCaptcha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReCAPTCHA) if you would like to receive marketing communications from Scaleway. Then, click **Get Started!** to create your account. A message displays to request that you check your e-mail inbox for the verification e-mail.

5. Click the verification link in your mailbox to confirm your email address and agree to our terms of service. You are redirected to the Scaleway Console. A welcome message displays.

  You are asked to select between three account levels:
  
    - **Discover:** allows you to browse through the Scaleway console and discover the catalog without ordering.
    - **Test:** allows you to order a few resources and test them before starting development or production.
    - **Build:** allows you to order any type of resources and scale your project as it grows.
