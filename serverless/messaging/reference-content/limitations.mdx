## Usage limits

For the usage limits that apply when using Scaleway NATS, Queues, and Topics and Events, see the dedicated sections on our [Organization quotas](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/additional-content/organization-quotas/) page. Limits (quotas) apply to, for example, the maximum number of queues, streams, topics and consumers/subscribers, as well as to message retention duration and storage.

## VPC

NATS, Queues, and Topics and Events are not currently compatible with [Scaleway VPC](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/network/vpc/quickstart/).
