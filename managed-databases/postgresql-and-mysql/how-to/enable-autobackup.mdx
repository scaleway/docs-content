With the autobackup feature, the creation and management of your Database Instance backups is automated according to your backup schedule configuration.

Two types of autobackups are available at Scaleway: [backups](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/concepts/#database-backup) and [snapshots](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/concepts/#database-snapshot).

Backups are used when your Database Instance's storage option is a local volume. Snapshots are available for Database Instances that use [Basic](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/concepts/#basic-block-storage) and [Low Latency](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/concepts/#block-storage-low-latency) Block Storage volumes.

<Message type="important">
  Although they bear the same feature name, automated snapshots and automated backups are different in their design. If you have a Database Instance using Block Storage, it is only possible to use automated snapshots as autobackup.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [PostgreSQL or MySQL Database Instance](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/quickstart)

<Message type="note">
  The autobackup feature is enabled by default upon the creation of an Instance. Simultaneously, a schedule policy is created. The default autobackup frequency is of 1 per day with a retention period of 7 days. You can change this in the Database Instance information page after Instance creation.
  <br /><br />
  By default, the Database Instance creation date is used as the base timestamp for the automated backups. When you change the schedule configuration, the moment you validated the new configuration becomes the new base timestamp. For example, if at 8 a.m. on a Thursday you update the autobackup frequency to 24h, your next autobackup will be created at 8 a.m. on a Friday.

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the Database Instance name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance's Overview page.
    <Message type="note">
      If you have a Database Instance using Block Storage, you can follow the next steps from the **Snapshots** tab.
    </Message>
3. Scroll down to **Backup configuration** and click <Icon name="edit" />.
    <Message type="note">
      Although autobackup is enabled by default, you can select **Manual** in the **Choose a backup configuration** step of the Database Instance creation wizard to disable the feature before you create the Instance. You can also disable it after the Database Instance is ready.

4. Configure the backup frequency and retention, then click <Icon name="validate" /> to confirm.

You can follow our documentation to [restore](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/manage-manual-backups/#how-to-restore-backups) and [export](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/manage-manual-backups/#how-to-export-backups) your backups.

For snapshots, you can follow the [how to restore snapshots](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/manage-snapshots/#how-to-create-a-database-instance-from-a-snapshot) procedure to create a Database Instance from a snapshot.
