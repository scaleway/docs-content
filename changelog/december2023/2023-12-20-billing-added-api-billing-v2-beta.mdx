Hello folks, 

We are pleased to introduce the new beta version of Billing API v2 beta 1

Scaleway's Billing API gives you an overview of your cloud consumption and allows you to monitor expenses.

What's New?

- Monthly Consumption History: Now, access the complete history of your monthly consumption. Until now, only data from the current month was available.

- Granularity of Costs by Project, Product Category, and Month: We've introduced increased granularity, allowing you to view costs based on the project, product category, and month.
