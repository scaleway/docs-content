Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.
It synchronizes application definitions from a Git repository, ensuring that the desired state of applications is maintained across clusters. 
Designed for high scalability and automation, Argo CD supports multi-cluster deployments, automated rollbacks, and advanced RBAC policies.
This makes it ideal for managing complex Kubernetes environments with precision and reliability.


<Macro id="requirements" />
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner/) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission/) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
- Created a Scaleway Kubernetes [Kapsule](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/) or [Kosmos](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-kosmos-cluster/) cluster

## Deploying the Argo CD application using Easy Deploy

<Message type="important">
When configuring your Kubernetes cluster, note that certain applications and services, such as Argo CD, may result in additional resources being provisioned.
For example, your YAML configuration might create Block Storage volumes or Load Balancers, which could incur extra costs.
</Message>


1. In the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/), navigate to the **Kubernetes** section under **Containers**.
2. Click the name of the cluster where you wish to deploy Argo CD. The **Cluster Information** tab will display.
3. Click the **Easy Deploy** tab. The application dashboard displays.
4. Click **Deploy Application**. The application deployment wizard displays.
5. Choose **Application Library** to see the list of available applications.
6. Select the **Argo CD** application.
    <Message type="tip">
       If you cannot find Argo CD on the first page, use the search bar or navigate through the library.
    </Message>
7. Optionally, customize the default configuration for Argo CD using [Helm Charts](/tutorials/kubernetes-package-management-helm/). If you do not need any customized configuration you can skip this step.
8. Enter a name (e.g. `argocd`) and a Kubernetes namespace for your application. If no name is entered, Argo CD will be installed in the default namespace of the cluster.
9. Click **Deploy Application** to deploy Argo CD on your Kubernetes cluster.

## Retrieving the Argo CD admin password

1. Access the [Kubernetes Dashboard](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/access-kubernetes-dashboard/) of your cluster and navigate to **Secrets** under the **Config and Storage** section.
2. Click `argocd-initial-admin-secret` to display the application metadata information.
3. Click the "eye" icon next to `password` to reveal the Argo CD admin password. Copy the password.

## Connecting to Argo CD

Argo CD uses a LoadBalancer to manage traffic. To check the deployment status, run:

```
$ kubectl get svc
NAME                               TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)                      AGE
argocd-applicationset-controller   ClusterIP      10.39.101.19    <none>           7000/TCP                     5m40s
argocd-dex-server                  ClusterIP      10.36.208.223   <none>           5556/TCP,5557/TCP            5m40s
argocd-redis                       ClusterIP      10.34.58.107    <none>           6379/TCP                     5m40s
argocd-repo-server                 ClusterIP      10.35.236.175   <none>           8081/TCP                     5m40s
argocd-server                      LoadBalancer   10.39.250.191   195.154.xx.yyy   80:30372/TCP,443:32468/TCP   5m40s
kubernetes                         ClusterIP      10.32.0.1       <none>           443/TCP                      55m
```

Once the external IP status changes from `<PENDING>` to the assigned external IP, your Argo CD application is up. Copy the IP address and paste it into a web browser. The Argo CD login screen will appear.

## Logging into Argo CD

1. Paste the external IP address of the LoadBalancer service into your web browser to open the Argo CD login screen.
2. Enter **admin** as the username and the password retrieved in the previous step to log in.
