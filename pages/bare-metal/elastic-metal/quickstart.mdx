Scaleway Elastic Metal are dedicated physical servers you can order on-demand, like Instances. These servers are ideal for large workloads, big data, and applications that require increased security and dedicated resources. You can install an OS or other [image](/elastic-metal/concepts/#image) on your Elastic Metal server and connect to it via SSH to use it as you require. You can power off the server when you are not using or delete it from your account once you have finished with it.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)

## How to create an Elastic Metal server

1. Go to **Elastic Metal** in the **Bare Metal** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Elastic Metal server creation page displays.
2. Click **Create Elastic Metal server**. The server creation wizard will launch.
3. Complete the server creation wizard:
    - Select the geographical region for your server by choosing an Availability Zone.

    - Enter a name and, optionally, add tags to identify your server.
    - Add your SSH key (required if installing an image on your server). Depending on the OS image, you may also be asked to configure the panel user for your server.

    - Optionally, decide whether to enable the Private Networks feature. [Learn more about Private Networks](/vpc/concepts/#private-networks)
    - Review the estimated environmental footprint of your Elastic Metal server.
