## How to create a member

1. Click **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** from the top-right of your [Organization Dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) in the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) displays.
2. Click **+ Create member**. A pop-up displays.
3. Enter a username and the email address of the member you want to add to your Organization.
    <Message type="important">
      When you create a member, a Scaleway account is created for them. They exist only within your Organization. If you delete the member, their account is also deleted.
    </Message>
4. Check the box if you want to send a welcome email to the member.
5. Add a password.
    <Message type="note">
      This step is optional. If you set a password, make sure you keep note of it to share it with the member later. The password will only be shown once. From their first login, the member has up to seven days to update their password and comply with this security requirement.
    </Message>
6. Click **Create member**.

If you did not send an invitation email to the member, make sure you give them their log in information.
