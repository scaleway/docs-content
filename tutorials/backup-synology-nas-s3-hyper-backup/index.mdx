[Synology Hyper Backup](https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/feature/hyper_backup) is a solution to back up your Synology NAS easily on Scaleway Object Storage.

A NAS is a network-connected device housing one or several hard disks to store all your photos, music, videos, and other data. The device sits in your home network. With different access rights, you can grant access to anyone in your network or make your files available by sharing them over your internet connection.

As the NAS holds huge amounts of your personal data, a good backup strategy is important. Synology has developed an application called Hyper Backup which allows automatizing the backup of their NAS devices on several external media. These media include external devices, another Synology NAS, a rsync server, or a public cloud service like [Scaleway Object Storage](https://www.scaleway.com/en/object-storage/).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/quickstart/)
- A NAS device supporting [Synology Hyper Backup](https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/feature/hyper_backup)

## Configuring Hyper Backup

    - **Server address**: The address of the Object Storage endpoint<br />
      It can be either 
        - `s3.fr-par.scw.cloud` for buckets in Paris
        - `s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud` for buckets in Amsterdam
        - `s3.pl-waw.scw.cloud` for buckets in Warsaw.
    - **Signature version**: Choose the value `v2` from the drop-down list
    - **Access key**: The `access key` of your [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
    - **Secret key**: The `secret key` of your [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
    - **Bucket name**: Choose the bucket for storing your backups from the drop-down list
    - **Directory**: The name of the directory for storing your backups. A default name is being generated from the name of your Synology device. That name can be changed if required.
