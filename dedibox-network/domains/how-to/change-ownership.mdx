You must always keep the contact details relating to the owner of your domain name accurate and up to date. This can be done by [following the instructions here](/dedibox-network/domains/how-to/file-contact-info). However, if you wish to change details pertaining to the identity of the owner (full name(s) of a natural person or corporate name for a legal entity), this must be done by the change of ownership process described below.

Before changing the ownership of the domain, you must [ensure that all contact email addresses of the domain are up to date.](#how-to-check-and-update-the-contact-email)

</Message>

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net) 
  - You have a domain registered with Scaleway, which you want to transfer to a new owner
  - The new owner of the domain has [created a Dedibox account](/dedibox-console/account/how-to/create-a-dedibox-account/)

6. Create a handle for the new owner, containing all their contact details, and click **Confirm**.
7. Confirm the ownership trade and pay the administrative fee.
8. For the extensions `.fr`, `.eu` and `.be`, emails will be sent to both the old and new owners of the domain. Both parties are required to validate the trade by clicking the enclosed link. Without this action, the change of ownership will not be validated. 
  <Message type="important">
    Upon receipt of the email containing the validation link, you have one month to use it. To get a new validation link you will need to restart the change of ownership process. A new administrative fee will be applied.
  </Message>
  For the extensions `.com`, `.net` and `.org`, the validation is done directly once your change of ownership request is confirmed.
To verify that the change of ownership has been successfully carried out, you can use [http://who.is/](http://who.is/).
