Role-based access control (RBAC) is a native feature of Kubernetes and a method of regulating access to compute or network resources based on the roles of individual users within your Organization.
The feature is activated on Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule and Kosmos by default and is compatible with Scaleway's Identity and Access Management (IAM) service.
IAM and RBAC work together by integrating Scaleway’s IAM with Kubernetes' native RBAC system. This integration ensures that access permissions are consistent across both the cloud infrastructure and the Kubernetes cluster, providing a secure access control mechanism.
It allows you to assign roles to users, groups or `ServicesAccount` via `RoleBindings` and `ClusterRoleBindings`.

Key components of RBAC in Kubernetes include:

- **Roles and ClusterRoles:**
   - `Roles`: These are specific to a namespace, and define a set of permissions for resources within that namespace (e.g., Pods, Services).
   - `ClusterRoles`: These are similar to roles but apply cluster-wide, spanning all namespaces.
- **RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings:**
   - `RoleBindings`: These associate a set of permissions defined in a role with a user, group, or service account within a specific namespace.
   - `ClusterRoleBindings`: These associate a set of permissions defined in a ClusterRole with a user, group, or service account across the entire cluster.
- **Subjects:**  A subject in RBAC can be a user, a group, or a service account to which roles or cluster roles are bound.
- **Rules:** Rules are sets of permissions associated with roles or cluster roles. They specify what actions are allowed or denied on specific resources.

RBAC works seamlessly with Scaleway's IAM (Identity and Access Management) system. [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](/iam/concepts/#iam) provides control over resource access. IAM policies enable the configuration of permissions for Kubernetes Kapsule clusters at the Project level.

An [IAM policy](/iam/concepts/#policy) defines the permissions for users, groups, and applications within an Organization. It consists of a [principal](/iam/concepts/#principal) (the user, group, or application to which it applies) and IAM rules that specify permission sets and their scope.

The combination of IAM and Kubernetes RBAC allows you to define fine-grained access levels for cluster users.

### Configuring an IAM policy

To create a new policy with the correct permission sets using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/), follow these steps:

1. **Create a new policy**: Navigate to the **Policies** tab in your Organization’s IAM console and [create a new policy](/iam/how-to/create-policy/).
2. **Add your user (or group/application)**: Assign your user, group, or application as the **Principal**.
3. **Add an IAM rule**:
   - **Scope**: Set to **Access to resources** and specify the desired Project(s).
   - **Permission Sets**: Include the following, as needed:
     - `KubernetesFullAccess` for full cluster management.
     - `KubernetesReadOnly` for read-only access.
4. Click **Validate** and then **Create Policy**.
  <Message type="tip">
    - Refer to our [policy and permission sets documentation](/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/) for more details.
    - Scaleway may **automatically generate IAM resources**, such as applications, groups and policies. Refer to [auto-generated IAM resources](/iam/reference-content/auto-generated-iam-resources/) for further information.

### Mapping IAM permission sets to Kubernetes groups

The following IAM permission sets are mapped to Kubernetes groups:

| IAM permission set             | Kubernetes group            | Notes                    |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| `KubernetesFullAccess`           | `scaleway:cluster-write`      |                          |
|                                  | `scaleway:cluster-read`       |                          |
| `KubernetesReadOnly`             | `scaleway:cluster-read`       |                          |
| `KubernetesSystemMastersGroupAccess` | `system:masters`            | Super-user access to perform any action on any Kubernetes resource, ignoring all RBAC rules                 |

### Default ClusterRoleBindings

Default `ClusterRoleBinding` and `ClusterRole` configurations have been set up:

| Group                          | ClusterRoleBinding          | ClusterRole              |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| `scaleway:cluster-write`         | `scaleway:cluster-write`      | `scaleway:cluster-write`   |
| `scaleway:cluster-read`          | `scaleway:cluster-read`       | `scaleway:cluster-read`    |

These groups can be edited and will not be reconciled by Kapsule/Kosmos. If these roles are misconfigured and cut off access to the cluster, the IAM permission set `KubernetesSystemMastersGroupAccess` should be assigned to the application or user. This permission set allows bypassing the entire RBAC layer.

Users or applications can be added to zero, one, or more IAM groups. IAM groups are mapped to Kubernetes groups in the format `scaleway:groups:GROUPID`.

**Example:**

```bash
$ kubectl auth whoami
ATTRIBUTE   VALUE
Username    scaleway:bearer:de60e2b8-d590-4770-94bc-93b639382fb5
UID         de60e2b8-d590-4770-94bc-93b639382fb5
Groups      [scaleway:group:55eb7ac5-9afe-4e40-8d54-4fbb232cac21 scaleway:cluster-read system:authenticated]
```

## Creating a developers group with write access to dev and staging namespaces

1. Create an [IAM group](/iam/how-to/create-group/) called `developers`:
   - Assign the `KubernetesReadOnly` permission set to this group.
   - Note the group ID, as it will be needed later.

2. Create namespaces and roles:
   As a user or application with `KubernetesFullAccess` or `KubernetesSystemMastersGroupAccess`, create the following manifests:

    Namespace creation:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      name: dev
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      name: staging
    ```

    Role creation for dev namespace:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Role
    metadata:
      name: developers
      namespace: dev
    rules:
    - apiGroups: ["*"]
      resources: ["*"]
      verbs: ["*"]
    - nonResourceURLs: ["*"]
      verbs: ["*"]
    ```

    RoleBinding Creation for dev namespace:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: RoleBinding
    metadata:
      name: developers
      namespace: dev
    subjects:
    - kind: Group
      name: scaleway:groups:<GROUP_ID>
    roleRef:
      kind: Role
      name: developers
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    ```

    Repeat the same operation for the staging namespace.

3. Apply the manifests:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f filename.yaml
    ```

After these steps, members of the IAM group will have read access to the cluster and write access to the `dev` and `staging` namespaces. Permissions can be refined by modifying the `Role`.

## Assigning permissions to a specific user without using a group

1. Assign the `KubernetesReadOnly` permission set to the user.
2. Retrieve the **IAM user ID** and note it.
3. Create the following manifests:

    Namespace creation:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      name: demo-sandbox
    ```

    Role creation for an example namespace:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Role
    metadata:
      name: example
      namespace: example-sandbox
    rules:
    - apiGroups: ["*"]
      resources: ["*"]
      verbs: ["*"]
    - nonResourceURLs: ["*"]
      verbs: ["*"]
    ```

    RoleBinding creation for the example namespace:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: RoleBinding
    metadata:
      name: example
      namespace: example-sandbox
    subjects:
    - kind: User
      name: scaleway:bearer:<USER_ID>
    roleRef:
      kind: Role
      name: demo
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    ```

4. Apply the manifests:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f filename.yaml
    ```

    The user "demo" now has full rights in the `example-sandbox` namespace.

## Limiting cluster-read access

To modify the `scaleway:cluster-read` permissions, use the following command:

```bash
kubectl edit clusterrole scaleway:cluster-read
```
