Outsourcing of failover IPs allows another Dedibox account holder to manage them for you. You can outsource a Dedibox dedicated server and its allocated failover IPs so the other user can manage your virtual machines on your behalf.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net) 
</Message>

1. Click **Server** > **Network configuration** in the menu at the top of the web page to display the list of your failover IPs.
2. Click the settings (cog icon) next to the failover IP that you want to outsource. Then click **Outsourcing** in the menu that displays.

    The outsourcing form displays.
3. Enter the identifier of the new technical contact for your failover IP. The identifier is the login of other user's console account. Click **Send request** to validate the form.

    The destination account holder receives a notification to accept the outsourcing of your failover IP into their Scaleway Dedibox account.
