## How to create a Cloud Essentials for OpenSearch deployment

1. Click **OpenSearch** in the **Databases** section of the console. The Cloud Essentials for OpenSearch dashboard displays.

2. Click **+ Create deployment**. A creation form displays.

3. Select an OpenSearch version for your deployment.

4. Select a region where your resource will be deployed.

5. Select a deployment configuration. You can choose between:

    - **High Availability**: ensures fault tolerance in case of node failure, workload distribution across all nodes for improved performance, service continuity during rolling updates.
    - **Standalone**: cost-optimized single-node deployment for testing environments and non-critical, small-scale applications, without redundancy.

6. Choose a node type for your deployment. Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/opensearch/reference-content/shared-vs-dedicated-resources/) for more information on shared and dedicated compute resources.
