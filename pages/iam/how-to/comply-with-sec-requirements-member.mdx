Upon your [first login as a Member](/iam/how-to/log-in-as-a-member), you must comply with your Organization's security requirements to ensure you can log in without issues in the future.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account and logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com) as an [IAM Member](/iam/concepts/#member)

## How to check the security requirements

Organization administrators may require you to perform two different security actions:

- [Updating your password](#how-to-update-a-password)
- [Setting up MFA](#how-to-set-up-mfa-as-a-member)

If one of these requirements is enforced in your Organization, a security checklist will display in your Scaleway console when you log in for the first time,

<Lightbox src="scaleway-iam-member-sec-req.webp" alt="screenshot of the scaleway console showing a checklist of the few quick steps to follow until you can explore the Scaleway console. 1. Update password - You are required to update your password to stay connected to this Organization. A message box indicates that there is 1 day left to update the password. It warns that once this grace period is up, you will be locked out of the Organization until an administrator unlocks your account. A button prompts to update the password. "/>

<Message type="note">
The security requirements checklist is only visible to new Members who have not complied with their Organization's security requirements.
</Message>

### Grace period

New IAM Members have a [grace period](/iam/concepts/#grace-period) available to comply with security requirements. The grace period is defined by the Organization's administrator or is set to default (3 days).

<Message type="important">
Once the grace period is over, your Member account is automatically locked. This means you will no longer be able to log into the console and access your resources. You must personally contact an Organization administrator to unlock you. When you regain access to the Organization, the grace period resets and you have the set amount of time to comply with the requirements again.
</Message>

For example, if your Organization's grace period is set to default, you have 3 days, starting from your first login, to renew your password or define a new one, and to set up MFA. If you logged in for the first time on Monday 3:22 p.m., you have until Thursday at 3:22 p.m. to comply with security requirements. If you fail to comply, you will get locked out of the Organization starting from Thursday at approximately 3:23p.m.

## How to update a password

Passwords are not required for a first Member login.

However, if password renewal is enforced in your Organization, you must update your password after your first login.

<Message type="note">
Your Organization's administrator may provide you with a password for your first login. If password renewal is enforced in your Organization, you still need to update your password.
</Message>

1. Click **Update password** in your security requirements **Checklist** in the Scaleway console. A pop-up appears.
2. Define a new password in the box.
3. (Optional) Check the box if you want to send the password to your email.
    <Message type="tip">
    Make sure you copy and securely store the password, as it will only be shown once. If you lose access to your password, you must renew it again. Refer to the [How to manage members](/iam/how-to/manage-members#how-to-edit-a-members-information) documentation to learn how to renew your password after first renewal.
    </Message>

If all security requirements are met, you will be redirected to the Organization dashboard. If not, follow the steps of the [next section](#how-to-set-up-mfa-as-a-member) to complete the checklist.

## How to set up MFA as a Member

1. Click **Enable MFA** in your security requirements **Checklist** in the Scaleway console. A pop-up appears.
2. Follow the steps as indicated in the [How to use MFA](/account/how-to/use-2fa) documentation page.
