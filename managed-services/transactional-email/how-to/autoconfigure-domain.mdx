With Scaleway domains, you can now benefit from automatic DNS record creation and updates (autoconfiguration) for domains already registered with the Transactional Email service.
Automatic configuration of your DNS zone streamlines the setup of your domain for Transactional Email, allowing you to focus on sending emails and tracking traffic without manual configuration delays.

You can enable autoconfiguration directly from the Scaleway console (see instructions below), through the [Transactional Email API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/transactional-email/#path-domains-register-a-domain-in-a-project), or via [Terraform](https://github.com/scaleway/terraform-provider-scaleway/blob/master/docs/data-sources/tem_domain.md) using the `autoconfig` parameter (`bool`).

<Message type="note">
    This documentation covers the use of DNS autoconfiguration for domains already registerd with Transactional Email. If you want to add a new domain, refer to [How to configure your sending domain with Transactional Email](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/configure-domain-with-transactional-email/).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A domain name registered with [Scaleway Domains and DNS](/network/domains-and-dns/)

## How to enable DNS autoconfiguration

1. Click **Transactional Email** in the **Managed Services** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Transactional Email** overview page displays.
2. Click the domain you want to configure. The Transactional Email dashboard for the domain displays.
3. Click the **DNS Verification** tab.
4. Navigate to the **Autoconfiguration** section of the page, then click **Enable autoconfigration**. A pop-up displays.
5. Confirm by clicking **Enable autoconfiguration** in the pop-up. The DNS zone of your domain will be updated with SPF, DKIM, DMARC and MX records.
    <Message type="tip">
      During the autoconfiguration process, a blue dot appears next to your domain to indicate the status. Once the configuration is complete, the dot will turn green.

## How to disable DNS autoconfiguration

1. Click **Transactional Email** in the **Managed Services** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Transactional Email** overview page displays.
2. Click the domain you want to configure. The Transactional Email dashobard for the domain displays.
3. Click the **DNS Verification** tab.
4. Navigate to the **Autoconfiguration** section of the page, then click **Disable autoconfigration**. A pop-up displays.
5. Type **DISABLE** and click **Disable autoconfiguation** to disable the automatic configuration of the DNS.

<Message type="note">
- If you disable autoconfig, you have to **manually manage** DNS records (SPF, DKIM, MX, DMARC).
- **Existing DNS records are not deleted**. Disabling autoconfig does not remove the previously created DNS records. They will remain in place until manually modified or deleted. You can configure multiple mail servers or providers, which requires a single SPF and DMARC record for different domains. Therefore, the records are not automatically removed.
