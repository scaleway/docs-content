After the delivery of your server, you can begin installing it.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net)
  - You have a [Dedibox server](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/order-a-server)
</Message>

1. From the console, click **Server** > **Server list** on the top menu. A list of your servers displays.
2. Click **Manage** next to the server you want to install. The server install wizard displays.
3. Select the type of operating system you want to install. 
    <Message type="tip">
      For more information about OS types, refer to the [dedicated servers concepts page](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/concepts/#os-type).
    </Message>

    <Message type="note">
      If you wish to complete your installation using [KVM Over IP](/dedibox/kvm-over-ip/), click **Install over KVM** on this page.
    </Message>
4. Choose the operating system, and the OS version. Then, click **Install**. 
5. Personalize the [partitioning](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/concepts/#partioning) configuration:

    You can select the **Filesystem**, **RAID level** and set the **mount point** as well as the **partition size** in MB.

    If the server has two disks, the RAID levels **RAID 0**, **RAID 1** and **No RAID** are proposed. If the server has more than two disks installed, **RAID 5** is also proposed. Set the configuration towards your needs, if a software RAID is configured, make sure that the partitioning on all disks of the RAID is identical.

    The following restrictions apply during partitioning:
      - The disks can have a maximum of 4 primary partitions.
      - Do not create a `/var` partition, it is likely that the installation will fail.
      - The `/` partition must be at least 2048 MB large.
      - Once configured click VALIDATE to confirm the partition layout and to proceed to the next step.

  6. Set a user and eventually administrator password and select SSH keys that will be able to connect to the server. Click Next Step once all set.

  7. A configuration summary displays. Confirm the configuration by clicking DELETE ALL MY DISKS AND INSTALL THE SYSTEM!. This launches the automatic installation of the server.

    <Message type="important">
      This will delete all data present on the disks. Make sure to have a backup of your data before launching the re-installation of a Scaleway Dedibox to avoid data loss!
    </Message>

    <Message type="important">
      When you start a CentOS installation with custom partitioning, you need to keep about 5 GB of unallocated disk space to prevent the automatic installation system from crashing.
    </Message>
8. Configure the system parameters. You can edit parameters such as the name of the server, add a username, password and SSH key, and configure monitoring alerts and updates.
    <Message type="note">
      To connect to your server via SSH, it is recommended that you [create and upload your SSH key](/dedibox-console/my-account/how-to/upload-an-ssh-key/) at this stage so that it can be transferred to your server during installation.
    </Message>
9. Check that all information you entered is correct on the installation summary tab.

    Once the installation completes, your server will reboot on its hard disk.

<Message type="note">
  Depending on the OS, the installation may take several minutes to complete. Certain operating systems may require additional reboots for completion. We recommend waiting 45 to 60 minutes before you connect to your server.
