Kubernetes Kosmos provides an alternative to a classic [Kubernetes Kapsule](/compute/kubernetes/concepts#kubernetes-kapsule). With Kubernetes Kosmos, you can create a Kubernetes cluster comprising both managed Scaleway Instances (with auto-healing and auto-scaling) and also external Instances and servers from any other Cloud Provider. Scaleway still ensures the high availability of your services all over the world, in different zones, regions, and providers. In addition to the Kubernetes Kapsule pricing, you are charged for the Kubernetes Kosmos control plane, as well as an additional fee for managed external nodes.

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) 

</Message>

<Message type="important">

  Be aware that auto scaling and auto healing features are not available on external providers' nodes within Kosmos clusters. Since Scaleway does not have access to your other providersâ€™ accounts, it is not possible to carry out actions such as automatic deletion, creation,and reboot of external nodes.

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Compute** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Kubernetes dashboard displays.

2. Click **Create a cluster**. The first page of the Cluster Creation Wizard displays. This concerns the configuration of your cluster.

3. Complete the following steps of the wizard:

    <Lightbox src="/assets/scaleway-choose-cluster-type.png" alt="" />    
    
    * Choose a **Cluster Type**. This can be Kubernetes Kapsule or Kubernetes Kosmos.

      * **Kubernetes Kapsule** allows you to create clusters exclusively of Scaleway Instances, and includes features such as node auto-healing and pool auto-scaling.
      * **Kubernetes Kosmos** allows you to attach a Compute Instance or dedicated server from any Cloud provider to a Scaleway Kubernetes control plane.

      This document concerns the creation and management of a **Kubernetes Kosmos** cluster. To create a Kubernetes Kapsule Cluster, refer to the [alternative documentation](/compute/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster)

    * The geographical **region** of the cluster.

    * The Kubernetes **version** for the cluster.

    * A **name** for the cluster and optionally a description and tags.

4. Click **Create a Cluster** to create your cluster without any Scaleway Pools. If you choose this option, your cluster and its control plane are deployed, and you are taken to the cluster's Overview tab. Continue to [How to manage your Kubernetes Kosmos cluster](/compute/kubernetes/how-to/edit-kosmos-cluster) to find out how to add multi-cloud pools to your cluster.

    Alternatively, click **Add and Configure a Pool** to add a pool of Scaleway nodes to your cluster. In this case, the second page of the Cluster Creation Wizard displays. This concerns the settings for your pool. 

5. Enter:

    * The **availability zone** in which all your pool's nodes will be created.

    * The **node type** you require.

    * The configuration for your **node options**, including the number of nodes and whether to enable autoscale. You can also choose whether to enable autoheal and whether to link the cluster to a placement group. Alternatively, you can leave these options at default values.

6. Click **Create a cluster**.

Your cluster is deployed and you are taken to the cluster's Overview tab.
