Starting **November 26, 2024**, a rate limit of **20 DNS queries per second** per Container instance will be applied. This limit only applies to queries that require a full DNS resolution and is enforced independently for each Container instance.

This rate limit is set at a level that is well above typical usage, so most users should not be impacted.
