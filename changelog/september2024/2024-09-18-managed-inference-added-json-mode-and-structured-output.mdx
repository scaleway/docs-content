All AI models can now reliably generate JSON output when required. The [Chat Completions API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/ai-data/managed-inference/reference-content/openai-compatibility/#supported-parameters) supports the `response_format` parameter, which can be set to either `json_object` or `json_schema`, following OpenAI's specifications exactly. 

Refer to [our documentation for code examples](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/ai-data/generative-apis/how-to/use-structured-outputs/), including usage with Pydantic models or manual schema definitions.
