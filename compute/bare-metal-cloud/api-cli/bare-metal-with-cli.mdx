excerpt: |
  Scaleway’s [Bare Metal Cloud Servers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/bare-metal-servers/) provide you with dedicated servers on-demand, with all the benefits of the cloud including flexibility and hourly billing. These servers are great for large workloads, big data, and (because no-one else is sharing your server) applications that require increased security and dedicated resources. You can create and manage your Bare Metal servers from the console, via the API or via the Scaleway Command Line Interface (CLI). In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the CLI to create a Bare Metal Server, install an OS and  manage the lifecycle of the server.

Scaleway’s [Bare Metal Cloud Servers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/bare-metal-servers/) provide you with dedicated servers on-demand, with all the benefits of the cloud including flexibility and hourly billing. These servers are great for large workloads, big data and (because no-one else is sharing your server) applications that require increased security and dedicated resources.

You can create and manage your Bare Metal servers from the console, via the API or via the Scaleway Command Line Interface.

## Scaleway Command Line Interface Overview

[The Scaleway Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli) allows you to pilot your Scaleway infrastructure directly from your terminal, providing a faster way to administer and monitor your resources. Scaleway CLI is easy to set up and use, and an essential tool for operating efficiently in your cloud environment. The CLI provides many functionalities, including the ability to create and administer Bare Metal Servers.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) 
- You have [configured your SSH Key](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- You have [generated your API key](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key/)
- You have [downloaded and installed the Scaleway CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli)

</Message>

## Configuring the CLI

1. Open a terminal and type the following command to configure the Scaleway CLI on your machine:

  ```
  scw init
  ```

  If you have already configured the CLI, you will see a message like the following:

  ```
  Current config is located at /path/to/config.yaml
  access_key: <YOUR ACCESS KEY>
  secret_key: <YOUR SECRET KEY>
  default_organization_id: <YOUR ORGANIZATION ID>
  default_project_id: <YOUR PROJECT ID>
  default_region: <YOUR DEFAULT REGION, eg fr-par>
  default_zone: <YOUR DEFAULT ZONE, eg fr-par-1>

  Do you want to override the current config? (Y/n):  
  ```

2. Type `n` and go directly to the [Creating a Bare Metal Server](#creating-a-bare-metal-server) step of this tutorial if you do not want to edit your configuration.

  If you have not yet configured the CLI, you will be guided through the configuration process via a series of questions:

  ```
  Enter a valid secret-key or an email
  ```

3. Enter either the email address for your account (you will then be asked for your password), or your [API Secret Key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key)

  ```
  To improve this tool we rely on diagnostic and usage data.
  Sending such data is optional and can be disabled at any time by running "scw config set send-telemetry=false".
  Do you want to send usage statistics and diagnostics? (Y/n):
  ```

 Type `y` or `n`.

  ```
  To fully enjoy Scaleway CLI we recommend you install autocomplete support in your shell.
  Do you want to install autocomplete? (Y/n):
  ```

 Type `y` or `n`.

  ```
  To enable autocomplete, scw needs to update your shell configuration.
  What type of shell are you using (default: zsh):
  ```

4. Enter if the default shell type is the one you are using. Otherwise, enter the correct shell type you are using. This should complete the configuration process:

  ```
  Initialization completed with success.
  ```

## Using other CLI commands

There are many other functionalities you can access for your Bare Metal Server via the Scaleway CLI. In the following examples, replace the Bare Metal Server ID with the ID of your Bare Metal server:

<Message type="note">

Before powering off your Bare Metal server, you should [log into your server as root](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/bare-metal-cloud/how-to/connect-to-server/) and execute the `halt` command to shutdown the OS. If you're not sure of the IP address of your Bare Metal server, for login purposes, use the `scw baremetal server get <Server-ID/> zone=fr-par-2` command to see this information in the `IPs.0.Address` field

</Message>

-**To power off** your Bare Metal Server, use the following command:

  ```
  scw baremetal server stop <Bare Metal Server ID> zone=fr-par-2
  ```

-**To power on** your Bare Metal Server, use the following command:

  ```
  scw baremetal server start <Bare Metal Server ID> zone=fr-par-2
  ```

-**To reboot** your Bare Metal Server, use the following command:

  ```
  scw baremetal server reboot <Bare Metal Server ID> zone=fr-par-2
  ```

  For further information, execute the `help` command:

  ```
  scw baremetal server --help
  ```

## Deleting your Bare Metal Server

<Message type="note">

This will permanently delete your Bare Metal server and all your data will be lost. This action is irreversible.

</Message>

When you want to remove your Bare Metal server, at the end of its lifecycle, you can delete it with the following command.

```
scw baremetal server reboot <Bare Metal Server ID> zone=fr-par-2
```

You will see an output like the following:

```

```

Note that the `status` field now says `deleting`. The deletion process may take a few minutes. You can check that your Bare Metal server has been deleted by verifying that it is not returned when you enter the command:

```
scw baremetal server list zone=fr-par-2
```

## Conclusion and going further

You now know how to create a Bare Metal server via the Scaleway CLI, as well as install an OS, power the server off and on, reboot it, and delete it. You can use the `--help` command as described with the Scaleway CLI to find more information about its different functionalities and parameters. More information about the Scaleway CLI is available in the [GitHub documentation](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/tree/master/docs/commands).
