## DNS query Rate limiting

To ensure the stability and performance of our Serverless Functions and Containers platform, we have implemented a rate limit to the number of DNS queries that can be made by users. This rate limit is designed to prevent any single container instance from consuming excessive resources and impacting the performance of other users' functions and containers.

## Rate limit details

The rate limit is set at **20 requests per second per function or container instance**.

This limit only applies to DNS queries that require a full resolution, such as queries for records that have not been previously resolved.
Queries for records that have already been resolved recently are not subject to this rate limit.

<Message type="important">
The rate limit is applied per function or container instance, not per user or client.

The rate limit is therefore enforced independently for each function or container instance, regardless of the user or client that owns it.
</Message>

## Effective date

The DNS query rate limit will be enforced starting on November, 26th 2024. Any DNS queries made after this time will be subject to the rate limit.

## Why rate limiting is necessary

Our Serverless Functions and Containers platform is a shared infrastructure, which means that multiple users' functions or containers are running on the same nodes. In the past, we have experienced issues with high DNS query volumes from some function or container instances, which have impacted the performance of other users' containers. These issues have led to DNS resolution delays, timeouts, and other problems that affect the overall stability and performance of our platform.

To mitigate these issues, we have implemented rate limiting on DNS queries. By limiting the number of DNS queries that can be made by each function or container instance, we can prevent any single instance from consuming all available DNS resources and causing problems for other users. 

<Message type="note">
The 20 requests per second limit is far above the typical usage patterns we have seen from legitimate users, and it only applies to DNS queries that require a full resolution. Therefore, this rate limit should not impact most users.
</Message>

## Impact on legitimate users

We understand that rate limiting may restrict some users' activities, but we believe that this is a necessary measure to ensure the overall stability and performance of our platform. Legitimate users who are making reasonable use of our platform should not be affected by this rate limit. In fact, rate limiting will help to ensure that our platform remains responsive and high-performing for all users, even in case of high traffic or malicious activity.

## Optimizing DNS query usage

If you are experiencing issues with the DNS query rate limit, review your application's DNS query usage to see if there are any opportunities for optimization. 

However, this rate limit is intended to prevent excessive DNS query volumes, and most users should not need to take any action to avoid hitting the limit.

## Future changes to the rate limit

Scaleway reserves the right to adjust the rate limit in the future as needed to ensure the stability and performance of our platform. We will notify users of any changes to the rate limit through our usual communication channels.

## Additional support

If you have specific needs that require a higher DNS query volume, you may be able to implement optimizations on the application side to reduce the number of DNS queries made.
