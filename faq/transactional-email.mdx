## What are transactional emails?

A transactional email is a type of automated, non-promotional email triggered by interactions with a website or an application, e.g. account creation, password modification, new order, payment status, etc. Unlike marketing emails, transactional emails are usually expected by customers and thus, have much higher open rate than marketing emails.

## How can I configure DNS records to send emails?

You need to [add SPF and DKIM records](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/add-spf-dkim-records-to-your-domain) to be able to send emails. Find out [how to set up your DNS records for other DNS providers](/tutorials/set-up-spf-dkim-for-dns-providers/).

## How do I know if my domain is valid for sending emails?

After configuring your SPF and DKIM records, you must launch a verification of the domain either via [the console](https://console.scaleway.com/transactional-email/domains/fr-par/53356a15-a2af-4200-b4d3-a69fbf687064/dns-verification) or the API. You will then receive an email informing you whether your domain was validated or if there are errors to fix so it can be validated.

## Do I have to set up an MX record for a better email deliverability?

Setting up an [MX record](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts#mx-record) is not mandatory, but we recommend you do it because mail servers may not know where to send your emails, which could lead to your emails being rejected or delivery failures.
