IAM users and appliations are  that 

## Users

An IAM user is a human user in an Organization. They can be of two types: 

- **Owner** - you are the Owner of the Organization that was created with your account. 
- **Guest** you are Guest when invited to another Organization of which you are not the Owner. Similarly, you can invite other users to be Guests in your Organization. 
Within each Organization, different IAM users can have different rights (defined through policies) to perform actions on resources.


## Applications

An IAM application is a non-human user in an Organization. IAM applications may be used when you want to create an API key that is not linked to a user, to give programmatic access to resources. Note that applications cannot by definition have access to the Scaleway console, as they have only an API key and no account themselve (they are not human account root users).

extended documentation should mention:
All applications within an Organization must have a unique name (eg my crawler agent).
One use case could be to create an API key that is not linked to any particular user since the user could be deleted (eg an employee could leave a company).
