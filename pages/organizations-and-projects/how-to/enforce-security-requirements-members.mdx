For the increased security of your Organization, you can enforce different security measures for your IAM members.

<Message type="important">
  The security measures listed on this page, except enforcing MFA, apply only to [IAM members](/iam/concepts#members).

## How to disable a member's MFA

If [Multifactor Authentication (MFA) is enabled](/account/how-to/use-2fa) for a member you can disable it anytime. Disabling MFA is useful if the member lost access to their authentication app and needs to reset MFA.

1. Click **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** on the top-right corner of your [Organization Dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) in the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) displays.
2. Click the name of the member you want to delete. Alternatively, click <Icon name="more" /> next to the member, and select **Overview**. Either way, you are taken to the user's **Overview** tab.
3. Click the **Credentials** tab.
4. Scroll to the **Disable multifactor authentication** section.
5. Click **Disable MFA**. A pop-up appears
    <Message type="important">
      Keep in mind that disabling MFA means a member will no longer be required to sign in with MFA. If [MFA is enforced](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/enforce-mfa) at the Organization level, the member will have a grace period allowing them to enable it again.
    </Message>
6. Type **DISABLE** in the box and click **Confirm**.

## How to enforce password renewal

1. Click the **Security** tab of the [Organization Dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/organization).
2. Scroll to the **Password renewal** section.
3. Click **Enforce renewal**. A pop-up displays.
    <Message type="important">
      Enforcing password renewal means that all members with a password in the Organization will be request to reset it upon their first login.
    </Message>
4. Type **ENFORCE** in the box and click **Confirm**.

## How to stop enforcing password renewal

1. Click the **Security** tab of the [Organization Dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/organization).
2. Scroll to the **Password renewal** section.
3. Click **Stop enforcing renewal**. A pop-up displays.
4. Type **STOP** in the box and click **Confirm**.

## How to edit the grace period of your Organization

From their first login, members have a default grace period of seven days to comply with security requirements before their access to the Organization is automatically locked. You can extend or reduce the grace period in the console.

<Message type="important">
  Locked members cannot connect to the Organization until they are [manually unlocked](/iam/how-to/manage-members#how-to-unlock-a-member). Upon regaining access, the grace period resets, giving them another chance to meet security requirements.
</Message>

1. Click the **Security** tab of the [Organization Dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/organization).
2. Scroll to the **Grace period** section.
3. Click **Define grace period**. A pop-up displays.
4. Define the grace period in hours or days.
5. Click **Define grace period** to confirm.

## How to set a maximum number of login attempts

Currently, a default number of maximum 5 login attempts is set up for your Organization automatically.

## How to enforce MFA for a member

You can enforce MFA for all users in your Organization, including members.

Refer to the [How to enforce MFA](/pages/organizations-and-projects/how-to/enforce-mfa) documentation page for more information.
