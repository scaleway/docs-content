In this tutorial we will use the API through the Scaleway command line interface [CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli#Installation). This will show you how to create Hubs and Devices, as well as more advanced features of the Scaleway IoT Hub: Hub Events and Routes.

You can find the API reference documentation at the following link: [IoT API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/iot/)

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) 
  - You have `mosquitto-clients` (mqtt client), and `jq` (json parsing tool) installed on your computer
</Message>

## CLI setup and configuration

If you already have configured the Scaleway command-line interface, you can skip this section. However, we recommend checking it for updates.

1. Follow the [CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli#Installation) installation steps.
2. Configure your CLI by running the following command and answering the questions:
    ```bash
    scw init
    ```

## Setting up the hub

The Hub creation is done through the `scw iot hub create` command, your CLI configuration already includes the project ID, you can optionally set:
- A name, with `name="my_first_hub"`. For this tutorial purposes, the name is not important.
- A product plan, with `product-plan="plan_dedicated"`.

1. Save the output to a `hub.json` file to make it easier later, so we need to tell the CLI to output as `json`:
    ```bash
    scw iot hub create -o json > hub.json

    jq < hub.json
    ```

    The file `hub.json` will contain come content as like the following example:

    ```json
    {
    "id": "b20c3639-9030-496c-a1b2-6feb15846726",
    "name": "cli-hub-cocky-hugle",
    "status": "enabling",
    "product_plan": "plan_shared",
    "enabled": true,
    "device_count": 0,
    "connected_device_count": 0,
    "endpoint": "iot.fr-par.scw.cloud",
    "disable_events": false,
    "events_topic_prefix": "$SCW/events",
    "region": "fr-par",
    "created_at": "2021-04-26T08:46:33.436Z",
    "updated_at": "2021-04-26T08:46:33.436Z",
    "project_id": "<your project ID>",
    "organization_id": "<your organization ID>",
    "enable_device_auto_provisioning": false,
    "has_custom_ca": false
    }

    ```
2. Poll the hub status until it is ready:
    ```bash
    scw iot hub get $(jq -r '.id' hub.json) | grep Status
    ```

    At some point, the status will switch to `ready`.

## Set up the devices

Now create 2 devices. You just need to provide:
- The Hub ID. This is the `"id"` field from the JSON response received while creating a hub.
- (Optional) A name. Again, the name is not important for this tutorial.

<Message type="note">
  As this tutorial aims to be simple and straightforward, the following commands are allowing the device to connect using insecure protocols, such as plain text MQTT or MQTTs without mutual authentication. In production, you should `Deny Insecure` connections to have the highest level of security. This is done by setting the field `allow-insecure` to `false`.
</Message>

1. Save the response to a file so we can use the fields later.
    ```bash
    scw iot device create \
    hub-id=$(jq -r '.id' hub.json) \
    allow-insecure=true \
    -o json > dev1.json

    jq < dev1.json
    ```

    The file `dev1.json` should contain something similar to:

    ```json
    {
    "device": {
        "id": "0a184d04-aa69-43e5-8fbf-0ee0793aea43",
        "name": "cli-device-pensive-bassi",
        "description": "",
        "status": "enabled",
        "hub_id": "b20c3639-9030-496c-a1b2-6feb15846726",
        "last_activity_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "is_connected": false,
        "allow_insecure": true,
        "allow_multiple_connections": false,
        "message_filters": {
        "publish": {
            "policy": "reject",
            "topics": []
        },
        "subscribe": {
            "policy": "reject",
            "topics": []
        }
        },
        "created_at": "2021-04-26T09:36:10.708Z",
        "updated_at": "2021-04-26T09:36:10.708Z"
    },
    "certificate": {
        "crt": "<certificate here>",
        "key": "<certificate key here>"
    }
    }
    ```
2. Now create a second device:
    ```bash
    scw iot device create \
    hub-id=$(jq -r '.id' hub.json) \
    allow-insecure=true \
    -o json > dev2.json

    jq < dev2.json
    ```

## Subscribe and Publish

Now that everything is set up, let's simulate 2 devices and send data.

1. Setup the subscriber:
    ```bash
    # In one terminal
    mosquitto_sub \
    -h $(jq -r '.endpoint' hub.json) \
    -i $(jq -r '.device.id' dev1.json) \
    -t mytopic/mysubtopic
    ```
2. Run the publisher:
    ```bash
    # In another terminal
    mosquitto_pub \
    -h $(jq -r '.endpoint' hub.json) \
    -i $(jq -r '.device.id' dev2.json) \
    -t mytopic/mysubtopic \
    -m 'Hello, world!'
    ```

    You should see the subscriber receive the `Hello, world!` message.

## Setting up TLS mutual authentication

If you require security, you can also connect your device to the Hub using TLS mutual authentication. With this method, the Hub can check the device's identity, and the device can check the Hub's identity.

<Message type="note">
  It is possible to connect to the Hub using TLS but without Mutual authentication. In this case, the device certificates are not needed as the Hub does not need to check the device identity. But the Hub certificate will still be needed as your client must check the hub's identity.

1. Start by downloading the IoT Hub CA:
    ```bash
    curl -sS -O https://iot.s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud/certificates/fr-par/iot-hub-ca.pem
    sha1sum iot-hub-ca.pem
    # 13cf3e59ed52d4c4b6bc249e85539d5fd5d572fb  iot-hub-ca.pem
    ```
2. Then extract the certificates from the device JSON files, so that the mosquitto clients may use them:
    ```bash
    jq -r '.certificate.crt' dev1.json > dev1.crt
    jq -r '.certificate.key' dev1.json > dev1.key
    jq -r '.certificate.crt' dev2.json > dev2.crt
    jq -r '.certificate.key' dev2.json > dev2.key
    ```
3. Run the same test as before, but with the added security:
    ```bash
    # In one terminal
    mosquitto_sub \
    -h $(jq -r '.endpoint' hub.json) -p 8883 \
    --cert dev1.crt --key dev1.key --cafile iot-hub-ca.pem \
    -i $(jq -r '.device.id' dev1.json) \
    -t mytopic/mysubtopic
    ```

    ```bash
    # In another terminal
    mosquitto_pub \
    -h $(jq -r '.endpoint' hub.json) -p 8883 \
    --cert dev2.crt --key dev2.key --cafile iot-hub-ca.pem \
    -i $(jq -r '.device.id' dev2.json) \
    -t mytopic/mysubtopic \
    -m 'Hello, SECURE world!'
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      You can mix MQTT and MQTTs clients on the same hub.

You can harness the real power of MQTT Pub/Sub with this blog post: [An Introduction to the MQTT protocol](https://www.scaleway.com/en/blog/introduction-to-mqtt-protocol/).
