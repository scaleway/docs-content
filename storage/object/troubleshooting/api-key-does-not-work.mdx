## Problem

When using third party API or CLI tools such as the [AWS CLI](/storage/object/api-cli/object-storage-aws-cli/), MinIO Client or Rclone to manage your Object Storage resources, you may experience one of the following issues connecting to the Scaleway API or listing your resources:

- Listing your buckets with a third party tool returns nothing, but you have at least one bucket created in the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com/object-storage/buckets).

- The tool returns `An error occurred (Forbidden) when calling the ListObjectsV2 operation: Forbidden` or a similar message.

## Cause

The API key you used to configure the S3 third party tool has a [preferred Project](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#preferred-project) assigned.

If you try to perform S3 operations in a Project that is **NOT** the [preferred Project](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#preferred-project) using a third party tool, you will not be able to access your resources, resulting in an error message or an empty response.

## Solution

You can change the preferred project of your API key:

- by editing it from the [Scaleway console](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/manage-api-keys/#how-to-edit-an-api-key)
- by [overriding it while making an API call](/identity-and-access-management/iam/api-cli/using-api-key-object-storage/#overriding-the-preferred-project-when-making-a-call)

You should now be able to list your buckets using supported S3-compatible third-party tool.

Refer to the documentation on [using IAM API keys with Object Storage](/identity-and-access-management/iam/api-cli/using-api-key-object-storage/) for more information.
