Object Storage offers a versatile solution for storing a wide array of objects, including documents, images, videos, and more, with the convenience of retrieval from any location.

For example, images stored in Object Storage become readily accessible via HTTP protocols.
Manage your storage through the intuitive control panel, while also benefiting from various tools designed to streamline interactions with Object Storage.
Among these tools, Cyberduck stands out as a reliable and efficient option for seamless integration and management of your stored objects.

## Configuring Cyberduck

1. To use Cyberduck with Object Storage, you need to import a configuration file. Copy & paste the following code into a file where the `region`, `hostname`, and `description` are updated with your values `scaleway.cyberduckprofile`:
    ```xml
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
    <plist version="1.0">
        <dict>
            <key>Protocol</key>
            <string>s3</string>
            <key>Vendor</key>
            <string>poc</string>
            <key>Description</key>
            <string>s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud</string>
            <key>Default Hostname</key>
            <string>s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud</string>
            <key>Default Port</key>
            <string>443</string>
            <key>Username Placeholder</key>
            <string>Access Key</string>
            <key>Password Placeholder</key>
            <string>Secret Key</string>
            <key>Authorization</key>
            <string>AWS4HMACSHA256</string>
            <key>Region</key>
            <string>nl-ams</string>
            <key>Regions</key>
            <array>
                <string>nl-ams</string>
            </array>
        </dict>
    </plist>
    ```
    <Message type="important">
      Edit the `region` parameter to the region of your bucket. It can either be `fr-par` (Paris, France), `nl-ams` (Amsterdam, The Netherlands), or `pl-waw`(Warsaw, Poland).
    </Message>
2. Save the file and double-click it to open Cyberduck.
3. Fill `<Access Key ID>` with your access key and `<Secret Key ID>` with your secret key.
