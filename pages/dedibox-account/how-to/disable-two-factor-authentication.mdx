You can disable the multifactor authentication of your Dedibox account if you want to register a new authentication device.

For security reasons, it is **not recommended to disable** multifactor authentication permanently.
</Message>

## How to disable multifactor authentication

1. Click your username, next to _logged in as_, in the top right corner of the Dedibox console. Then click **Security** in the pop-up menu.

2. The security page displays. Click **Disable two factor authenticaton**.
3. Enter a security token generated by your multifactor authentication application and click **Confirm**.

Multifactor authentication is now disabled, and you can log in with your identifier and password only.

## How to restore access to your account

If you lose both your MFA app and backup codes, the only way to regain access to your account is through a manual identity verification.

To do so, make a request to our Trust and Safety team. You must make your request from the email address registered on your account. In your email, provide the following information:

* Your username
* The telephone number registered on your account
* If you have an individual account, your passport or local ID card
* If you have a corporate account, the certificate of incorporation and a copy of the last Dedibox invoice you received

Submit the complete set of required documents via email to [mailto:document@scaleway.com](document@scaleway.com)

After analyzing your documents, our team will deactivate your two-factor authentication (2FA).
