You can upgrade your Database Instances in two ways: by increasing its Block Storage volume or by changing the node type.

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)  
  - You have a managed [Database Instance](/databases/databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/concepts/#managed-database)

## How to increase a Block Storage volume

<Message type="note">

- Block Storage for Databases is available for Database Instances located in the `PAR`, `AMS`, and `WAW` regions.
- Your Managed Database requires you to have a Block Storage [volume](/storage/block/concepts/#block-device) 

</Message>

1. Scroll down to **Volume settings** in the overview page of your selected Database Instance.
2. Click **Increase Volume Size**. A pop up appears. 
3. Specify your volume capacity (in GB). The amount you define will be your new volume capacity.
  <Message type="important">

    * You can increase your Block Storage volume to up to 10 TB. 
    * Block volume sizes cannot be decreased.

  </Message>
4. Click **Increase Volume** to confirm. 

## How to change the node type

In case you want to upgrade to an Instance with local storage, you have to change the Database node type. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. Click **Databases for PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Database** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays. 
=======
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD:databases/databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/upgrade-a-database.mdx
1. Click **Databases for PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Database** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays. 
=======
1. Click **Managed Databases for PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Database** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays. 
>>>>>>> feat(redis): change menus:database/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/upgrade-a-database.mdx
=======
1. Click **Databases for PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Database** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays. 
>>>>>>> fix(redis): remove managed
>>>>>>> fix(redis): links
2. Click the name of the Instance that you want to upgrade.
3. Scroll down to the **Node Settings** section in the **Database Information** page. Then, click **Modify Node Type**.
4. Choose the specifications of the new Database Instance from the dropdown list.
5. Click **Validate** to confirm your choices. 
  <Message type="important">

  Make sure that the Database Instance you choose provides sufficient disk space for your database. Otherwise, an error message will be displayed and the database will not be upgraded.

  </Message>

The action of changing the node type will perform a rolling upgrade of your Database Instance. During this process, the Database Instance will not be available for several tens of seconds.
