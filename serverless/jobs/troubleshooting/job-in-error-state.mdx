## Problem

My job run is in an error state.

## Possible solutions

- Make sure that you have built your image for an `amd64` architecture, as `arm64` is not supported. See the [Architecture](/serverless/jobs/reference-content/jobs-limitations/#architecture) documentation for more information.

- Make sure that your deployment does not exceed the limitations of [Serverless Jobs](/serverless/jobs/reference-content/jobs-limitations/).
