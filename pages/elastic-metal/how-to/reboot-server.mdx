If your [Elastic Metal server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/elastic-metal/) is no longer reachable from the internet or does not work as expected, you can reboot it from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com). The reboot feature launches a power-cycle on the physical hardware and restarts the machine.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An Elastic Metal server [installed](/elastic-metal/quickstart/#how-to-create-an-elastic-metal-server)


1. Click **Elastic Metal** in the **Bare Metal** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Elastic Metal dashboard displays.
2. Click the name of the server you want to reboot.
3. Click the **Reboot** button on the server information page.
4. Select the **Normal** reboot mode and confirm by clicking **Reboot Elastic Metal server**.
    <Message type="important">
      Rebooting your server may corrupt your data if there are unwritten files. Your software will not be stopped before the server is being rebooted, and you should use this feature only when your server is not reachable over the internet.
