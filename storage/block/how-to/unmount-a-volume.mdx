It is important to unmount a volume from the operating system using the `umount` command to avoid data loss before [removing the volume](/storage/block/how-to/detach-a-volume/) from the machine.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created an [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- Created an [Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance) with an additional Block Storage volume


1. Open a terminal and use the following command to connect to your Instance. Make sure that you replace `<your_instance_ip>` with your Instance's IP. You can also find the SSH command in your Instance's **Overview** tab in the Scaleway console.
    ```
    ssh root@<your_instance_ip>
    ```
2. Use `lsblk` to check where your volume is mounted. You should see an output similar to the following:

    ```
    root@scw-heuristic-shtern:~# lsblk
    NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
    sdb       8:0    0 18.6G  0 disk /mnt/block-volume
    ```
3. Unmount the volume to remove it from your current setup. Replace `/mnt/block-volume` with your mount point.
    ```
    umount /mnt/block-volume
    ```
4.  Check that the volume is no longer mounted in the system with `lsblk`.
    ```
    root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# lsblk
    NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    sdb       8:0    0 18.6G  0 disk
    ```
    <Message type="important">
      Do not forget to edit the `/etc/fstab` file and delete the line corresponding to your block volume.

Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/storage/block/api-cli/managing-a-volume/) for more information about managing your Block Storage volumes.
