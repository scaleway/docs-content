**S**ystem for **C**ross-domain **I**dentity **M**anagement (SCIM) is a standard protocol for exchanging user identity and authorization data between an Identity Provider (IdP) and a Service Provider.

Combined with [SAML](/iam/how-to/set-up-identity-federation), it allows IAM managers to fully manage user authentication, lifecycle, and personal data through their Identity Provider:
- SAML is used for members to log in, by authenticating on their Identity Provider with the IdP-defined authentication policies 
- SCIM is used to automatically create, update, lock, unlock, and delete Scaleway users based on actions performed on the user directory of the Identity Provider

<Message type="important">
  Only SCIM user-related actions are currently supported by Scaleway. Group auto-provisioning is planned to be available in the coming months.
</Message>

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to enable SCIM

1. Click the **Settings** button in the upper-right corner of the Organization Dashboard. The [Organization Settings](https://console.scaleway.com/settings) page displays.
  Alternatively, click the avatar icon on the upper-right corner of the header navigation, and select **Settings** on the drop-down menu.
2. Click **Automatic user provisioning (SCIM)**, under **Organization security**, on the left navigation menu. The SCIM section displays.
3. Click the **Enable** button. A pop-up displays, informing you that a token creation is required to enable SCIM.
4. Click the **Enable SCIM and create token** button. SCIM is now enabled for the Organization, and two fields are displayed and must be copied:
- A **SCIM token**, which is used by the Identity Provider to authenticate to Scaleway and perform the necessary actions. This token is **sensitive** and should not be shared with anyone.
- A **base URL**, which is used by the Identity Provider to locate the Scaleway account to which connect.

<Message type="important">
  Both the SCIM token and the base URL are important pieces of information that are only displayed once. Copy and safely store them before closing the pop-up. **You will need them to set up SCIM with your Identity Provider.**
</Message>

5. Click **Close**.
   The configuration is complete on the Scaleway side, but you must now carry out the SCIM setup on your Identity provider.
   
<Message type="note">
      To ensure the correct configuration of SCIM, you can perform actions such as changing a name or creating a user directly on your Identity Provider. You should then see:
      - The impacts reflected on your Scaleway [users](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users)
      - The update events listed in the Paris region of your [Audit Trail dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/audit-trail/fr-par/events)
</Message>

<Message type="important">
      By default, SCIM manages users only if their usernames match between the Identity Provider and Scaleway. The federation **compares users from both sources**, and users not found on the Identity Provider are not impacted by SCIM configuration.
      If you wish to manage not-found users via SCIM, you must re-create them on the Identity Provider or change settings on the Identity Provider side.
</Message>

Depending on the provider, changes might take from a few seconds to up to 30 minutes to be synchronized. This delay cannot be modified by Scaleway.

## How to rotate a SCIM token

You can have up to two active SCIM tokens at a time. To create a second token:

1. Click the **Settings** button in the upper-right corner of the Organization Dashboard. The [Organization Settings](https://console.scaleway.com/settings) page displays.
2. Click **Automatic user provisioning (SCIM)**, under **Organization security**, on the left navigation menu. The SCIM section displays.
3. Click **Generate token**. A pop-up displays.
4. Follow the same steps for [first enabling SCIM](/iam/how-to/manage-users-with-scim/#how-to-enable-scim).

<Message type="important">
  Ensure to replace the previous SCIM token with the new one on your Identity Provider.
</Message>

5. Check if the SCIM configuration is still working.

   Optionally, you can delete the previous token if no longer necessary.

<Message type="note">
      SCIM tokens have a time-to-live of 1 year. When a token expires, it can no longer be used to provision users, and a new token must be created to keep SCIM synchronization working.
</Message>

## How to disable SCIM

1. Click the **Settings** button in the upper-right corner of the Organization Dashboard. The [Organization Settings](https://console.scaleway.com/settings) page displays.
2. Click **Automatic user provisioning (SCIM)**, under **Organization security**, on the left navigation menu. The SCIM section displays.
3. Click the **Disable** button.
4. Type **Disable** to confirm.
    <Message type="important">
      If SCIM is disabled on Scaleway, your Identity Provider will no longer be able to perform any actions on users, even if the configuration is correctly done on this side.
