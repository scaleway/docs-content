    | **Type**                    | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
    |-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | **Brute force**             | You notice Scaleway services are being used for attempts to obtain your passwords and/or usernames via the mass testing of different password and username combinations.                                                                                                                                                                                |
    | **Open relay**              | You notice a Scaleway open SMTP server would allow spam campaigns to hide behind a source which does not belong to them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
    | **Security hole**           | You notice a security hole, which has not been corrected, in a Scaleway service which would allow non-authorized persons to connect to your system, in particular to trigger DDoS/BRUTE FORCE attacks or to gather sensitive information.                                                                                                               |
    | **Virus**                   | You notice Scaleway services are being used to share a program which disrupts the functioning of a computer and can rapidly spread between computers connected to a digital network.                                                                                                                                                                    |
    | **Spam**                    | You are receiving unwanted emails from a Scaleway-owned server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
    | **Botnet**                  | You notice a network of bots, connected programs where at least one is hosted by Scaleway, that communicate between each other in order to trigger joint wrongdoing.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
    | **Phishing**                | You notice a website or email simulating an official campaign is being hosted or sent using Scaleway services in order to gather banking information and/or usernames and passwords.                                                                                                                                                                    |
    | **Denial-of-service (DoS)** | You notice a joint attack from multiple Scaleway servers that neutralizes or attempts to neutralize your service, site, or applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
    | **Illegal content**         | You notice content or behavior that constitutes an infraction under the fifth, seventh, and eighth paragraphs of article 24 of the French Law on the Freedom of the Press dated 29 July 1881 and articles 222-33, 225-4-1, 225-5, 225-6, 227-23 and 227-24 and 421-2-5 of the French Penal Code, is being shared or is occurring via Scaleway services. |

    Scaleway's Trust & Safety team will verify the exactness of the report, that all the necessary information has been provided for the report to be processed and whether the report indeed relates to explicitly illegal behavior or content with regard to French regulations and the evidence and information you have provided. If your report meets the above criteria, it will be validated by the Trust & Safety team and sent to Scaleway's customer so that the necessary corrective measures can be taken.
2. You will receive the customer's answer via the email address provided in the form.
    <Message type="note">
      Should Scaleway's customer not respond, or should the transferred report not be processed correctly, appropriate measures will be taken by Scaleway. These measures may vary from a simple warning to termination of all services of said customer.
    </Message>
3. If your report is rejected, you will be informed of the reasons why by email.
    <Message type="note">
      - Note that massively reporting the same practices or content forces the Trust & Safety team to carry out unnecessary actions which have a negative impact on their work. As such, it is counterproductive to massively report the same practices or content. 
      - We would like to remind you that it is important to remain courteous when communicating with the Trust & Safety team. The team will not process any reports containing offensive, vulgar or threatening language.
