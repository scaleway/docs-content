**Quandela** is a European leader in photonic quantum computing. Their technology relies on manipulating light (single photons) through linear optical components to perform quantum calculations.

Unlike superconducting qubits or cold atoms, Quandela's photonic approach uses "qumodes" and photons that circulate in optical circuits at room temperature (although emitters and detectors require cooling). This offers a promising path towards a modular and scalable quantum computer.

To control these processors (QPUs) and run advanced simulations, Quandela develops **Perceval**, a reference open-source SDK.

## Accessing Quandela via Perceval

**Perceval** is the open-source software framework created by Quandela for linear optical quantum computing. It provides a simple and powerful object-oriented API to:

* **Design** linear optical circuits (Beam Splitters, Phase Shifters, etc.).
* **Simulate** photon behavior (ideal or noisy simulation).
* **Execute** algorithms on various backends: local simulators, high-performance remote simulators (on GPU), or real photonic QPUs.

### 1. Prerequisites

To start using IQM resources, you will need:
* A Scaleway account with a valid **Project ID**.
* A Scaleway **API Key** (Secret Key).
* A Python environment with the `qiskit-scaleway` package installed.

### 2. Installation

To start using Perceval on your local machine (or within a Scaleway Instance), simply install the Python package:

```bash
pip install perceval-quandela
```

## 3. Accessing Quandela QPUs via Scaleway QaaS

Scaleway QaaS provides privileged access to Quandela's physical QPUs and high-performance emulators optimized for GPUs hardware.

Integration is done directly via the `perceval.providers.scaleway` module.

Here is a complete example to create a session, define a simple circuit, and run it.

```python
import perceval as pcvl
import perceval.providers.scaleway as scw

# The session handles resource allocation and billing
session = scw.Session(
    platform_name="QPU-ASCELLA-6PQ",  # Example of a Ascella photonic platform
    project_id="your-scaleway-project-id",
    token="your-scaleway-api-key"
)

try:
    # Starts the session (provisions the resource, as it is a real QPU without booking, you will be billing on circuit & shot count)
    session.start()

    # 3. Create the Remote Processor
    processor = session.build_remote_processor()

    # 4. Define the Circuit (Simple Example: Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference)
    # Using a 50:50 Beam Splitter (Hadamard)
    circuit = pcvl.Circuit(2) // pcvl.BS.H()

    processor.set_circuit(circuit)
    processor.with_input(pcvl.BasicState("|1,1>")) # Input: 1 photon in each mode
    processor.min_detected_photons_filter(2)       # Keep only 2-photon events

    # 5. Execution (Sampling)
    sampler = pcvl.algorithm.Sampler(processor, max_shots_per_call=10000)
    job = sampler.samples(1000) # Request 1000 shots

    print("Sampling results:")
    print(job['results'])

finally:
    session.stop() # Stops the session

### Session management

**Context Manager** (`with`): You can use `with scw.Session(...) as session`: to automatically handle starting and stopping the session, ensuring you don't forget to stop it.

**Persistence**: If you created a session via the Scaleway [console](console.scaleway.com), you can reconnect to it using its `deduplication_id` during initialization in your code.
