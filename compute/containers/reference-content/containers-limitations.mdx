## Quotas

The limits mentioned beforehand are technical limits. [Account quotas](/console/my-account/reference-content/account-quotas/#serverless-containers) are also applied depending on your account level. 

## Configuration Restrictions

In order to ensure the proper functioning of the product, we restrict the use of certain ports and environment variables

* Blocked port:
  * **25**: Due to potential abuse (SPAM), no outbound traffic is allowed through this port

* Forbidden custom ports
  Please don't make your containers listen on these ports which are used by our service.
  * 8008
	* 8012
	* 8013
	* 8022
	* 9090
	* 9091

* Reserved environment variables:
  * `PORT`: Port on which your server should listen to default is 8080
  * `SCW_*`: Reserved for product configuration (for example: token validation)
