The Serverless Functions runtimes are the environment in which your code runs.
We currently support three languages:
* NodeJs
* Python 
* Go

## Runtime lifecycle

New runtimes are added periodically, based on user demand.

| Status               | Description                                                                                                                        |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Beta                 | The runtime has just been released, users can test it and provide feedback, but it is not yet suitable for production environment. |
| General Availability | The runtime is available to be used in a production environment.                                                                   |

When runtimes are no longer supported, they pass through different phases:

| Status               | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Deprecated           | The runtime is still available, but a warning announcing the upcoming End Of Service displays when a new function is created.                                                          |
| End Of Service (EOS) | It is no longer possible to create a new function with this runtime; however, functions that already use it can still be updated. A message with the date of End of Life is displayed. |
| End Of Life (EOL)    | Functions that use this runtime will still be working, but it is no more possible to update them.                                                                                      |
