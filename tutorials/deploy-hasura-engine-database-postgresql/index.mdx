## Hasura GraphQL engine - Overview

The [Hasura GraphQL Engine](https://hasura.io) is a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) server and provides developers with realtime GraphQL APIs for Postgres applications. The application allows you to configure webhook triggers on database events and helps you build GraphQL apps backed by Postgres or incrementally move to GraphQL for existing applications using Postgres.

In this tutorial you will learn how to get started with Hasura GraphQL Engine using a pre-built Docker container on your local computer, linked to a managed [Scaleway Database for PostgreSQL](https://www.scaleway.com/en/database/).

## Linking Hasura GraphQL engine with a Database for PostgreSQL

Hasura provides a pre-configured [repository](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/stable/install-manifests) to deploy the application in a few and simple steps in a Docker container.

1. Download the Docker `docker-run.sh` script using `wget`.
    ```
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/stable/install-manifests/docker-run/docker-run.sh
    ```
2. The `run-docker.sh` script contains a sample Docker command to run in it. Open the script in a text editor and modify the database URL and network configuration in the script.
    ```bash
    #! /bin/bash
    docker run -d -p 8080:8080 \
          -e HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@hostname:port/dbname \
          -e HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_CONSOLE=true \
          hasura/graphql-engine:latest
    ```
    Replace the part `postgres://username:password@hostname:port/dbname` with the login credentials of your managed PostgreSQL database for the `HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL` variable.

    <Message type="note">
      If your password contains special characters (e.g. #, %, $, @, etc.), you need to [URL encode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding#Percent-encoding_reserved_characters) them in the `HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL` environment variable (e.g. `%40` for @).
    </Message>

    You can find the credentials of your database in your Scaleway Console in the Database section:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-database_credentials.webp" alt="" />

    The modified file should look like the following example:

    ```
    #! /bin/bash
    docker run -d -p 8080:8080 \
          -e HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL=postgres://hasura:p4ssw0rd@195.154.69.220:21568/hasura \
          -e HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_CONSOLE=true \
          hasura/graphql-engine:latest
    ```
3. Make the script executable and run the modified script to start Hasura GraphQL Engine:
    ```
    ./docker-run.sh
    ```

  Docker will download the container and start it.
4. Check if the container is running using the `docker ps` command:
    ```bash
    docker ps
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                          COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
    01fd79964ade        hasura/graphql-engine:latest   "graphql-engine serve"   6 seconds ago       Up 5 seconds        0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp   dreamy_lalande
    ```
5. Open the Hasura Console in your web browser by pointing it to [`http://localhost:8080/console`](http://localhost:8080/console). The console displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-hasura_console.webp" alt="" />

    Your Hasura GraphQL Engine is ready now.

## Making your first GraphQL query

1. Create a table from the Hasura console. Click **Data** -> **Create table** and create two new tables called `author` and `book` with the following columns to create a simply library indexing system:
    ```graphql
    author (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      name TEXT
    )

    book (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      title TEXT,
      summary TEXT,
      rating INT,
      author_id INT
    )
    ```
    For example the configuration of the `book` table:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-hasura_add_table.webp" alt="" />
2. Add some Sample data by clicking on the **Insert Row** tab on each of the newly created tables.
3. Query the data using GraphQL commands from the GraphQL tab in the console.

    For example, to query all rows in the `book` table:
    ```
    {
      book {
        id
        title
        summary
        rating
        author_id
      }
    }
    ```

    You will see an output like the following:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-hasura_query.webp" alt="" />

    To add a new author to the database, run the following command:
    ```
    mutation add_author {
      insert_author(
        objects: [
          { name: "Jarrad Higgins" }
        ]
      ) {
        affected_rows
        returning {
          id
          name
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    In the output the ID (here `5`) of the new author displays:
    ```
    {
      "data": {
        "insert_author": {
          "affected_rows": 1,
          "returning": [
            {
              "id": 5,
              "name": "Jarrad Higgins"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## Conclusion

You now have deployed Hasura GraphQL Engine using Docker, connected it to a Scaleway [Database for PostgreSQL](https://www.scaleway.com/en/database/) and made your first steps with GraphQL.
