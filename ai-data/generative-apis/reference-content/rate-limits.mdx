## What are the limits ?

<Message type="important">
  This service has no rate limits while in closed beta. Limits will be set at a later stage.
</Message>

Any given model served through Scaleway Generative APIs will ultimately get limited by:
- Tokens per minute
- Queries per second

We welcome feedback from early testers to set proper rates according to future use.

## Why do we set rate limits?

These limits will serve to safeguard against abuse or misuse of Scaleway Generative APIs, helping to ensure fair access to the API with consistent performance.
