A Read Replica is a live copy of a Database Instance that behaves like an Instance, but that only allows read-only connections. The replica mirrors the data of the primary Database node and any changes made are replicated to the replica asynchronously.

Read replicas allow you to scale your Database Instance for read-heavy database workloads. They can also be used for business intelligence workloads.

## How to create a Read Replica

1. Click **Document Databases** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Scroll down to the **Read Replica** section.
4. Click **Create Read Replica**. A pop-up displays.
5. Select the network type. Two types are available:

    - **Public network** - Resources in a public network are publicly visible by default. The default Access Control List (ACL) settings allow anybody to connect to resources in your network. You can restrict access by configuring ACLs in the Allowed IPs section.
    - **Private Networks** - Private Networks allow you to create virtual Private Networks for your Databases, enabling them to communicate in an isolated network without the need for a public IP address. If you select this option, you must select an existing Private Network to attach to your Read Replica.
    <Message type="note">
    Your private IP addresses are automatically allocated. They are managed via an IP Address Manager (IPAM). You can retrieve them on the Private Network tab of your Database Instance. To allocate IPs manually, you can use the Scaleway API and CLI, or Terraform.

    <Message type="important">
    If you select **Public network**, you can [attach a Private Network](/managed-databases/document-database/how-to/manage-read-replica/#how-to-manage-private-networks) to your Read Replica after its creation. If you chose to attach your Read Replica to a Private Network, you will not be able to add a Public Network to the same Read Replica later via the Scaleway console. You can, however, use the [Managed Databases API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/managed-database-postgre-mysql/) to do so via a command line or Terraform.

6. Click **Create Read Replica**. A list of your Read Replicas displays.
    <Message type="important">
    Read Replicas have the same node types as the main node. For example, if your main node is of the DB-GP-S type, so is your Read Replica. The Replica also inherits the main node's configuration. The data of your main node is fully replicated in the Read Replica.

    <Message type="note">
      The time it takes to create the Read Replica depends on the volume of data being replicated.
