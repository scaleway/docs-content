There are some cases when a Private Network's private DNS or DHCP may not work 'out of the box' for attached resources. Read on to find out how to fix these problems.

## Basic steps to try first

- Make sure that [DHCP is activated](/network/vpc/how-to/activate-dhcp/) on your Private Network.
- Ensure that you have tried [detaching/reattaching](/network/vpc/troubleshooting/resource-attached-no-ip/#no-ip-address-is-displayed-but-i-have-activated-dhcp) the affected resources from/to the Private Network, particularly if they are older resources or you have [changed their name](/network/vpc/how-to/attach-resources-to-pn/#how-to-access-a-resource-on-a-private-network-via-its-hostname-dns).

## Resources with a dot in their hostname

Issues may arise with internal addressing if you give your resource a name that includes a dot (`.`). Try renaming your resource to a name that does not include a dot, then detach/reattach it to the Private Network in order to update DNS.

## Private Networks with a name that is also a TLD

See our [dedicated document](/network/vpc/troubleshooting/pn-name/) for a full explanation of this problem, and suggested solutions.

## Distributions running Network Manager

Private DNS should work out of the box for attached resources with Debian-based distributions, and for distributions using `systemd-resolved`, such as Ubuntu.

It does **not** work out of the box for Linux distributions using Network Manager, such as **RockyLinux**. If your resource is running RockyLinux, or another distribution using Network Manager, you should manually configure the system to use the nameserver `169.254.169.254`. You will then be able to resolve the name of your resources, as well as public domain names.

## DHCP is not working

DHCP should work out of the box for attached resources running any and all Linux distributions. However, when it comes to **ArchLinux**, we are aware of a problem when it comes to setting a Classless Static Route to our service IP address `169.254.169.254`.

In this case, if you are using `systemd-networkd` and do not have a route to our service IP address `169.254.169.254`, you should try updating and upgrading the packages on your system.

There is also a known [bug](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=867625) affecting **Debian Bullseye**, that prevents DHCP clients from correctly applying the default route. For this specific bug, we recommend using another distribution, such as **Debian Bookworm**.
