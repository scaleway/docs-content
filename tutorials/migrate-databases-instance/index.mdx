[Managed Database for PostgreSQL and MySQL](https://www.scaleway.com/en/database/) product provides reliable high-performance managed SQL database engines, both for PostgreSQL and MySQL. Using the service allows you to stay focused on the development of your applications and to benefit from Scaleway's expertise in the management of your database engines.

<Message type="note">
To migrate or import a database without an Instance, or using third-party tools, refer to [this procedure](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/api-cli/import-data-to-managed-postgresql-databases/).
</Message>

In this guide, you will learn how to migrate your existing databases on your Database Instances using an intermediate host.

This guide consists of two parts, depending on which database Engine your Instances are running:

- Database migration for PostgreSQL
- Database migration for MySQL

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- A [Database](https://www.scaleway.com/en/database/) for PostgreSQL or MySQL
- An [Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) available as an intermediate host for the migration

<Message type="important">
  If you run your database in a Private Network with no public endpoint, you have to create the intermediate Instance in your Private Network and attach a NAT gateway to be able to reach the public Internet, and then run the migration steps from there.

## Database migration for PostgreSQL

### Exporting the source database

1. Connect to your Instance using SSH:
    ```
    ssh root@<virtual_instance_ip>
    ```
2. Update the `apt` package cache and upgrade the software already installed on the system:
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
3. We use `pg_dump` to dump the content of the database to migrate. It is included in the package `postgresql-client-16`. Install it using apt:
    ```
    apt install postgresql-client-16
    ```
    <Message type="note">
      Ensure to use the latest version of the `postgresql-client` package when installing it. You can list all available versions of the package using the following command `apt list -a postgresql-client-*`
    </Message>
4. Dump the content of the originating database into a local SQL file on the Instance:
    ```
    pg_dump --host=<host> --port=<port> --username=<user> --dbname=<database_name> --file=<filename>.sql
    ```

  In the above command, replace the following values as follows:

  - `<host>`: The database server hosting the PostgreSQL database
  - `<port>`: The TCP port on which the database server is listening (by default `5432`)
  - `<user>`: The username used for the connection to the database server
  - `<database_name>`: The name of the database to export
  - `<filename>`: The name of the local file of the exported database

    <Message type="tip">
      If your database is running in a Docker container, the command to use will be:
      ```
      docker exec -it $CONTAINER_NAME pg_dump --username=<name> --dbname=<database_name> > <database>.sql
      ```
    </Message>

### Preparing the Database for PostgreSQL

<Message type="note">
  If you do not have a Database for PostgreSQL yet, [create a new one](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/create-a-database/) from your [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/rdb/instances).
</Message>

1. Enter the Database section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/rdb/instances).
2. Select your Database Instance from the list.
3. Click the **Managed Databases** tab, then on **+ Create Database** to create a new database in the instance.
4. Enter the name of the new database and click **Create Database** to confirm the operation:
    <Lightbox image={image} alt="" />
5. Click the **Users** tab to visualize a list of all your database users. To create a new user for your database, click **+ Add user**.
6. Click the **Permissions** tab and grant `All` permissions to your database for the user:
    <Lightbox image={image2} alt="" />
7. Click the **User Information** tab and enter the credentials for the new user. Confirm by clicking on **Create a user**:
    <Lightbox image={image3} alt="" />

### Importing the database

Once you have created both, the destination database and its users, import your data from the SQL file to your Database Instance by using the `psql` command-line tool.

1. Retrieve the database host and port from your Scaleway console. The **Endpoint** information is visible on your Database information page:
    <Lightbox image={image4} alt="" />
2. Use the `psql` command-line tool to import your database with the following command:
    ```
    psql --file=<filename>.sql --host=<managed_database_endpoint_ip> --port=<managed_database_endpoint_port> --username=<user> --dbname=<database_nme>
    ```

    In the above command, replace the following values as follows:
      - `<filename>`: The file name of the exported database
      - `<managed_database_endpoint_ip>`: The IP address of the Endpoint of your Database for PostgreSQL
      - `<managed_database_endpoint_port>`: The TCP port of the Endpoint of your Database Instance
      - `<user>`: The username for the Database
      - `<database_name>`: the name of the Database

## Database migration for MySQL

### Exporting the source database

1. Connect to your Instance using SSH:
    ```
    ssh root@<virtual_instance_ip>
    ```
2. Update the `apt` package cache and upgrade the software already installed on the system:
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
3. We use `mysqldump` to dump the content of the database to migrate. It is included in the package `mysql-client`. Install it using apt:
    ```
    apt install mysql-client
    ```
4. Dump the content of the originating database into a local SQL file on the Instance:
    ```
    mysqldump -P <port> -h <host> -u <user> -p <password> --opt <database_name> > <filename>.sql
    ```

    In the above command, replace the following values as follows:
      - `<port>`: The TCP port on which the database server is listening (by default `3306`)
      - `<host>`: The database server hosting the MySQL database
      - `<user>`: The username used for the connection to the database server
      - `<database_name>`: The name of the database to export
      - `<filename>`: The name of the local file of the exported database

4. Enter the name of the new database and click **Create Database** to confirm the operation:
    <Lightbox image={image5} alt="" />
5. Click the **Users** tab to visualize a list of all your database users. To create a new user for your database, click **+ Add user**.
6. Click the **Permissions** tab and grant `All` permissions to your database for the user:
    <Lightbox image={image6} alt="" />
7. Click the **User Information** tab and enter the credentials for the new user. Confirm by clicking on **Create a user**:
    <Lightbox image={image7} alt="" />

### Importing the database

Once you have created both, the destination database and its users, import your data from the SQL file to your Database Instance by using the `psql` command-line tool.

1. Retrieve the database host and port from your Scaleway console. The **Endpoint** information is visible on your Database information page:
    <Lightbox image={image8} alt="" />
2. Use the `mysql` command-line tool to import your database with the following command:
    ```bash
    mysql -P <managed_database_endpoint_port> -h <managed_database_endpoint_ip> -u <user> -p <password> <database_name> < <filename>.sql
    ```

    In the above command, replace the following values as follows:

    - `<managed_database_endpoint_port>`: The TCP port of the Endpoint of your Database Instance
    - `<managed_database_endpoint_ip>`: The IP address of the Endpoint of your Database for MySQL
    - `<user>`: The username for the Database
    - `<password>`: The password for the database user
    - `<database_name>`: The name of the Database
    - `<filename>`: The file name of the exported database

## Conclusion

You now have exported your existing PostgreSQL or MySQL database and imported it into a Scaleway Managed Datatabase Instance. To finish the migration process of your database, update the credentials and server information in the configuration files of your existing application. Once this information is updated, your application will use your database on Instances managed by Scaleway.
