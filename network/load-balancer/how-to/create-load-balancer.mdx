[Load Balancers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/load-balancer/) are highly available and fully-managed Instances which allow you to distribute your workload across your various servers. They ensure the scaling of all your applications while securing their continuous availability, even in the event of heavy traffic. Load Balancers are commonly used to improve the performance and reliability of web sites, applications, databases and other services.

## How to create a Load Balancer

2. Click **Create a Load Balancer**. The creation wizard displays.

3.  Complete the following steps in the wizard: 

    - Enter the Load Balancer **name** and **description**. Optionally, you can assign **tags** to help organize your Load Balancers.
    - Choose the **Availability Zone** in which your Load Balancer will be deployed geographically. Currently we provide the following Availability Zones:
      - `PAR1`: Paris 1, France.
      - `PAR2`: Paris 2, France (innovative and sustainable availability zone).
      - `AMS1`: Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
      - `WAW`: Warsaw, Poland.

    - Select an **IP address** that will be assigned to your Load Balancer. If left empty, a new IP address is allocated automatically.
    - Configure your [**Frontend**](/network/load-balancer/concepts/#frontends) and [**Backend**](/network/load-balancer/concepts/#backends).
      - **Frontend** rules include:
        - Frontend rule name
        - Port
      - **Backend** rules include:
        - Backend rule name
        - Protocol: TCP or HTTP
        - Port
        - Proxy
        - Health check type and Health check option.
        - Sticky session with the cookie name associated
        - Server IP

4. Click **Create a Load Balancer**.

## Load Balancer limitations

The following technical limitations apply when using the Load Balancers product:

- Your external [highly available IP address](/network/load-balancer/concepts#highly-available-ip-address) can only be IPv4. However it is possible to use IPv6 between IPv6 and backend servers.
- Each Load Balancer supports only one highly available frontend IP.

For further information, refer to the [Load Balancers FAQ](https://www.scaleway.com/en/faq/load-balancer/) and [API documentation](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/lb/zoned_api/).
