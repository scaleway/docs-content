Learn how to set up your own WordPress blog on a Scaleway Instance, supported by a robust MySQL 8 database. Scaleway Database for MySQL 8 offers up to 48 cores and 256 GB of RAM, ensuring optimal performance and reliability for your project.

WordPress, a PHP-based content management system, relies on MySQL to store its data. This tutorial will guide you through the technical steps of configuring WordPress on your Scaleway Instance, leveraging the power of MySQL 8.

With its customizable themes and extensive plugin ecosystem, WordPress provides unparalleled flexibility for developers and administrators to tailor the look and functionality of their blogs.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An [Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) running on Ubuntu Bionic Beaver (18.04 LTS) or Focal Fossa (20.04 LTS)
- A [Database](https://www.scaleway.com/en/database/) for MySQL v8

## Preparing the managed database

1. Go to the [Database section](https://console.scaleway.com/rdb/instances) of your Scaleway console and choose your Database Instance from the list:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-db_list.webp" alt="" />
2. Click the **Managed Databases** tab. A list of your existing databases displays. Click **+ Create Database** to create a new database:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-new_db_1.webp" alt="" />
3. Enter a name for your new database (for example, `wordpress`) and confirm by clicking on **Create Database**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-new_db_2.webp" alt="" />

### Securing the managed database

<Message type="important">
  This is an advanced feature and may make your Database unavailable. Be careful when using it.
</Message>

1. Click the **Allowed IPs** tab to see the list of allowed IPs:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-db_allowed_ips.webp" alt="" />
2. Click **Delete** to delete the default rule (`0.0.0.0/0 Allow All`).
3. Click **Add IP** and enter the IP of your Instance in CIDR notation (for example: `51.15.123.234/32`).
4. Confirm by clicking the **Add IP** button.

## Preparing the Instance

To host WordPress on our Instance, we need to install the required software on it. In this tutorial, we will use the Apache web server with PHP 7.4 to host our blog.

1. Connect to your Instance using [SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).
    ```
    ssh root@your_instance_ip
    ```
2. Update the `apt` package manager and upgrade the software already installed on the machine to make sure you have installed the latest upgrades and security patches:
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
3. Install the Apache web server and PHP:
    ```
    apt install apache2 libapache2-mod-php  php-common php-mysql php-curl php-json php-mbstring php-xml php-zip php-gd php-soap php-ssh2 php-tokenizer
    ```

## Downloading and installing WordPress

1. Download the latest WordPress release using `wget`:
    ```
    wget -c http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
    ```
2. Unpack the downloaded file using the following `tar` command:
    ```
    tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz
    ```
3. Move the content of the `wordpress` folder to a directory under the document root for Apache by creating a new folder for your blog (i.e. `blog.example.com` if you want to host your blog at _https://blog.example.com/_).
    ```
    cp -R wordpress /var/www/html/blog.example.com
    ```
4. Configure the ownership and file permissions on the blog directory. To make sure your blog works as expected, the directory should be owned by the Apache2 user and group called `www-data`.
    ```
    chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/blog.example.com
    chmod -R 775 /var/www/html/blog.example.com
    ```
5. Enter the blog directory and create a `wp-config.php` file by copying the example file shipped with the application.
    ```
    cd /var/www/html/blog.example.com
    cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
    ```
6. Open the configuration file in a text editor (for example, `nano`) and edit the MySQL server configuration as follows:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-managed_database_wp_config.webp" alt="" />

    Edit the hostname for your Database in the form `database_ip_address:database_port`, for example: `51.15.151.53:6241`.

    Save the file and exit `nano`.
7. Create an Apache configuration file for your new blog by opening it in a text editor, we use `nano` again:
    ```
    nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/blog.example.com.conf
    ```
    Copy and paste the following content into the file, then save it and quit the text editor:
    ```
    <VirtualHost *:80>
      ServerName blog.example.com
      ServerAdmin webmaster@blog.example.com
      DocumentRoot /var/www/html/blog.example.com
      ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
      CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
    </VirtualHost>
    ```
8. Test the Apache configuration file for syntax errors.
    ```
    apache2ctl -t
    ```
9. If no errors appear, enable the new site and reload Apache2 to activate the configuration:
    ```
    a2ensite blog.example.com
    systemctl reload apache2.service
    ```

## Securing the connection using TLS

By default, HTTP is a plain text protocol and does not use any encryption. To secure the connection between the client and the server, we are going to use the [TLS protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) using a certificate issued by the [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate authority. We are going to use a tool, called `certbot` which manages the configuration of the Apache2 web server, the certificate creation, and renewal of it. [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) is developed and maintained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation [EFF](https://www.eff.org/).

1. Install the required dependencies to prepare the system.
    ```
    apt install software-properties-common
    add-apt-repository universe
    apt update
    ```
2. Install `certbot` using the `apt` package manager.
    ```
    apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache
    ```
3. Run `certbot` to configure the Apache2 web server and request the certificate for your domain name.
    ```
    certbot --apache
    ```
    Answer the prompts.

    IMPORTANT NOTES:
    - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
      /etc/letsencrypt/live/blog.example.com/fullchain.pem
      Your key file has been saved at:
      /etc/letsencrypt/live/blog.example.com/privkey.pem
      Your cert will expire on 2020-09-21. To obtain a new or tweaked
      version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot again
      with the "certonly" option. To non-interactively renew *all* of
      your certificates, run "certbot renew"
    - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
      configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
      secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
      also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
      making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
    - If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:

      Donating to EFF:                    https://eff.org/donate-le
    ```

You have now successfully requested a TLS certificate for your blog. The connection between your visitors and the server is encrypted and secured.

## Configuring WordPress

Now, as WordPress is successfully installed and connections between your users and the server are using a secure HTTPS connection, it is time to finally configure your blog.

1. Open your web browser and type your blog's URL in the address bar of your web browser (for example: `https://blog.example.com`).
2. The WordPress installation wizard displays. Choose the desired language for your blog from the list and click **Continue**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-wp_install_1.webp" alt="" />
3. Enter the details of your new blog, such as the title, choose a name for the admin user, and set a secret password. Then click **Install WordPress** to complete the installation of your blog:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-wp_install_2.webp" alt="" />
4. You can now log in to your blog and write your first articles, or configure the look and feel by installing additional themes and modules.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-wp_install_3.webp" alt="" />

You have installed and configured your blog using a powerful Scaleway Database for MySQL 8, in which all your blog's content and information is stored.
