Scaleway's Transactional Email service allows users to send automated emails triggered by specific actions like account notifications, password resets, and order confirmations. This service is optimized for high-volume email sending, ensuring fast and reliable delivery of critical messages to end users.

The service is built on scalable infrastructure capable of handling substantial email volumes. However, sending capacities are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, depending on factors such as:

- Usage patterns
- Sender reputation
- Adherence to best practices

New users may face stricter initial limits, while well-known customers can benefit from higher limits, potentially sending up to millions of emails. These quotas are subject to validation by the Scaleway support team.

<Message type="important">
  Customers must adhere to industry standards and our [General Terms of Services](https://www-uploads.scaleway.com/General_Terms_of_Services_v17072024_45d4879c08.pdf), including compliance with [Scaleway's anti-spam policy](https://tem.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/antispam_policy.pdf). Failure to comply may result in temporary or permanent restrictions to the service.
