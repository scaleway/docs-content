Serverless Jobs can be deployed and managed using several tools. This page aims at helping you find the right tool for your use case.

<Message type="tip">
  You can find examples using all the deployment methods shown on this page in our [Serverless Examples repository](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-examples/).

## Scaleway console

The [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) is the easiest way to get started.

The console allows you to easily [create a job definition](/serverless/jobs/how-to/create-job-from-scaleway-registry/) and track your job runs. You can also monitor your jobs using [Scaleway Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/quickstart/).

## Terraform

You can easily integrate Serverless Jobs to your infrastructure as code, via our [Terraform provider and resources](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/scaleway/scaleway/latest/docs/resources/job_definition/).

## API

The [Scaleway HTTP API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/) lets you manage your Serverless resources via HTTP calls.

The HTTP API can be useful when integrating jobs management into your automated tasks, continuous integration, and more custom use cases.

## CLI

The [Scaleway CLI](/developer-tools/scaleway-cli/quickstart/) is a simple command line interface that allows you to create, update, delete and list your Serverless Jobs.

The dedicated documentation is available in the [Scaleway CLI repository](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/).

Below is an example of using the CLI to deploy a job:

```
scw jobs definition create name=testjob cpu-limit=70 memory-limit=128 image-uri=docker.io/alpine:latest command=ls
```

## Scaleway SDKs

The Scaleway SDKs allow you to manage your resources directly using your favorite languages.

The available SDKs are:

- Go SDK ([documentation](/developer-tools/scaleway-sdk/go-sdk/) - [repository](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-sdk-go/))
- JS SDK ([documentation](/developer-tools/scaleway-sdk/js-sdk/) - [repository](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-sdk-js/))
- Python SDK ([documentation](/developer-tools/scaleway-sdk/python-sdk/) - [repository](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-sdk-python/))
