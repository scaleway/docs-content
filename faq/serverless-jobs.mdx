## Overview

### What is Serverless Jobs, and when should I use it?

Serverless Jobs allows you to run large-scale batch processing and computational workloads in a fully managed environment. If you have tasks like data processing, machine learning training jobs, simulations, or large-scale analytics that can be parallelized, Serverless Jobs helps you orchestrate and manage those workloads seamlessly.

### What types of workloads are best suited for Serverless Jobs?

Serverless Jobs is ideal for tasks such as data processing, analysis and various computational operations that can be executed in a non-interactive batch mode. You can execute short and long-running jobs.

### What is serverless computing, and how does it differ from traditional cloud hosting?

Serverless computing is a cloud execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of compute resources. Unlike traditional hosting models, you do not need to provision, scale, or maintain servers. Instead, you focus solely on writing and deploying your code, and the infrastructure scales automatically to meet demand.

### Why consider using Serverless Containers, Functions, or Jobs for my projects?

These services allow you to build highly scalable, event-driven, and pay-as-you-go solutions. Serverless Containers and Functions help you create applications and microservices without worrying about server management, while Serverless Jobs lets you run large-scale, parallel batch-processing tasks efficiently. This can lead to faster development cycles, reduced operational overhead, and cost savings.

## Billing

### How am I billed for Serverless Jobs?

#### Principles

Serverless Jobs are billed on a pay-as-you-go basis, strictly on resource consumption (Memory and CPU).

* **Memory consumption:** The memory consumption is obtained by multiplying the memory tier chosen by the job run duration.
* **vCPU consumption:** The vCPU consumption is obtained by multiplying the vCPU tier chosen by the job run duration.
* **Ephemeral storage:** Is free of charge, the maximum value of ephemeral storage depends on the memory value.

#### Prices

* **Memory consumption:** €0.10 per 100 000 GB-s, and we provide a **400 000 GB-s free tier** per account and per month.

    | Memory   | Price per second  |

|--------------------------- |------------------|
| Monthly duration           | 432 000 s (120h) |
| Amount of memory allocated | 2048 MB          |
| Amount of vCPU allocated   | 1120 mvCPU       |
| Free tier                  | Yes              |

##### Price calculation

* **Memory consumption**
    * *Allocated Memory conversion:* 2048 MB = 2 GB
    * *Resource consumption:* 432 000 s * 2 GB = 864 000 GB-s
    * *Free tier:* 400 000 GB-s
    * *Billed resources:* 864 000 - 400 000 = 464 000 GB-s
    * *Cost:* 464 000 * €0.0000010 = **€0.47**
* **vCPU consumption**
    * *Allocated vCPU conversion:* 1120 mvCPU = 1.12 vCPU
    * *Resource consumption:* 432 000 s * 1.12 vCPU =  483 840 vCPU-s
    * *Free tier:* 200 000 vCPU-s
    * *Billed resources:* 483 840 - 200 000 = 283 840 vCPU-s
    * *Cost:* 283 840 * €0.0000100 = **€2.84**

**Monthly Cost: €3,31**

## Resources and performance

### How do I integrate my serverless solutions with other Scaleway services?

Integration is straightforward. Serverless Functions and Containers can be triggered by events from [Queues](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#queues) and [Topics and Events](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#topics-and-events), and can easily communicate with services like [Managed Databases](/managed-databases/) or [Serverless databases](/serverless/sql-databases/). [Serverless Jobs](/serverless/jobs/) can pull data from [Object Storage](/storage/object), or output processed results into a database. With managed connectors, APIs, and built-in integrations, linking to the broader Scaleway ecosystem is seamless.

### Can I update Serverless Jobs resources (vCPU and RAM) at any time?

Yes, resources of your Job Definition can be updated at any time.

Ongoing job runs will keep using the resources defined when they started.

## Usage

### How can I monitor the activity of my Serverless Jobs?

Serverless Jobs are integrated with [Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/quickstart/), Scaleway's Observability service. Cockpit allows you to [see all the logs and metrics associated with your job runs](/serverless/jobs/concepts/#job-run). Additionally, each job run has a status that provides you with real-time information on your job's execution.

### Can I cancel or modify a Serverless Job after it has started?

An ongoing Serverless Job can be interrupted during its execution from the **Job runs** section of a job's **Overview** tab. Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/serverless/jobs/how-to/stop-job/) for more information.

### How can I automate the deployment and management of Scaleway Serverless Jobs?

Scaleway Serverless Jobs is part of the Scaleway ecosystem, it can therefore be driven using the [Scaleway CLI](/developer-tools/scaleway-cli/quickstart/), the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/), and other [developer tools](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/). Our serverless ecosystem offers a lot of possibilities with event-driven architectures, and integrations with more products of the Scaleway ecosystem are under active development.

### Can I run multiple Serverless Jobs at the same time?

When starting a job, you can use contextual options to define the number of jobs to execute at the same time. Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/serverless/jobs/how-to/run-job/#how-to-run-a-job-with-contextual-options) for more information.

### Where should I host my jobs images for deployment?

<Macro id="container-registry-note" />

### How can I copy an image from an external registry to Scaleway Container Registry?

You can copy an image from an external registry by [logging in to the Scaleway Container Registry](/containers/container-registry/how-to/connect-docker-cli/) using the Docker CLI, and by copying the image as shown below:

```sh
docker pull alpine:latest
docker tag alpine:latest rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/example/alpine:latest
docker push rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/example/alpine:latest
```

Alternatively, you can use tools such as [Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo) to copy the image:

```sh
skopeo login rg.fr-par.scw.cloud -u nologin -p $SCW_SECRET_KEY
skopeo copy --override-os linux docker://docker.io/alpine:latest docker://rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/example/alpine:latest
```

### Can I securely use sensitive information with Serverless Jobs?

Yes, you can use sensitive data such as API secret keys, passwords, TLS/SSL certificates, or tokens. Serverless Jobs seamlessly integrates with [Secret Manager](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/), which allows you to securely reference sensitive information within your jobs. Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/serverless/jobs/how-to/reference-secret-in-job/) for more information.

## Network and storage

### How can I configure access to a Private Network?

Scaleway Serverless Jobs does not currently support Scaleway VPC or Private Networks, though this feature is under development.

To add network restrictions on your resource, consult the [list of prefixes used at Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/en/peering/). Serverless resources do not have dedicated or predictable IP addresses.

### How can I store data in my Serverless resource?

Serverless resources are by default [stateless](/serverless/functions/concepts/#stateless), local storage is ephemeral.

For some use cases, such as saving analysis results, exporting data etc., it can be important to save data. Serverless resources can be connected to other resources from the Scaleway ecosystem for this purpose:

#### Databases

* [Serverless Databases](/serverless/sql-databases/): Go full serverless and take the complexity out of PostgreSQL database operations.
* [Managed MySQL / PostgreSQL](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/): Ensure scalability of your infrastructure and storage with our new generation of Managed Databases designed to scale on-demand according to your needs.
* [Managed MongoDB®](/managed-databases/mongodb/): Get the best of MongoDB® and Scaleway in one database.

#### Storage

* [Object Storage](/storage/object/): Multi-AZ resilient object storage service ensuring high availability for your data.
* [Scaleway Glacier](/storage/object/): Our outstanding Cold Storage class to secure long-term object storage. Ideal for deep archived data.
