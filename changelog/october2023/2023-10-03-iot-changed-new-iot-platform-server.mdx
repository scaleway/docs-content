The Certificate Authority used by all mqtt tls connections to the IoT Hub has been updated !

As described in our [Certificate Authority update](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/managed-services/iot-hub/reference-content/certificate/) document you can now stop using the `migration.iot.fr-par.scw.cloud` endpoint.
