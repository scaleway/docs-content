The [folder](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#folder) creation process slightly differs depending on whether you are using Secret Manager for the first time or not. This page explains how to create a [folder](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#folder) for the first time using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) and how to create a folder if you have already created resources in Secret Manager.
