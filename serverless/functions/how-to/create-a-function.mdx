This page shows you how to deploy a [function](/serverless/functions/concepts/#function) using the Scaleway console.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created a functions namespace](/serverless/functions/how-to/create-a-functions-namespace/)
</Message>

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.

2. Click the functions namespace in which you want to create your function.

3. Click **+ Create function**. The function creation wizard displays.

4. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 
    - Choose your function's runtime.
    - Select **Deploy "Hello world"** if you want to deploy a basic function, **Inline code editor** to enter your own function code, or **Upload a ZIP** to import a [packaged function](/serverless/functions/how-to/package-function-dependencies-in-zip/). 
    - If you used the code editor, enter the **handler** of your function.
    - Enter a **name** or use the automatically generated one. The name can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes.
    - Enter a **description** (optional).
    - Select the **resources** to allocate to your function.
    - Configure the **scaling** of your function. 
    <Message type="tip">
      Define a minimum of 1 instance or more to avoid cold starts.
    </Message>
5. Click **+ Advanced options** and complete the following steps: 
    - Define any **environment variables** you want to inject into your function. For each environment variable, click **+ Add variable** and enter the key/value pair.
    - Set secret environment variables (optional). **Secrets** are environment variables which are injected into your function and stored securely, but not displayed in the console after initial validation. Add a **key** and a **value**.
    - Set the desired **privacy policy** for your function. This defines whether a function can be executed anonymously (**public**) or only via an authentication mechanism provided by the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-functions/#authentication) (**private**).
    - Set the desired timeout for your function.
    <Message type="note">
      [Triggers](/serverless/functions/concepts/#trigger) can no longer be added from this screen. For more information, refer to the [How to add a trigger to a function](/serverless/functions/how-to/add-trigger-to-a-function/) documentation.
    </Message>
    - Verify the **estimated cost**.
6. Click **Create function** to finish.
