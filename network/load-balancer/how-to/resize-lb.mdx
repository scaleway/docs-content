You can resize an existing Scaleway Load Balancer if you want to switch to a different [offer type](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/network/). This will allow you to access higher bandwidth, better performance and potentially multi-cloud backend servers. Resizing a Load Balancer can be done via the Scaleway console by following the steps below. 

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a Load Balancer](/network/load-balancer/how-to/create-load-balancer/)

1. Click **Load Balancers** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu.

2. Click the Load Balancer you want to resize. Its **Overview** dashboard displays.

3. Scroll down to the **Resize** panel, and click **Resize**. A pop-up displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-resize-lb.webp" alt="A pop up window shows a Resize Load Balancer screen, with a dropdown menu to choose a Load Balancer type, and a warning that resizing might take a few seconds during which time the Load Balancer might be inaccessible." />

4. Choose the Load Balancer type that you want to resize to. For full details of available types, their features and the cost, see our [pricing page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/network/#load-balancer).

    <Message type="note">
    You can resize your Load Balancer upwards or downwards, to either a superior or inferior offer type. Note that if you have a Load Balancer type that includes multi-cloud backend servers, and you have already attached such backend servers, you will not be able to resize your Load Balancer to a non-multi-cloud offer unless you detach the external backend servers from your Load Balancer backend.

5. Click **Resize Load Balancer**.

Your Load Balancer is resized, and you are returned to its **Overview** tab.
