This page shows you how to send [metrics](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#metric) and [logs](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#logs) to your [Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#cockpit). The Observability Cockpit provides you with 2 Remote Write endpoints to be able to push metrics and logs. You can push metrics with any `Prometheus Remote Write` compatible agent such as the [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/) or [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) agents.
You can push logs with any Loki compatible agent such as the [Promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/), [Fluentd](https://docs.fluentd.org/), [Fluent Bit](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/) or [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/introduction.html) agents.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
  - You have [activated your Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/how-to/activate-cockpit/)
</Message>

1. Click **Cockpit** in the Observability section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Cockpit** overview page displays.
2. [Create a token](/observability/cockpit/how-to/create-token).
3. Check **Metrics** and **Logs** for the **Push** permission when selecting your token permissions, so your token can write logs and metrics.

    <Message type="important">
     Once you have created your token, your secret key displays only once. Make sure you copy and save it before you exit the page.
    </Message>
4. Configure your applications to send metrics and logs to your Cockpit [endpoints](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#endpoints), using your newly-created token for authentication.

    <Message type="important">
     - The `Prometheus Remote Write` endpoint to push your metrics is the following: `https://metrics.prd.obs.fr-par.scw.cloud/api/v1/push`
     - The Remote Write endpoint to push your logs is the following: `https://logs.prd.obs.fr-par.scw.cloud/loki/api/v1/push`

## Example: send Python logs to your Scaleway Cockpit on a new logs dashboard

First we need [logging_loki](https://pypi.org/project/python-logging-loki/). You can install it using the command `pip install python-logging-loki`

```
snippet_python_to_scw_cockpit.py

import logging
import logging_loki


handler = logging_loki.LokiHandler(
    url="https://logs.prd.obs.fr-par.scw.cloud/loki/api/v1/push", 
    tags={"job": "logs_from_python"},
    auth=("api_key", "YOUR_COCKPIT_API_KEY_WITH_PUSH_LOGS_AUTHORIZATION"),
    version="1",
)

logger = logging.getLogger("my-first-python-logger")
logger.addHandler(handler)
logger.error(
    "Logging a python error with Scaleway cockpit example", 
    extra={"tags": {"service": "my-service"}},
    )
```

<Message type="tip">
  On Loki Scaleway API, you can POST with bearer token authorization, or POST directly `https://api_key:YOUR_COCKPIT_API_KEY@logs.prd.obs.fr-par.scw.cloud/loki/api/v1/push`.

Python logs are sent to your Cockpit from the Scaleway Loki API. Now, we need to retrieve them on  the Scaleway Cockpit with Grafana:

* We choose a [simple logs dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/13639-logs-app/) for this example on Grafana Dashoards (Grafana Dashboard ID `13639`).
* On Scaleway Cockpit, choose "Dashboards", "Import", "Import via grafana.com" and load url or Grafana Dashboard id directly, here : id 13639
* On your new Dashboard, you can view log line from Python snippet. Congratulation, no more complexity !

</Concept>

5. [Log in to your Grafana account](/observability/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards).
6. Create your [Grafana dashboard](/observability/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards) and start monitoring your data.
