## Embeddings models

### Sentence-t5-xxl
The Sentence-T5-XXL model represents a significant evolution in sentence embeddings, building on the robust foundation of the Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) architecture.
Designed for performance in various language processing tasks, Sentence-T5-XXL leverages the strengths of T5's encoder-decoder structure to generate high-dimensional vectors that encapsulate rich semantic information.
This model has been meticulously tuned for tasks such as text classification, semantic similarity, and clustering, making it a useful tool in the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) framework. It excels in sentence similarity tasks, but its performance in semantic search tasks is less optimal.
