## Acknowledgement flag (ACKs)  

Are [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) flags used to indicate that a packet was received successfully.

</Concept>

<Concept opened>

## Allowed IPs

Access control list (ACL) rules [define permissions for remote access to a Database Instance](/databases/databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/manage-allowed-ip-addresses/). A rule consists of an IP address or an IP range.

</Concept>

## Cluster 

A Redis™ cluster consists of a set of primary and secondary nodes. The cluster nodes use hash partitioning to split the keyspace into 16,384 key slots. Each master of the cluster is responsible for a subset of those slots. Each secondary node replicates the data of one of the primary ones.

</Concept>

<Concept opened>

## Cluster mode

Each Managed Database for Redis™ cluster consists of three compute Instances hosting each a primary node and a secondary node for one of the other nodes. If one of the primary nodes fails, the remaining nodes hold a vote and elect one of the remaining secondary nodes as the new primary node. When the failing node rejoins the cluster, it automatically becomes a secondary node and begins to replicate the data of another primary node. 

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Endpoint

A point of connection to a database. The endpoint is associated with an IPv4 address and a port, and contains the information of whether the endpoint is read-write or not.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## High availability

Is an option that allows you to create a secondary server, with an up-to-date replica of the database. If the primary server fails for any reason, the secondary can take over requests, reducing downtime.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Horizontal Scaling

Feature that allows you to increase the size of your Managed Database for Redis™  infrastructure by adding more nodes to your Database Instance to increase your number of endpoints and distribute cache. 

</Concept>

<Concept>

## In-memory Database 

A database management system primarily build upon memory. Data is managed and stored within the main memory of an Instance. This allows the optimization of request speed and the improvement of application performance. 

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Managed database

Compared to traditional database management, which requires customers to provision their infrastructure and resources to manage their databases, managed databases offer the user access to a Database Instance without setting up the hardware or configuring the software.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Max Memory

Is a configuration directive used to set the maximum amount of memory Redis™ can use for a data set. You can set this value via the Scaleway Console or by configuring the `available_settings` via API.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Region

A region is represented as a Geographical area such as France (Paris: `fr-par`), the Netherlands (Amsterdam: `nl-ams`) or Poland (Warsaw: `pl-waw`).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## TCP Keep alive 

Packet that is sent by a device when the [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) connection on a routing device has been idle for too long. The packet is sent to the peer with only the [Acknowledgement flag (ACK)](#acknowledgement-flag-(acks)) turned on. 

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Vertical Scaling  

Feature that allows you to increase the size of your Managed Database for Redis™  by upgrading to a bigger node type to allow increased traffic for the same endpoint. 

</Concept>
