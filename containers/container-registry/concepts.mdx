## Container Registry

Scaleway Container Registry is a fully-managed mutualised Container Registry, designed to facilitate the storage, management and deployment of [container images](#container-image). The service simplifies the development-to-production workflow, as there is no need to operate your own Container Registry or to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

## Container image

A container image is a file that includes all the requirements and instructions of a complete and executable version of an application. When running, it becomes one or multiple instances of that application. You can [pull the image](/containers/container-registry/how-to/pull-images/), [edit its settings](/containers/container-registry/how-to/manage-image-privacy-settings/), [view its versions](/containers/container-registry/how-to/display-image-versions/) or [delete it](/containers/container-registry/how-to/delete-image/).

## Docker

Docker is a tool that makes it easy to manage container images. You can [use Docker from your local computer](/containers/container-registry/how-to/connect-docker-cli/) to enable you to [push and pull images to and from your Scaleway Container Registry](/containers/container-registry/how-to/push-images/).

## Image privacy policies

Image privacy policies specify whether everyone has the right to pull the image or not. When an image is set to public, anyone is able to pull it. [Set your image to private](/containers/container-registry/how-to/manage-image-privacy-settings/) if you want to restrict access. You can also specify that an image should inherit its privacy policy from its namespace.

## Namespace

Namespaces allow you to [manage your Container Registry](/containers/container-registry/how-to/create-namespace/) in a simple, clear and human-readable way. A namespace is a collection of container images, each bearing the unique identifier of that namespace (each namespace must have a globally unique name). A namespace belongs to a user, who is responsible for configuring the push and pull permissions with [privacy policies](#namespace-privacy-policies).

## Namespace privacy policies

Namespace privacy policies specify whether everyone has the right to pull an image from the namespace or not. When an image is in a public namespace, anyone is able to pull it. [Set your namespace to private](/containers/container-registry/how-to/manage-namespace-privacy-policies/) if you want to restrict access.
