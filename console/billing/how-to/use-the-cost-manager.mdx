The Scaleway cost manager is a comprehensive tool to monitor and analyze cloud resource consumption and costs. It offers a clear and detailed view of consumption data, enabling you to accurately consolidate consumption for re-invoicing purposes.

2. Click the **Consumption** tab.
3. Scroll to **Cost Manager**.

    An overview of your Organization's consumption is displayed.

4. Filter the data by selecting the different categories in the drop-down, then click **Filter**.

    You can filter by:
      - **Period** - Currently you can filter by year.
      - **Category** - The product category (e.g. Compute, Storage, Containers). Each category corresponds to a different color in the consumption chart and in the detailed list.
          <Message type="note">
            If you are filtering by Product, you must first select the Product Category.
          </Message>
      - **Product** - The product itself. The consumption shown is the sum of all your products of the same type. For example, if you select **Instances**, the consumption chart will display the value referring to all Instances in your selected Project.
      - **Project** - One or all Projects in your Organization. Leave empty to select all at once.
