Three types of IQM QPUs are available at Scaleway:

## Garnet (20 Qubits)
Ideally suited for benchmarking standard gate-based algorithms and running small-scale variational circuits (VQE, QAOA). It is a robust and stable system, making it the perfect entry point for exploration.

## Sirius (24 Qubits)
This processor features a unique "star" topology. Currently, **16 qubits are fully operational** and exposed for computation. It is specifically interesting for testing algorithms that benefit from high connectivity centers, differing from standard grids.

## Emerald (54 Qubits)
IQM's latest generation processor. With **54 qubits**, Emerald crosses a significant threshold, allowing for the execution of circuits that are difficult to simulate classically (depending on depth). It is designed for advanced research, exploring Quantum Advantage, and running deep circuits.

## Hardware Comparison

The table below summarizes the key technical specifications and pricing models for each available QPU.
