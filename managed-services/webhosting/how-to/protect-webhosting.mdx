The [protected hosting](/managed-services/webhosting/concepts/#protected-hosting) feature is designed to prevent any accidental or unauthorized deletions of your Web Hosting plan. When enabled, this feature ensures that your Web Hosting plan cannot be deleted, providing an extra layer of protection against unintended disruptions. This is particularly useful for preventing errors, such as accidental cancellations during routine maintenance or management activities.
