VPC allows you to quickly and seamlessly secure all your application architecture's resources from external networks. Additionally, your infrastructure will benefit from improved resiliency as VPC is now regionalized across the Availability Zones by default.
- By default, each region will have at least one VPC. You can create more if needed
- Each VPC can have multiple Private Networks, each with its own distinct CIDR blocks
- VPC will now include a DHCP server for each Private Network
