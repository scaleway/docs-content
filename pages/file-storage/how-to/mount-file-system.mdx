This page explains how to mount a file system to one or several Scaleway Instances.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a file system](/file-system/how-to/create-file-system/)
- [Attached](/file-storage/how-to/attach-file-system/) a file system to one or several Instances

1. Click **File Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. A list of your file systems displays.

2. Click the name of the file system you want to mount. The **Overview** page displays.

3. From the **Mount** section of the **Overview** page, copy the mounting command:

    ```sh
    mount -t virtiofs <file_system_id> /mnt
    ```

4. Open a terminal and [connect via SSH to the Instances](/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/) you have [attached to your file system](/file-storage/how-to/attach-file-system/).

5. Run the previously copied mount command to mount your file system at the specified mount point (`/mnt` by default):

    ```sh
    mount -t virtiofs <file_system_id> /mnt
    ```

    <Message type="note">
    You can specify a different mount point by replacing `/mnt` by the desired directory.
    </Message>

Your file system is now mounted and accessible from the specified mount point in your Instance.
