By default, an SSH server is installed and configured on the nodes of your Kubernetes Kapsule cluster.
To improve the security of your Kapsule cluster, you can disable this SSH server on your nodes.

You can manage and edit the status of the SSH server of your nodes from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) or by using the [API](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/).
Here, we show you how to do it from the console.

## How to enable or disable SSH on the nodes of a pool

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu.
2. Click on the cluster you want to edit.
3. Click on the **Pools** tab.
   <Lightbox src="scaleway-kapsule_pools.webp" alt="" />
4. Click <Icon name="more"/> next to the pool you wish to update and click **Edit**.
5. Add the `ssh-enabled=false` tag to disable SSH or `ssh-enabled=true` to enable it. Make sure there is only one tag with the `ssh-enabled=` prefix.
6. Click **Update pool**.
7. Wait approximately 5 minutes until the tag is propagated to the nodes of your pool and the status of the SSH server of each node is updated.

  All Kubernetes Kapsule clusters **are delivered with a default security group**.<br />
  Clusters created before May 2023 allow inbound traffic to the cluster's nodes.<br /><br />
  However, starting from May 2023, each Kapsule cluster is delivered with a default security group that enforces an inbound `DROP ALL` policy. This means that **all incoming connections are blocked by default**.<br /><br />
  To utilize the pre-installed SSH server and access the nodes within the cluster, you have to manually [configure a custom rule](/compute/instances/how-to/use-security-groups/#how-to-edit-a-security-group) in your clusters' security group to allow incoming traffic on TCP port 22.

## How to know if this feature is available on the nodes of your cluster

1. Open a terminal program.
2. Run the following command into the terminal. Make sure you replace `path_to_your_kubeconfig` with the path to your kubeconfig file.
    ```bash
    KUBECONFIG=path_to_your_kubeconfig kubectl get nodes -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,"AGENT-VERSION":".metadata.annotations.k8s\.scaleway\.com/agent-version"
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      To find the kubeconfig of your Kapsule cluster, log into the Scaleway console and click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the side menu.
      A list of your Kubernetes clusters will display, click on the one you want to verify. In the Download kubeconfig section at the bottom of the page, click **Download file** to download the kubeconfig.

This feature is available on all nodes of your cluster if `AGENT-VERSION` is at least v1.0.0 for all your nodes.
    ```
    NAME                                             AGENT-VERSION
    scw-k8s-silly-cartwright-default-ca35b74a4b644   v1.0.0
    scw-k8s-silly-cartwright-default-ca978112ca1bb   v1.0.0
    ```
    <Message type="tip">
      If this feature is not available on a specific node of your cluster, try to replace it.
