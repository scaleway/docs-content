[Private Network](/network/vpc/concepts#private-networks) enable you to build a virtual Layer 2 network between your Scaleway resources, such as Instances, Elastic Metal servers and Database Instances, allowing them to communicate in an isolated and secure network. You can also opt to attach a [Public Gateway](/network/vpc/concepts#public-gateway) to your Private Networks to provide extra functionality including IP autoconfiguration and NAT. Each resource and Public Gateway can be connected to one or several Private Networks, letting you build your own network topologies.

Private Networks are a LAN-like layer 2 ethernet network. A new network interface with a unique media access control address (MAC address) is configured on each device in a Private Network.

## How to create a Private Network

1. Click **Private Networks** in the **VPC** section of the side menu.

2. Click the **Create a Private Network** button. The creation wizard displays.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-pn-creation-wiz.webp" alt="" />

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 

    - Enter a **Name** for your Private Network, or leave the randomly-generated name in place. Optionally, you can also add [tags](/network/vpc/concepts#tags) to help you organize your Private Networks. 
    - Choose an **Availability Zone**, which is the geographical region where your Private Network will be deployed. You can only add resources from this  same Availability Zone to the Private Network. 

4. Click **Create a Private Network** to finish. Your Private Network is created. You are taken back to the **Private Networks** dashboard, where your new Private Network is now displayed in the list.

## How to attach and detach resources to/from a Private Network

<Message type="note">

Some resources, including Managed Databases and Public Gateways, must be attached to Private Networks from their own sections of the console. See the separate documentation for [attaching Managed Databases to Private Networks](/storage/database/how-to/connect-database-private-network/), and for [attaching Public Gateways to Private Networks](#how-to-attach-and-detach-public-gateways-tofrom-a-private-network). Currently, only Instances and Elastic Metal servers can be attached to Private Networks from the VPC section of the console using the method below.

Remember that resources must be within the same Availability Zone as a Private Network in order to be attached to it.

1. Click **Private Networks** in the **VPC** section of the side menu.

2. Click the Private Network you want to add/remove resources to/from. Alternatively, click <Icon name="more" /> next to the Private Network in question and select **More Info** from the dropdown list. You are taken to the **Overview** page for that network.

3. Click the **Attached Resources** tab.

4. Use the dropdown menu to select a resource to add to your Private Network, then click **Add Resource**. Remember, only resources in the same Availability Zone as the Private Network will appear in the dropdown list. 

To **detach a resource**, use the <Icon name="unlink" /> icon next to the resource in question to remove it from your Private Network. Confirm this action when prompted by clicking **Detach this resource**.


## How to attach and detach Public Gateways to/from a Private Network

## How to delete a Private Network

<Message type="note">

  Prior to deleting a Private Network, resources attached to it must be [detached](/compute/instances/how-to/use-private-networks#how-to-detach-instances-from-a-private-network).

</Message>

1. Click **Private Networks** in the **VPC** section of the side menu.

3. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the Private Network you wish to delete, and select **Delete**. A pop up displays asking you to confirm the action.

3. Confirm by typing **DELETE** in the box, and clicking **Delete this Private Network**.

You are taken back to the **Private Networks** dashboard, where the network you just deleted no longer displays.
