## How to check the status of the RAID

1. Log into your server using SSH. 
2.  Run the following command to display the status of the RAID: 
    ```
    ssacli ctrl all show config
    ```

    An output as the following example displays: 

    ```
    Smart Array P420 in Slot 1                (sn: PACCRID1XXXXXX)

    array A (SATA, Unused Space: 0 MB)

        logicaldrive 1 (1.8 TB, RAID 1, OK)

        physicaldrive 1I:1:1 (port 1I:box 1:bay 1, SATA, 2 TB, OK)
        physicaldrive 1I:1:2 (port 1I:box 1:bay 2, SATA, 2 TB, OK)
    ```
3. Run the following commands to display the SMART values of the disks: 
    ```
    smartctl -a -d cciss,0 /dev/sg0
    ``` 

    Then run: 

    ```
    smartctl -a -d cciss,1 /dev/sg0
    ```

## How to check the battery state of a P420 RAID controller with cache and battery 

Run the following command to check the battery state of an HP SMART ARRAY P420 RAID controller: 

    ```
    ssacli ctrl all show config detail
    ```

    It resets the cache and battery of the controller:

    ```
    Total Cache Size: 256 MB
    Cache Backup Power Source: Batteries
    Battery/Capacitor Count: 1
    Battery/Capacitor Status: OK
    ```
