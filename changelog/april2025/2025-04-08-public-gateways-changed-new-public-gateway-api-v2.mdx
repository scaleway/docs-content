We have released a new [Public Gateways API v2](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/public-gateway/), which comes with a new security feature for SSH bastion: [Allowed IPs](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/public-gateways/concepts/#allowed-ips). This version also removes some old DHCP features that are now managed by the IPAM and the built-in DHCP of the Private Networks.

The API v1 is now deprecated and will be definitively removed by October 1, 2025. Public Gateways users are encouraged to migrate to the API v2.
