Scaleway’s Environmental Footprint Calculator now supports Apple silicon dedicated servers. 

You can now track the environmental impact of your Apple servers with the same level of transparency as Elastic Metal.

The estimated impact is now displayed directly on the order page. Monthly environmental reports, including CO₂ emissions and water usage, are also available.

Start tracking your impact today! Check out your environmental reports in the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).
