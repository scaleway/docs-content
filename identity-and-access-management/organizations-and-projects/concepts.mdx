## Default Project

Each [Organization](#organization) has at least one associated [Project](#project). Upon account creation, this Project is called **default**. The [Project name can be changed](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/change-project-name/) later. The default Project takes on the Organization ID. Therefore, the default status cannot be transferred to other Projects.

## Organization

An Organization is made of one or several [Projects](#project). When you create your Scaleway account, an Organization is automatically created, of which you are the Owner.

## Organization ID

The Organization ID identifies the [Organization](#organization) created with your account. It can be found on your [Organization dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/organization/settings), in the **Settings** tab.

## Project

A Project is a grouping of Scaleway [resources](#resource). Each Scaleway Organization comes with a default Project, and you can create new Projects if necessary. Projects are cross-region, meaning resources located in different [regions](/compute/instances/concepts/#region) can be grouped in one single Project. When grouping resources into different Projects, you can use [IAM](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#iam) to define custom access rights for each Project.

## Project dashboard

The Project dashboard can be viewed within the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/project). On this dashboard, you can see an overview of the Project's [resources](#resources), along with the Project's settings and credentials ([SSH keys](#ssh-key)).

## Resource

A Scaleway resource is either a product or a feature in the Scaleway Ecosystem. Examples of resources include Instances, Private Networks, Kubernetes Kapsule and Flexible IPs, to name a few.

## SSH key

An SSH key (**S**ecure **Sh**ell key) allows passwordless connection to an [Instance](/compute/instances/concepts/#instance). An SSH key is generated by creating an RSA key pair, consisting of two elements:

- An **identification key** (also known as a private key), which you must keep securely on the computer you want to connect from.
- A **public key** is uploaded to the Scaleway console, where it is displayed with a customizable name and a hash of its value, known as a fingerprint, to make it more identifiable. The private key is transferred to your Instance during the boot process.

The public key is kept in your Scaleway account and transferred to the Instance during the boot process, while the identification key is kept securely on your local computer. When connecting to the Instance via SSH, a trusted connection to the machine is established using the key pair.
