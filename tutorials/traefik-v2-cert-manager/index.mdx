## Traefik - Overview

[Traefik](https://containo.us/traefik/) (pronounced traffic) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and Load Balancer designed to make the deploying of microservices easy. Traefik integrates with any HTTP and TCP-based applications and every major cluster technology.

Our goal in this tutorial is to:

- Expose [Traefik 2](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/v2.2/) using a Scaleway Load Balancer
- Deploy a test application on our cluster
- Expose this test application through an ingress object, using [Traefik 2](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/v2.2/) (deployed by Kapsule)
- Expose this application securely (with `https` and [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), using [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager))

This tutorial is divided in two parts:
- First, we will check how to expose the Traefik 2 ingress controller shipped with `Kapsule` with a [Scaleway LoadBalancer](https://www.scaleway.com/en/load-balancer/).
- In the second part, we will deploy a test application expose it in http with a DNS managed by [Scaleway DNS](/network/domains-and-dns/concepts), then use `cert-manager` to create a Let's Encrypt certificate and expose this application securely in `https`.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).
  - You have [created a Kapsule cluster](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/) with an ingress controller (Traefik 2).
  - You have downloaded the corresponding [kubeconfig](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/edit-cluster/) file and [kubectl](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/connect-cluster-kubectl/) is configured and working.

## Deploying a Load Balancer using the Easy Deploy feature 

<Message type="important">
  You need a Kubernetes Kapsule Cluster deployed with Traefik 2 to follow this tutorial. To deploy your cluster with Traefik 2, use the [easy deploy feature](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/enable-easy-deploy/).
</Message>

1. Click the **Easy Deploy** tab on your clusters overview page. The Easy Deploy feature displays.
2. Click **Deploy an Application**. The application deployment wizard displays.
3. Select **Application Library**, type **Traefik** in the search bar and select the **Traefik 2 Ingress** application. 
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_choose_application.webp" alt="" />
4. Enter the name `traefik` for the application and type the `kube-system` namespace name.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_application_name.webp" alt="" />
5. Click **Deploy an application** to deploy the Load Balancer on your cluster.

## Creating a wildcard DNS record and pointing your domain name to the IP address

We will be using the new [DNS product](https://console.scaleway.com/domains/external), available on Scaleway, to create a wildcard record pointing to this IP address (the domain used in this tutorial will be "mytest.com"). A wildcard record (`*.mydomain.com`) allows you to point any sub-domain of your domain to the configured IP address.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-traefik_widlcard.webp" alt="" />

Verify that the domain is pointed to the IP address of your LoadBalancer:

```
$ host foobar.mytest.com
foobar.mytest.com has address 195.154.68.108
```

Your domain is now pointing to your LoadBalancer IP, you can resolve any of your subdomain with that IP.

## Deploying a test application

In this step, we deploy a test application called "tea coffee" which is only printing tea or coffee depending on the subpath you will reach.

1. Use `kubectl` to create the application
    ```
    $ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/main/examples/ingress-resources/complete-example/cafe.yaml
    ```
2. Create an associated ingress object pointing to teacoffee.mytest.com by creating and editing the file `ingress-teacoffee.yml` in your favorite text editor:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: cafe-ingress
    spec:
      rules:
        - host: teacoffee.mytest.com
          http:
            paths:
              - path: /tea
                pathType: Prefix
                backend:
                  service:
                    name: tea-svc
                    port:
                      number: 80
              - path: /coffee
                pathType: Prefix
                backend:
                  service:
                    name: coffee-svc
                    port:
                      number: 80
    ```
3. Run the following command to setup the configuration:
    ```
    $ kubectl create -f ingress-teacoffee.yml
    ingress.networking.k8s.io/cafe-ingress created
    ```
4. You can now use `curl` to send a HTTP request this URL. Traefik 2 is working correctly with your wildcard DNS in plain, unencrypted HTTP (web unsecure).
    ```
    $ curl teacoffee.mytest.com/tea
    Server address: 100.64.0.240:8080
    Server name: tea-69c99ff568-c2lc2
    Date: 29/Jun/2020:13:01:19 +0000
    URI: /tea
    Request ID: f3b7f1bcd5dd841d420236906146af9f
    ```
5. To proceed with the tutorial, delete the ingress object created. It will be replaced in future steps.
    ```
    $ kubectl delete ing cafe-ingress
    ```

## Deploying Cert Manager

Cert-manager is in charge of creating [Let's Encrypt](https://www.letsencrypt.org/) TLS certificates to make your website secure, to sum-up:

- Create an ingress object for a specific subdomain (for instance foobar.mytest.com)
- Let's Encrypt must be sure that the domain belongs to you. For this reason, Let's Encrypt requests a "challenge", in our case, an HTTP challenge. Meaning here that Let's Encrypt will try to reach `foobar.mytest.com`, and is able to see a specific hash on this page.
- Cert-manager is serving this page for you by creating an ingress object and using an HTTP server.
- When the challenge is ok, the certificate is created and added in a certificate object.
- You can then use this certificate object to serve your website securely (HTTPS).

<Message type="note">
  Any modification to the Traefik2 deployed by Kapsule may be overwritten by the reconciliation process, consider [installing it yourself](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/getting-started/install-traefik/) for a production usage.
</Message>

1. Modify the default Traefik 2 daemonset running on Kapsule to do that, add `--entrypoints.websecure.http.tls` in the cmd stanza.
    ```
    $ kubectl edit ds traefik -n kube-system
    daemonset.apps/traefik edited
    []
            - --global.checknewversion
            - --global.sendanonymoususage
            - --entryPoints.traefik.address=:9000
            - --entryPoints.web.address=:8000
            - --entryPoints.websecure.address=:8443
            - --entrypoints.websecure.http.tls
            - --api.dashboard=true
            - --ping=true
            - --providers.kubernetescrd
            - --providers.kubernetesingress
    []
    ```
2. Delete the existing Traefik pods in order to get the new arguments.
    ```
    $ kubectl -n kube-system delete pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=traefik
    ```
3. Use the command below to install cert-manager and its needed CRD ([Custom Resource Definitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)):
    ```
    $ kubectl apply --validate=false -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.7.2/cert-manager.yaml

## Creating the Let's Encrypt issuer

1. Create a cluster issuer that allow you to specify:
    - the Let's Encrypt server, if you want to replace the production environment with the staging one.
    - the mail used by Let's Encrypt to warn you about certificate expiration.

    Copy and paste the following configuration in the file `cluster-issuer.yaml` using your favorite text editor:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
    kind: ClusterIssuer
    metadata:
      name: letsencrypt-prod
    spec:
      acme:
        # You must replace this email address with your own.
        # Let's Encrypt will use this to contact you about expiring
        # certificates, and issues related to your account.
        email: mymail@test.com
        server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
        privateKeySecretRef:
          # Secret resource used to store the account's private key.
          name: issuer-account-key
        # Add a single challenge solver, HTTP01
        solvers:
          - http01:
              ingress:
                class: traefik
    ```
2. Use `kubectl` to apply the configuration:
    ```
    $ kubectl create -f cluster-issuer.yaml
    clusterissuer.cert-manager.io/letsencrypt-prod created
    ```

## Creating and using a Let's Encrypt certificate to serve your website in HTTPS

In this step you will create the Let's Encrypt certificate by specifying:

    - The secret name where the certificate will be stored.
    - The subdomain for which you want to create a certificate.
    - The issuer created before (letsencrypt-prod).

1. Create a edit a file `mycert.yaml` as follows:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
    kind: Certificate
    metadata:
      name: teacoffee-cert
      namespace: default
    spec:
      commonName: teacoffee.mytest.com
      secretName: teacoffee-cert
      dnsNames:
        - teacoffee.mytest.com
      issuerRef:
        name: letsencrypt-prod
        kind: ClusterIssuer
    ```
2. Apply the configuration using `kubectl`:
    ```
    $ kubectl create -f mycert.yaml
    certificate.cert-manager.io/teacoffee-cert created
    ```
3. Check the certificate has been correctly created (you should see "Ready" in the condition):
    ```
    $ kubectl describe certificate -n default teacoffee-cert
    Spec:
      Common Name:  teacoffee.mytest.org
      Dns Names:
        teacoffee.mytest.org
      Issuer Ref:
        Kind:       ClusterIssuer
        Name:       letsencrypt-prod
      Secret Name:  teacoffee-cert

      Normal  Issued     48s   cert-manager  Certificate issued successfully
    ```
4. Create a Standard Ingress, with TLS enabled (with the name of the secret created by the creation of the certificate, in our case: `teacoffee-cert`). To do so create file `mysite.yaml`, copy the following content into it and run kubectl with the collowing command: `kubectl create -f mysite.yaml`
    ```
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: testcoffee
      namespace: default
      annotations:
        traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.entrypoints: websecure
    spec:
      tls:
        - secretName: teacoffee-cert
      rules:
        - host: teacoffee.mytest.com
          http:
            paths:
              - path: /tea
                pathType: Prefix
                backend:
                  service:
                    name: tea-svc
                    port:
                      number: 80
              - path: /coffee
                pathType: Prefix
                backend:
                  service:
                    name: coffee-svc
                    port:
                      number: 80
    ```
5. Check your website is accessible in HTTPS:
    ```
    curl -v https://teacoffee.mytest.com/tea
    *   Trying 195.154.68.108...
    * TCP_NODELAY set
    * Connected to teacoffee.mytest.com (195.154.68.108) port 443 (#0)

    ```
6. Access the Traefik 2 dashboard by using this command:
    ```
    $ kubectl port-forward -n kube-system $(kubectl get pods -n kube-system --selector "app.kubernetes.io/name=traefik" --output=name | head -n 1) 9000:9000
    ```
7. You can then access the Traefik 2 dashboard with this address: `http://127.0.0.1:9000/dashboard/` (Note the trailing `/`.)
