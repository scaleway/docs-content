The regional Load Balancer API is now deprecated and is no longer maintained by Scaleway. From now on, the [zoned API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/load-balancer/zoned-api/) must be used instead.
With the exception of zoning, this API is identical to the previous version.
 
When using this API through Kapsule, Terraform, the SCW CLI or another official open source tool, a tool update is required.
 
If you encounter any problems with this migration, don't hesitate to contact us on the #load-balancer channel of the Scaleway Community Slack.
