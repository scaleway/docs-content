<Macro id="storage-bucket-policy" />

## How to apply a bucket policy

1. Create the `bucket-policy.json` file in your environment using a text editor, such as `nano` or `vim`. You can edit the contents of the configuration according to your preference. Refer to [Understanding bucket policies](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/) for more details about each string.
    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2023-04-17",
        "Id": "MyBucketPolicy",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "DelegateAccess",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": {
                    "SCW": "user_id:<USER_ID>"
                },
                "Action": [
                    "s3:ListBucket",
                    "s3:GetObject"
                ],
                "Resource": [
                    "<BUCKET_NAME>",
                    "<BUCKET_NAME>/*"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

      Each bucket can have only one bucket policy
    </Message>
2. Run the command below to apply the policy. Replace `<BUCKET_NAME>` with the name of your bucket.
    ```
    aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket <BUCKET_NAME> --policy file://bucket-policy.json
    ```

## How to import a copy of objects from a bucket in a different project

Import a copy of your objects in a bucket to another bucket using the [AWS-CLI](/storage/object/api-cli/object-storage-aws-cli/).

For more information, refer to our [Importing a copy of S3 Objects from one bucket to another](/storage/object/api-cli/import-copy/) documentation page.

## How to manage bucket permissions for IP addresses or ranges of IP

You can stipulate which IP addresses or IP ranges have access or permission to perform S3 operations on your buckets by creating a [bucket policy](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/) with the `IpAddress` or `NotIpAddress` conditions.

For more information, refer to our [Managing bucket permissions for IP addresses or ranges of IP](/storage/object/api-cli/manage-bucket-permissions-IP/) documentation page.
