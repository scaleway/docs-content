**Alpine Quantum Technologies (AQT)** is an Austrian quantum computing company spin-off from the University of Innsbruck. They specialize in **trapped-ion** quantum computers, a technology renowned for its exceptional gate fidelity and long coherence times.

Unlike superconducting qubits, which rely on printed circuits, AQT uses individual calcium ions confined in a vacuum trap as qubits. This approach allows for a unique feature: **all-to-all connectivity**. Any qubit can talk to any other qubit directly, simplifying circuit design and reducing the need for noisy SWAP gates.

On Scaleway QaaS, we provide a dedicated provider `qiskit-scaleway` that allows you to use standard Qiskit code to target AQT's hardware seamlessly.Refer to the [Qiskit Scaleway GitHub repository](https://github.com/scaleway/qiskit-scaleway) for more information.

## How to access AQT with Scaleway

Scaleway acts as a bridge, allowing you to run Qiskit circuits directly on AQT's machines hosted in Innsbruck, or on their digital twins (emulators) hosted on Scaleway's GPU clusters.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account with a valid **Project ID**.
- A Scaleway **API Key** (Secret Key).
- Python and `qiskit` installed on your local machine

1. Install the `qiskit-scaleway` provider. Refer to the [Qiskit Scaleway GitHub repository](https://github.com/scaleway/qiskit-scaleway) for more information.

    ```bash
    pip install qiskit-scaleway
    ```

3. Create a file with the following computation script. Replace `$SCW_PROJECT_ID` and `$SCW_SECRET_KEY` with your Scaleway Project ID and secret key.

    ```python
    from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
    from qiskit_scaleway import ScalewayProvider

    # 1. Connection credentials
    PROJECT_ID = "$SCW_PROJECT_ID"
    SECRET_KEY = "$SCW_SECRET_KEY"

    # 2. Initialize the Scaleway Provider
    provider = ScalewayProvider(
        project_id=PROJECT_ID,
        secret_key=SECRET_KEY
    )

    # 3. Select the Backend
    # - 'QPU-IBEX-12PQ' : The real hardware (Paid per shot + per circuit)
    # - 'EMU-IBEX-12PQ-L4' : The emulator (Digital Twin) running on GPU, billed per minute
    backend_name = "QPU-IBEX-12PQ"

    try:
        backend = provider.get_backend(backend_name)
        print(f"Connected to backend: {backend.name}")

        # 4. Create a Quantum Circuit (e.g., Bell State)
        # Note: AQT supports all-to-all connectivity, so you don't need to worry about coupling maps.
        max_qubits = 12 # Number of qubits in IBEX-Q1
        qc = QuantumCircuit(max_qubits)

        # Create a full entangled state between all qubits, e.g., a GHZ state
        qc.h(0)
        for i in range(1, max_qubits):
          qc.cx(i-1, i)

        qc.measure_all()

        # 5. No transpilation
        # Scaleway QaaS handles the transpilation server-side for you

        # 6. Execute the Job
        # Warning: On the real QPU, this line triggers billing.
        print("Submitting job...")
        job = backend.run(qc, shots=100) # IBEX-Q1 runs the circuit with 100 shots

        # 7. Retrieve Results
        result = job.result()
        print("Results:", result)

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
    ```
4. Save the script. In this example we save it as `aqt.py`.

5. Run the script.
    ```bash
    python ~/aqt.py
    ```

      AQT QPUs are billed in **pay-as-you-go**. You pay a fixed fee per circuit and a fee per shot. There is no need to reserve the QPU since jobs are processed via a shared queue. Refer to the [Quantum Computing information page](/quantum-computing/additional-content/quantum-computing-information) for more details on how emulation platforms and billing work.
