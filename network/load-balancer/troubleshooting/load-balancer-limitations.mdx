This page sets out some current limitations of Scaleway Load Balancer.

- A public Load Balancer must have an IPv4 address, it cannot only have an IPv6 address. However it is possible to allocate a public IPv6 address in addition to an IPv6 address. IPv6 is also supported between your Load Balancer and backend servers.
- Each Load Balancer supports only one public IPv4 and one IPv6 address at a time.

For further information, refer to the [Load Balancers How To](/network/load-balancer/how-to/), [Load Balancers FAQ](/faq/load-balancer/) and [API documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/load-balancer/zoned-api/).
