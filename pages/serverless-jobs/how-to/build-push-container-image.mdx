This page explains how to create a simple Dockerfile to containerize your applications for deployment using Scaleway Serverless Jobs.

## How to Write a Dockerfile

1. Create a file named `Dockerfile` in your project directory.

2. Add the following content to your Dockerfile, adjusting the base image and commands according to your application:

<Tabs id="dockerfile-examples">
<TabsTab label="Go">
```dockerfile
# Use the official Golang image to create a build artifact.
FROM golang:1.24-alpine AS builder

# Create the main.go file with the Go source code
RUN echo 'package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from Scaleway Serverless Jobs!")
}' > main.go

# Build the Go app
RUN go build -o main .

# Start a new stage from scratch
FROM alpine:latest

# Copy the Pre-built binary file from the previous stage
COPY --from=builder /app/main .

# Command to run the executable
CMD ["./main"]
```
</TabsTab>
<TabsTab label="Python">
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.13-slim

# Single-line Python script as entrypoint
CMD ["python", "-c", "print('Hello from Scaleway Serverless Jobs!')"]
```
</TabsTab>
<TabsTab label="Rust">
```dockerfile
FROM rust:1.86-slim

# Pre-compile a Rust binary during build
RUN echo 'fn main() { println!("Hello from Scaleway Serverless Jobs!"); }' > main.rs && \
    rustc main.rs

# Run the pre-compiled binary
CMD ["./main"]
```
</TabsTab>
</Tabs>

## How to build and push your image from your Dockerfile

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile.

2. Run the following command to build your Docker image:

    ```bash
    docker build -t my-application .
    ```

3. Run the command below to log in to your Scaleway account in the terminal. Make sure that you replace the placeholder values with your own.

    ```sh
    docker login rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/your-container-registry-namespace -u nologin --password-stdin <<< "$SCW_SECRET_KEY"
    ```

4. Tag your Docker image so it matches your Scaleway registry's format:

    ```sh
    docker tag my-application:latest rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/your-container-registry-namespace/my-application:latest
    ```

5. Push the Docker image to the Scaleway Container Registry:

    ```sh
    docker push rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/your-container-registry-namespace/my-application:latest
    ```

You can now access your container image from the [Scaleway Container Registry](https://console.scaleway.com/registry/namespaces), and [deploy a Serverless Job](/serverless-jobs/reference-content/deploy-job/) from this image.
