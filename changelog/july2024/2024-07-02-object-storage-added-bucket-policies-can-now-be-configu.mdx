Bucket policies can now be created, viewed and edited from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/). You can now see which buckets lack a policy, and get a centralized view of all your bucket policies.

Simple and intuitive access management reduces configuration errors and enhances security. Granting granular access to your Object Storage resources has never been easier with our user-friendly interface that allows you to configure both IAM and bucket policies.
