This page sets out some current limitations of Scaleway's VPC.

- VPC is currently only available in the Paris region.
- The only product currently available within the regional VPC is Private Networks.
- Up to 250 resources can be attached to a regional Private Network.
- A resource can be attached to up to 8 regional Private Networks.
- The following resource types can be attached to a regional Private Network:
  - Instances
  - Elastic Metal servers
  - Load Balancers
  - Public Gateways
  - Managed Databases for PostgreSQL and MySQL
- It is currently not possible to attach a resource to a regional Private Network from within that resource's own dashboard in the console. You must use the **VPC** dashboard of the console to attach resources to regional Private Networks.
