Scaleway Serverless Containers is fully integrated into [Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/quickstart/), and allows you to quickly access your logs and metrics. This page explains how to get started with Scaleway Cockpit to monitor your Serverless Containers.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a Serverless Container](serverless/containers/how-to/deploy-a-container-from-scaleway-container-registry/)

## How to activate your Cockpit

Scaleway Cockpit is activated by default if you have created [Scaleway resources integrated with Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-limitations/#product-integration-into-cockpit).

## How to access the Grafana dashboard

To view your Serverless Containers logs, use the Grafana dashboard which is accessible from the Scaleway console:
  - First you must create a user and their associated credentials (a username and password) for Grafana.
  - Then use these credentials to access the Grafana dashboard for all your Scaleway products, via the Scaleway console.

1. Create a Grafana user and retrieve their username and password by following [this procedure](/observability/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/).

2. From the Scaleway console [Cockpit overview page](https://console.scaleway.com/cockpit/overview/), click **Open dashboards** in the top right corner.

3. Enter your Grafana username and password to log in.

    You are directed to the Scaleway Cockpit dashboards homepage.

4. From the **Scaleway Dashboards** panel, select:
    - **Serverless Containers logs** to access the logs of your containers.
    - **Serverless Containers Overview** to access the metrics of your containers.

  You are directed to the selected dashboard. You can use the filters at the top of the page to refine the displayed information.

<Message type="note">
  You can also access your Serverless Containers logs and metrics from the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) via the **Logging** and **Metrics** tabs of a container.
