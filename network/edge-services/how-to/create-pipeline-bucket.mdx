Edge Services is an additional feature for Scaleway Load Balancers and Object Storage buckets, currently available in [Public Beta](https://www.scaleway.com/en/betas/).

Enabling Edge Services on your Object Storage bucket creates an Edge Services pipeline which brings you a number of possible benefits:

- Customize your bucket's endpoint using a subdomain of your own domain
- Add your own SSL/TLS certificate, safeguarded in [Scaleway Secret Manager](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/quickstart/), or generate a managed Let's Encrypt certificate, so your subdomain can serve content from your bucket over HTTPS
- Enhance performance by caching your stored objects, to be served directly by Edge Services from the cache
- Finely control your cached objects via purging (cache invalidation)

Read on to learn how to create an Edge Services pipeline by enabling Edge Services on your bucket.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)

## How to create an Edge Services pipeline

Edge Services is available as a feature on Object Storage buckets. You enable it on a bucket-by-bucket basis. When you enable Edge Services on a particular bucket, a [pipeline](/network/edge-services/concepts/#pipeline) is automatically created for that bucket.

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of your buckets displays.

2. Click the name of the bucket you want to enable Edge Services on.

3. Click the **Edge Services** tab.

4. Click **Enable Edge Services for free**.

    A pop-up informs you that your bucket will be exposed via Edge Services and that you can disable Edge Services at any time. Edge Services is free during the beta stage, and you will be notified before it becomes billable.

5. Click **Enable Edge Services** to confirm.

    Edge Services is enabled on your bucket, and a pipeline is automatically created. Various features are now visible on the Edge Services tab, ready to be configured.

    <Message type="important">

    Your bucket's [visibility](/storage/object/concepts/#visibility) can be set to **private**, but any objects within it that you want to expose via Edge Services must be set to [**public** visibility](/storage/object/how-to/manage-object-visibility/). However, in the case that you are using Edge Services with bucket website (see below), objects can remain private.

    <Message type="important">
    Note the following important information about using Edge Services with the [bucket website](/storage/object/how-to/use-bucket-website/) feature:
    - **If you want to use bucket website and Edge Services**: Ensure that you activate bucket website **before** you enable Edge Services. Avoid deactivating bucket website afterwards.<br /><br />
    - **If you do not want to use bucket website**: Simply enable Edge Services. Note however that if you activate bucket website after this, Edge Services will not be able to serve your bucket website URLs, and will continue to serve the regular bucket URLs.<br /><br />
    - **If you want to change your bucket website setting**: Disable Edge Services first, activate or deactivate bucket website as you wish, and then enable Edge Services. Edge Services will now pick up the new configuration, and will serve content from your bucket website URLS if bucket website is activated, or from your regular bucket URLs if bucket website is deactivated.

## How to access your bucket via Edge Services

Once you have enabled Edge Services on your bucket, you can access your bucket and its content via the following endpoints (replace `bucket-name` with the name of your bucket.)

| Endpoint                                | Where to find this endpoint in the console | Notes                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `https://bucket-name.s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud` | The **Bucket settings** tab                | Edge Services is bypassed when bucket is accessed via this endpoint  |
| `https://bucket-name.svc.edge.scw.cloud`  | The **Edge Services** tab                  | Edge Services serves bucket content when this endpoint is used |

The two endpoints shown above are available as standard. However, with Edge Services, you can also choose to configure a **custom domain** from which your bucket can be accessed. Read more about this in the [next section](TODO LINK).
