Multifactor authentication provides extra layers of security. In addition to your password (the first factor), other factors (such as TOTP and passkeys) are required to access your account.

You can enable Multifactor Authentication (MFA) on your Scaleway account for enhanced security. Even in the event of a leaked password, your account is protected.

Two MFA methods are available:
    - **One-time password (TOTP)** - method through which you access your account using a unique, time-based validation code generated by an app.
    - **Passkey** - secure authentication method that eliminates the need to create, manage, or remember passwords.

<Message type="important">
  If you are an account Owner, you can set up the two different MFA methods at the same time. We recommend you have at least one of the two MFA methods set up at a time, to keep your account safe.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)

## How to enable TOTP

To use TOTP on your account, you first need to download an authenticator tool. Once configured, TOTP apps display a constantly rotating set of codes to use with your different accounts when you are prompted for one during login. Popular TOTP apps include:
- [Authy](https://authy.com/download/)
- [FreeOTP](https://freeotp.github.io/)
- [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en&gl=US)

1. Download the app of your choice and install it onto your smartphone.
2. Go to your [Account Security](https://console.scaleway.com/settings/account/security) page.
    <Message type="important">
      If you are logged in as an [IAM Member](/iam/concepts/#member), click **Credentials** in your user overview page.
    </Message>
3. Click **Set up TOTP**, in the **Multifactor authentication** section. A pop-up displays.
3. Enter the code shown on the pop-up into your MFA app, or scan the QR code into your app.
  Your app sets up MFA for your Scaleway account and displays a 6-digit code.
4. Enter the 6-digit authentication code given by your app into the box, then click **Submit**.
5. Download or copy the backup codes shown, and store them in a safe place. These codes will be the only way to regain access to your account without your TOTP app.

TOTP MFA is now enabled on your account.

Next time you log in to your Scaleway account, you will be prompted for a TOTP code. Use your TOTP app to get the code and enter it in the Scaleway console.

### How to update TOTP

If you no longer have access to the device in which you set up your TOTP, you can update your TOTP information and set it up via the Scaleway console.

<Requirements />

- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Enabled TOTP](#how-to-enable-totp) on your account

<Message type="important">
  If you have lost access to your account and are not able to log in, follow the [Cannot log into my account](/account/troubleshooting/cannot-log-into-my-account/) troubleshooting procedure.
</Message>

1. Go to your [Account Security](https://console.scaleway.com/settings/account/security) page.
2. Click **Update TOTP**, in the **Multifactor authentication** section. A pop-up displays.
3. Enter the code shown on the pop-up into your MFA app, or scan the QR code into your app.
  Your app sets up TOTP for your Scaleway account and displays a 6-digit code.
4. Enter the 6-digit code given by your app into the pop-up box, and click **Submit**.
5. Download or copy the backup codes shown, and store them in a safe place. These codes will be the only way to regain access to your account without your TOTP app.

### How to delete TOTP

1. Go to your [Account Security](https://console.scaleway.com/settings/account/security) page.
2. Click **Delete TOTP**, in the **Multifactor authentication** section. A pop-up displays.
3. Type **DELETE** in the box to confirm, then click **Delete TOTP**.

TOTP is now disabled on your account.

<Message type="important">
  If you delete TOTP as a Member of an Organization that has MFA enforced, you will need to re-enable it before the Organization's [grace period](/iam/how-to/comply-with-sec-requirements-member/#grace-period) ends, otherwise your Member account will be locked.

## How to enable passkeys

A passkey is a passwordless authentication method that allows you to securely log in to apps and websites through public-key cryptography. Passkeys at Scaleway are supported by the WebAuthn standard.

When you enable a passkey, your authenticator tool generates a public/private key pair. The private key stays securely on your device while the public key is sent to Scaleway.

When you log in, the Scaleway sends a challenge to your device. Your device uses the private key to sign the challenge. Scaleway verifies the response using the public key.

  This MFA method is currently not available for IAM Members.

- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status
- Set up a [password manager](/iam/concepts/#password-manager) on your device

1. Go to your [Account Security](https://console.scaleway.com/settings/account/security) page.
2. Click **+ Add passkey**, in the **Multifactor authentication** section. A pop-up displays.
3. Enter the passkey name you configured in your password manager.
4. Click **Start**. Your password manager will be called and a pop-up might appear in your browser.
5. Follow your password manager's instructions to confirm and finish setting up the passkey.
    If the process was successful, you will see a pop-up affirming that the **passkey was added**.
6. Click **Close**.

You see a list of your passkeys.

### How to delete a passkey

1. Go to your [Account Security](https://console.scaleway.com/settings/account/security) page.
2. Click <Icon name="delete" />, next to the passkey you want to delete in the **Multifactor authentication** section. A pop-up displays.
3. Type **DELETE** in the box to confirm, then click **Delete passkey**.

TOTP is now disabled on your account.

<Message type="important">
  Keep in mind that the passkey will be deleted from your Scaleway account only. You may need to manually delete it from your authenticator service account.
