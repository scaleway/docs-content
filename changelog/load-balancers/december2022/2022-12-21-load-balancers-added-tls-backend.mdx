Load Balancers now let you explicitly configure encryption at the backend. You can enable TLS for connections to servers in a given backend and select the port number without being restricted to 443. The new "Verify Certificate" setting lets you specify whether the Load Balancer should check the server's certificate before establishing the connection.  
You can use these settings to configure SSL bridging, having the Load Balancer terminate encrypted connections at the frontend, decrypt traffic, and re-encrypt it when forwarding it to backend servers.
