The clone feature allows you to create a new Database Instance from an existing one. The clone includes all existing databases, users and permissions. You can create a clone on a Database Instance bigger than your current one.

## How to clone a Database Instance

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Scroll down to the **Clone** section.
4. Click **Clone Database Instance**. A pop-up displays.
5. Enter a name for your database or leave the default name suggested by the Scaleway console.
6. Select a node type. You can keep the same node type, or upgrade to a bigger one.

7. Click **Clone Database Instance**.

<Message type="important">

  The source Database Instance remains available during the cloning process in **Backing up mode**. Some actions are not available during this time.

  The time it takes to clone a Database Instance with local storage depends on the size of the database. For Database Instances with Block Storage the cloning process is slightly faster.
