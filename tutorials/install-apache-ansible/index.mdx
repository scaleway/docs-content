## Configuring Ansible for Apache

Once Ansible is installed, we need to specify Ansible which hosts to talk to. We could use the default host file located in `/etc/ansible/hosts` however, that is applied globally across your system and often requires admin permissions. To make things easier we will use a local hosts file.

Ansible always looks for an `ansible.cfg` file in the local directory that it is being run from, and if found will override the global configuration with local values.

1. Create a new directory that we will use through the example
    ```
    mkdir ansible-apache
    ```
2. Move to this newly created directory
    ```
    cd ~/ansible-apache/
    ```
3. Create a new file `ansible.cfg`
    ```
    nano ansible.cfg
    ```
4. Add in the hostfile configuration option with the value of hosts, within the [defaults] group. Copy the following into the ansible.cfg file.
    ```
    [defaults]
    hostfile = hosts
    ```
5. Create a hosts file and open it for editing
    ```
    nano hosts
    ```
6. Copy the following into the hosts file. Make sure you replace the `secondary_server_ip` with the secondary server's hostname or IP address.
    <Message type="note">
      The `ansible_ssh_user=username` component is optional if you are running Ansible as the same user as the target host.
    </Message>

    ```
    [apache]
    secondary_server_ip ansible_ssh_user=username
    ```
    ```
    secondary_server_ip | SUCCESS => {
        "changed": false,
        "ping": "pong"
    }
    ```

You can also use `echo`, a Unix command that echoes a string to the terminal

```
ansible apache -m command -a "/bin/echo hello world"
```
```
secondary_server_ip | success | rc=0 >>
hello world
```

## Creating a Playbook

Playbooks are Ansible's configuration, deployment, and orchestration language. They can describe a policy you want your remote systems to enforce. In short, playbooks are designed to be human-readable and they are used to manage configurations of and deployments to remote machines.

1. Create a file called `apache.yml`.
    ```
    nano apache.yml
    ```
2. Copy the following text into the file:
    ```
      - hosts: apache
        tasks:
          - name: run echo command
            command: /bin/echo hello world
    ```
3. Run the playbook we just created.
    ```
    ansible-playbook apache.yml
    ```
    ```
    PLAY [apache] *******************************************************************

    TASK [Gathering Facts] **********************************************************
    Enter passphrase for key '/root/.ssh/id_rsa':
    ok: [secondary_server_ip]

    TASK [run echo command] *********************************************************
    changed: [secondary_server_ip]

    PLAY RECAP **********************************************************************
    secondary_server_ip               : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0
    ```

Playbooks do not return the production of the module, so unlike the direct command we used above, we cannot see if `hello world` was indeed printed out.

## Installing Apache

1. Update the apache.yml playbook with the apt module instead of the command module.
    ```
    nano apache.yml
    ```
2. If there is existing content in the `apache.yml` file, delete the content and replace it with the following.
    ```
      ---
      - hosts: apache
        sudo: yes
        tasks:
          - name: install apache2
            apt: name=apache2 update_cache=yes state=latest
    ```
3. Run the Playbook. The `--ask-sudo-pass` flag prompts the sudo password on the secondary Ansible server.
    ```
    ansible-playbook apache.yml --ask-sudo-pass
    ```
    ```
    PLAY [apache] ******************************************************************

    TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************
    ok: [secondary_server_ip]

    TASK [install apache2] *********************************************************

    changed: [secondary_server_ip]

    PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
    secondary_server_ip               : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0
    ```

If you visit your secondary server's hostname or IP address in your browser, an Apache2 Ubuntu default page should display as follows

## Configuring Apache Modules

Now that Apache is installed, we need to enable [modules to be used by Apache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Apache_modules).

Let us make sure that the mod_rewrite module is enabled for Apache using the `apache2_module` module and a task handler to restart apache2.

The apache2_module module takes two actions:

- **name:** The name of the module to enable, such as write.
- **attribute:** Either present or away, being on if the module needs to be enabled or not.

1. Open apache.yml for editing
    ```
    nano apache.yml
    ```
2. Paste the following content. As we need to restart apache2 after the module is enabled we need to use a task handler.
    ```
      ---
      - hosts: apache
        sudo: yes
        tasks:
          - name: install apache2
            apt: name=apache2 update_cache=yes state=latest

          - name: enabled mod_rewrite
            apache2_module: name=rewrite state=present
            notify:
              - restart apache2

        handlers:
          - name: restart apache2
            service: name=apache2 state=restarted
    ```

    The way handlers work is that a task can be told to notify a handler when it has changed, and the handler only runs when the task has been changed. To do this we need to add the notify option into the `apache2_module` task, and then we can use the service module to restart apache2 in a handler.
3. Run the Playbook
    ```
    ansible-playbook apache.yml --ask-sudo-pass
    ```
    ```
    PLAY [apache] ******************************************************************

    TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************
    Enter passphrase for key '/root/.ssh/id_rsa':
    ok: [secondary_server_ip]

    TASK [install apache2] *********************************************************
    ok: [secondary_server_ip]

    TASK [enabled mod_rewrite] *****************************************************
    changed: [secondary_server_ip]

    RUNNING HANDLER [restart apache2] **********************************************
    changed: [secondary_server_ip]

    PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
    secondary_server_ip               : ok=4    changed=2    unreachable=0    failed=0
    ```

If you run the command again, the restart task is not listed anymore.

## Configuring Apache Options

Now that we have a working Apache installation, with our demanded modules turned on, we need to configure Apache. By default Apache listens on port 80 for all HTTP traffic.

For the sake of the tutorial, let us assume that we want Apache to listen on port 8081 instead. We will use the `lineinfile` module to tune the configuration options.

If you want to know more about the lineinfile module refer to the [Ansible Documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/lineinfile_module.html)

1. Open the `apache.yml` file for editing
    ```
    nano apache.yml
    ```
2. Amend the additional lines so that the file looks like this:
    ```
    ---
    - hosts: apache
      sudo: yes
      tasks:
        - name: install apache2
          apt: name=apache2 update_cache=yes state=latest

        - name: enabled mod_rewrite
          apache2_module: name=rewrite state=present
          notify:
            - restart apache2

        - name: apache2 listen on port 8081
          lineinfile: dest=/etc/apache2/ports.conf regexp="^Listen 80" line="Listen 8081" state=present
          notify:
            - restart apache2

        - name: apache2 virtualhost on port 8081
          lineinfile: dest=/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf regexp="^<VirtualHost \*:80>" line="<VirtualHost *:8081>" state=present
          notify:
            - restart apache2

      handlers:
        - name: restart apache2
          service: name=apache2 state=restarted
    ```
3. Run the Playbook
    ```
    ansible-playbook apache.yml --ask-sudo-pass
    ```

Once Ansible is fully set up, you can visit your web browser on port 8081 (rather than port 80). In most web browsers, this can be easily achieved by adding :port onto the end of the URL: http://public_ip_adress:8081/
