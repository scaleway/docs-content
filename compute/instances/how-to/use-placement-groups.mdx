[Placement groups](/compute/instances/concepts/#placement-groups) allow you to specify that you want certain Instances to either run on different physical hypervisors for maximum availability, or else as physically close together as possible for minimum latency.

3. Click **Create placement group**. The creation wizard displays.
4. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 
    - Enter a **Name** for your placement group, or leave the randomly-generated name in place. 
    - Choose an **Availability Zone**, which is the geographical region where your placement group will be created. You can only add Instances from this same Availability Zone to the placement group.
    - Choose the **Type** of placement group:
      - **Low Latency** groups ensure that Instances are located as close as possible to each other
      - **Maximum Availability** groups ensure that Instances do not run on the same physical hypervisor 
    - Choose the **Policy** for your placement group:
      - **Enforced** means that, if the group cannot be applied, only Instances on hypervisors matching the group settings will boot
      - **Optional** ensures that the settings of the placement group are applied wherever possible, but lets Instances boot on hypervisors that do not match the group policy.
    - Add **Instances** to the placement group.
