This page shows you how to set up the connection to a Serverless SQL Database using the Scaleway Console.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have created a [Serverless SQL Database](/serverless/sql-databases/how-to/create-a-database/)
</Message>

## How to set up credentials

1. From the **Overview** tab of your database, click the **Set up credentials** button. The setup wizard displays.

2. Select the [principal](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#principal) to connect to the database:

    - Yourself, as an [IAM user](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#user).

    - An [application](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#application) that you [previously created](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-application/) in the IAM section of the console.

    <Message type="note">
        Refer to the [IAM documentation](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/overview/) for more information on identities and access rights.
    </Message>

3. Set up the **connection string** or **connection parameters**:

    - If you already have a secret key, paste it in the connection text in place of the ``[INSERT_SECRET_KEY_HERE]`` placeholder.

    - If you do not have a secret key, click **Generate new secret key**.

4. Copy your connection string or parameter and store it securely.
