Scaleway allows you to choose between two types of accounts, Personal and Corporate. All users are given the possibility to select one or the other option when first signing up for a Scaleway account. If you signed up for a personal account and need to convert to a corporate one, follow these instructions.

<Message type="important">
 Switching to a corporate account is permanent. You will not be able to switch back to a personal account once the conversion to corporate is completed.
