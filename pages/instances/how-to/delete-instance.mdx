This page shows you how to delete an Instance.

<Message type="important">
  Deleting an Instance is an **irreversible action**. Any data stored on your Instance will be lost.
</Message>

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/)

## How to delete an Instance

1. Click **CPU & GPU Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The [Instances page](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) displays.
2. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the Instance you want to delete, and select **Delete** from the drop-down menu.
    A pop-up asks you to confirm the action.
3. Type **DELETE** to confirm your choice.
4. If your Instance has associated IPs or Block Storage volumes, you will be asked whether you want to delete them as well. Check the corresponding box to delete them along with your Instance.
5. Click **Delete Instance**.

    You are returned to the list of your Instances, where the Instance you deleted no longer appears.
