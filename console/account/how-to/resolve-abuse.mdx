Abuses are complaints regarding the use of Scaleway services for illegal behavior or hosting of illegal content. Abuse reports for the same issue on the same resource within a given time frame are grouped by case.

If you have been the subject of an abuse report, you are responsible for taking the appropriate security measures to solve the case. You must also prevent any further abuse from your resources to avoid your services being locked by Scaleway.

However, Scaleway reserves the right to immediately suspend the infringing services if it is deemed necessary, and proportionate to keep Scaleway’s network safe or to abide by legal requirements.

If you encounter any issue with the resolution of an abuse, ensure that you contact the abuse team by opening a [support ticket](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create) directly from your console.

    If you are the subject of an abuse report for hosting illegal content (including copyright), we urge you to delete the content from the Scaleway infrastructure promptly.
    * For other types of abuse, here are some suggestions to help you to correct them:
        * Backup all your server data
        * Check for recent file changes
        * Check log files on your server
        * Check your PHP and cgi files for any backdoors
        * Check if any software you use is vulnerable, and update them
        * Reinstall your server after backup
        * Change passwords of your server
        * Backup your website and your email data
        * Check for recent files changes, security holes in common CMS you may use (Joomla, SPIP, WordPress…)
        * Check version in some software you may use on your computer (email client, FTP client)
        * Change your FTP and email passwords
    If you do not know how to solve the problem, you can contact our [outsourcing partners(https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/outsourcing/)] or reach out to Scaleway’s abuse team by opening a ticket directly from your Scaleway console account.

4. The case will be closed at the end of its lifetime by Scaleway’s abuse team, and so will the abuse tickets forming the case.
   If you receive more abuse reports on the same resource within the case lifetime, it means that you did not take the appropriate measures to prevent further abuse from happening. 
   Therefore, we recommend you take additional actions and contact our support team if you need assistance. Failure to take appropriate measures to solve the case may result in the locking of your service as per our [Terms of Services](https://www.scaleway.com/en/contracts/) and the legal framework in force. 

In specific instances, the case will be closed automatically:
* abuse reports submitted by Scaleway’s abuse partners may be closed automatically after the automated locking of your services, if several complaints were received within the same case, or if Scaleway considers that the type of abuse reported requires immediate locking of your services.
* cases regarding security holes will be closed automatically. Refer to the description of the abuse in order to find more details on patches and updates available.
