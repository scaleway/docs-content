[Load Balancers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/load-balancer/) are highly available and fully-managed Instances which allow you to distribute your workload across your various servers. They ensure the scaling of all your applications while securing their continuous availability, even in the event of heavy traffic. Load Balancers are commonly used to improve the performance and reliability of websites, applications, databases and other services.

## How to create a Load Balancer

1. Click **Load Balancers** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. If you have not already created a Load Balancer, the product creation page is displayed. Otherwise, your list of existing Load Balancers displays.

2. Click **+ Create Load Balancer**. The creation wizard displays.

3. Enter a **name** for your Load Balancer. Optionally, you can also add a **description** and assign **tags** to help organize your Load Balancers.

4. Choose the **Availability Zone** in which your Load Balancer will be deployed geographically. Currently, we provide the following Availability Zones:
      - `PAR1`: Paris 1, France.
      - `PAR2`: Paris 2, France (innovative and sustainable Availability Zone).
      - `AMS1`: Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
      - `AMS2`: Amsterdam 2, The Netherlands.
      - `AMS3`: Amsterdam 3, The Netherlands.
      - `WAW1`: Warsaw, Poland.
      - `WAW2`: Warsaw, Poland.

5. Select a Load Balancer **type**, according to your needs in terms of **bandwidth** and whether you want to be able to attach backend servers from other cloud providers than Scaleway (**Multi-cloud provider**).

6. Select the **accessibility** of your Load Balancer. It can be either:
    - **Private**: A private Load Balancer will have no public IP address, and is only accessible from the Private Network(s) it is attached to. You can [attach your Load Balancer to a Private Network](/network/load-balancer/how-to/use-with-private-network/) after creation of the Load Balancer. [Read more about private Load Balancers](/network/load-balancer/concepts/#private-load-balancer).
    - **Public**: A public Load Balancer is accessible from the internet via its public IP address. You can either allocate a new IP, or select one of your existing IPs.

    Accessibility cannot be modified after creation of the Load Balancer.

7. Click **Create and add front and backend** to create your Load Balancer, and configure a frontend and backend for it.

## How to configure your frontend

<Lightbox src="scaleway-configure-frontend.webp" alt="" />

1. Enter a **name** for your frontend.

2. Enter a **port** number. The frontend will listen on this port, and forward the requests it receives from clients to the backend(s). Note that you cannot add an SSL certificate at this stage, but you can [add one after the creation of the Load Balancer](/network/load-balancer/how-to/add-certificate/). Similarly, you will be able to [enable HTTP/3](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/http2-http3/#configuring-your-load-balancer-for-http3) after adding a certificate.
