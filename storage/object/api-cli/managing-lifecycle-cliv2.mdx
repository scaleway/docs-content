[Scaleway Object Storage](/storage/object/concepts/#object-storage) is a service based on the S3 protocol. It allows you to store different types of objects (documents, images, videos, etc.) and to distribute them instantly, anywhere in the world. You can create and manage your Object Storage resources from the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/login), or via the [Scaleway Command Line Interface v2](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli#scaleway-cli-v2) that uses external tools such as `rclone`, `s3cmd` and `mc`. 

## Scaleway Command Line Interface Overview

[The Scaleway Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli) allows you to pilot your Scaleway infrastructure directly from your terminal, providing a faster way to administer and monitor your resources. Scaleway CLI is easy to set up and is an essential tool for operating efficiently in your cloud environment.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
  - You have generated your [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
  - You have downloaded and installed the [Scaleway CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli#scaleway-cli-v2)
  - You have downloaded [S3cmd](https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd), [rclone](https://rclone.org/downloads/) and [mc](https://github.com/minio/mc) s3 tools

## Configuring the CLI

1. Open a terminal and type the following command, to configure the Scaleway CLI on your machine:

    `scw init`

    If you have already configured the CLI, you will see a message like the following:

    ```
    Current config is located at /path/to/config.yaml
    access_key: <YOUR ACCESS KEY>
    secret_key: <YOUR SECRET KEY>
    default_organization_id: <YOUR ORGANIZATION ID>
    default_project_id: <YOUR PROJECT ID>
    default_region: <YOUR DEFAULT REGION, eg fr-par>
    default_zone: <YOUR DEFAULT ZONE, eg fr-par-1>

    Do you want to override the current config? (Y/n):
    ```
2. Type `n` and go directly to the [Creating a configuration file for the Scaleway CLI v2](#creating-a-configuration-file-for-the-scaleway-cliv2) step of this tutorial if you do not want to edit your configuration.

    If you have not yet configured the CLI, you will be guided through the configuration process via a series of questions:

    ```
    Enter a valid secret-key or an email
    ```
3. Enter either the email address for your account (you will then be asked for your password), or your [API Secret Key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/):
    ```
    To improve this tool we rely on diagnostic and usage data.
    Sending such data is optional and can be disabled at any time by running "scw config set send-telemetry=false".
    Do you want to send usage statistics and diagnostics? (Y/n):
    ```

    Type `y` or `n` and hit enter.

    ```
    To fully enjoy Scaleway CLI we recommend you install autocomplete support in your shell.
    Do you want to install autocomplete? (Y/n):
    ```
    Type `y` or `n` and hit enter.

    ```
    To enable autocomplete, scw needs to update your shell configuration.
    What type of shell are you using (default: zsh):
    ```
4. Hit enter if the default shell type is already correct for you. Otherwise, enter your shell type and hit enter.
    ```
    To enable autocomplete we need to append to /Users/yourusername/.zshrc the following lines:
    # Scaleway CLI autocomplete initialization.
    eval "$(scw autocomplete script shell=zsh)"
    Do you want to proceed with these changes? (Y/n):
    ```
5. Type `y` or `n` and hit enter. This should complete the configuration process:
    ```
    Initialization completed with success.
    ```


## Creating a configuration file for the Scaleway CLIv2


<Message type="important">
  Unless you add a region argument to your commands, the configuration file will be set for the default region. 
</Message>

1. Type the following command in your terminal to create a configuration file with `rclone`: 

    `scw object config get type=rclone`

    You will see the following output:

    ```
    scw object config get type=rclone
    # Generated by scaleway-cli command
    # Configuration file for rclone https://rclone.org/s3/#scaleway
    # Default location: $HOME/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
    [scaleway]
    type = s3
    env_auth = false
    endpoint = s3.fr-par.scw.cloud
    access_key_id = SCW85PRCA6HD4PDEWS5M
    secret_access_key = 8bd5d8ce-d476-4bd5-b97d-2d97e04c3c4d
    region = fr-par
    location_constraint =
    acl = private
    force_path_style = false
    server_side_encryption =
    storage_class =
    ```
2. Type the following command in your terminal to create a configuration file with `s3cmd`:

    `scw object config get type=s3cmd`

    You will see the following output:

    ```
    scw object config get type=s3cmd
    # Generated by scaleway-cli command
    # Configuration file for s3cmd https://s3tools.org/s3cmd
    # Default location: $HOME/.s3cfg
    [default]
    access_key = SCW85PRCA6HD4PDEWS5M
    bucket_location = fr-par
    host_base = s3.fr-par.scw.cloud
    host_bucket = %(bucket)s.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud
    secret_key = 12345678-1234-1234-4321-123456789123
    use_https = True
    ```
3. Type the following command in your terminal to create a configuration file with `mc`:

    `scw object config get type=mc`

    You will see the following output:

    ```
    scw object config get type=mc
    {"version":"9","hosts":{"scaleway":{"url":"https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud","accessKey":"SCW1111111111111","secretKey":"12345678-1234-1234-4321-123456789123","api":"S3v4"}}}

## Deleting an Object Storage bucket

<Message type="important">
  This will result in the deletion of every object stored inside your bucket. Your bucket name will no longer be yours and other users will be able to use it.
</Message>

1. Type the following command in your terminal to display your buckets:

    `s3cmd ls`

    You will see an output similar to the following:
