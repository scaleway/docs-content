This page explains how to configure the DELL PERC H310 / H700 / H710 / H730-P / LSI9361 RAID controller on a Scaleway Dedibox.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- A [Dedibox dedicated server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/) with a H310 / H700 / H710 / H730-P / LSI9361 RAID controller

## Checking the status of the RAID controller

To check the status of the RAID controller, run the following command:
```bash
megaclisas-status
```
This will display information about the controller, including the model, firmware version, and status of the arrays and disks.

## Checking the status of the disks

To check the health status of the disks in your RAID, run the following command:
```bash
DEVICE=/dev/sda
for i in $(megacli -pdlist -a0 | grep Id | cut -d":" -f2); do
     echo "============================== $i =============================="
    smartctl -s on -a -d megaraid,${i} ${DEVICE} -T permissive
done
```
This will display information about each disk, including its model, size, and status.

## Creating a RAID

To create a RAID, you will need to use the `megacli` command. The basic syntax is as follows:
  ```bash
  megacli -CfgLdAdd -rX [32:X] -a0
  ```
  Where:

  * `-rX` specifies the RAID level (e.g. `-r0` for RAID 0, `-r1` for RAID 1, etc.)
  * `[32:X]` specifies the slot numbers of the disks to include in the RAID
  * `-a0` specifies the adapter number (usually 0)

  For example, to create a RAID 1 on two disks, you would use the following command:
  ```bash
  megacli -CfgLdAdd -r1 [32:0,32:1] -a0
  ```

## Deleting a RAID

To delete a RAID, you will need to use the following commands:
```bash
megacli -PdList -a0
megacli -LdPdInfo -a0
megacli -AdpSetProp -EnableJBOD -0 -a0
megacli -CfgLdDel -Lall -Force -a0
megacli -CfgForeign -Clear -a0
```
This will delete the RAID and return the disks to an unconfigured state.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with your RAID, you can use the `megaclisas-status` command to check the status of the controller and disks. You can also use the `smartctl` command to check the health status of the disks.
