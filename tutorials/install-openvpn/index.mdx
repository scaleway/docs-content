[OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/community/) is an open-source software to run a [virtual Private Network (VPN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) to create secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations. The software uses a proprietary security protocol that uses SSL/TLS for key exchange.

## Installing Easy-RSA

The first step in building an OpenVPN configuration is to establish a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure). It is composed of the following elements:

  - a public and private key for the server and each client
  - the certification authority (CA) and the key used to identify servers as well as client certificate

<Message type="important">
  For security reasons, it is recommended to run the CA on a different computer from the OpenVPN server.
</Message> 

OpenVPN supports two-way certificate-based authentication, this means that the client must authenticate the server certificate and the server must authenticate the client certificate before mutual trust is established.

Both the server and the client will authenticate each other. First, the certificate needs to be signed by the certification authority (CA) then, the information in the header (common name of the certificate or the certificate type) of the authenticated certificate can be tested.

1. [Connect to your Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/) via SSH.
2. Update the APT package cache and the software already installed.
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
3. Install easy-RSA.
    ```
    apt install easy-rsa -y
    ```
4. Copy the easy-RSA directory into `/etc/openvpn`.
    ```
    mkdir -p /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/
    cp -r /usr/share/easy-rsa/* /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/
    ```
5. Modify `/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/vars` by adjusting the following values so they match your configuration.
    ```
    # These are the default values for fields
    # which will be placed in the certificate.
    # Don't leave any of these fields blank.
    export KEY_COUNTRY="US"
    export KEY_PROVINCE="CA"
    export KEY_CITY="SanFrancisco"
    export KEY_ORG="Fort-Funston"
    export KEY_EMAIL="me@myhost.mydomain"
    export KEY_OU="MyOrganizationalUnit"
    ```
6. Run the following commands to generate the Certificate Authority and a key:
    ```
    cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/
    cp openssl-1.0.0.cnf openssl.cnf
    source vars
    ./clean-all
    ./build-ca
    ```
7. Generate a certificate and a private key for the server:
    ```
    ./build-key-server openvpn-server
    ```

    Such as in the previous step, most of the default settings can be kept. Two requests require positive answers: `Sign the certificate? [y/n]` and `1 out of 1 certificate requests certified, commit? [y/n]`.
8. Generate a [Diffie Hellman key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange) for the OpenVPN server.
    ```
    ./build-dh
    ```
9. All certificates and keys have been generated in the **keys/** subdirectory. It is recommended to copy them into the directory `/etc/openvpn/`.
    ```
    cd keys/
    cp ca.crt  dh2048.pem  openvpn-server.crt  openvpn-server.key /etc/openvpn/
    ```
10. The VPN client also needs a certificate to authenticate against the server. It is recommended to create a certificate for each client by running the following commands:
    ```
    cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/
    source vars
    ./build-key openvpn-client01
    ```

When prompted, confirm the following questions: `Sign the certificate? [y/n]` and `1 out of 1 certificate requests certified, commit? [y/n]`.

Copy the following files to the client:

- /etc/openvpn/ca.crt
- /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/openvpn-client01.crt
- /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/openvpn-client01.key

<Message type="important">
  Since client certificates and keys are only required on the client machine, it is recommended to delete them from the server for security reasons.
</Message>

## Installing and configuring OpenVPN

As you have generated both the servers and the client certificate, you can now configure the OpenVPN server.

1. Start by installing the OpenVPN server:
    ```
    apt install openvpn -y
    ```
2. Create a configuration file `/etc/openvpn/openvpn-server.conf` for the server:
    ```

    # Push routes to the client to allow it

    # To assign specific IP addresses to specific
    # clients or if a connecting client has a private
    # subnet behind it that should also have VPN access,
    # use the subdirectory "ccd" for client-specific
    # configuration files (see man page for more info).

    # EXAMPLE: Suppose the client
    # having the certificate common name "Thelonious"
    # also has a small subnet behind his connecting
    # machine, such as 192.168.40.128/255.255.255.248.
    # First, uncomment out these lines:
    ;client-config-dir ccd
    ;route 192.168.40.128 255.255.255.248
    # Then create a file ccd/Thelonious with this line:
    #   iroute 192.168.40.128 255.255.255.248
    # This will allow Thelonious' private subnet to
    # access the VPN.  This example will only work
    # if you are routing, not bridging, i.e. you are
    # using "dev tun" and "server" directives.

    # EXAMPLE: Suppose you want to give
    # Thelonious a fixed VPN IP address of 10.9.0.1.
    # First uncomment out these lines:
    ;client-config-dir ccd
    ;route 10.9.0.0 255.255.255.252
    # Then add this line to ccd/Thelonious:
    #   ifconfig-push 10.9.0.1 10.9.0.2

    # Suppose that you want to enable different
    # firewall access policies for different groups
    # of clients.  There are two methods:
    # (1) Run multiple OpenVPN daemons, one for each
    #     group, and firewall the TUN/TAP interface
    #     for each group/daemon appropriately.
    # (2) (Advanced) Create a script to dynamically
    #     modify the firewall in response to access
    #     from different clients.  See man
    #     page for more info on learn-address script.

    # If enabled, this directive will configure
    # all clients to redirect their default

8. Enable the service to start it automatically when your Instance boots.
    ```
    systemctl enable openvpn@openvpn-server.service
    ```

Your OpenVPN server is now ready to accept connections.

### Configuring the client

1. To connect to your server you have to install the OpenVPN client. On **Ubuntu Linux**, you can install it easily with apt.
    ```
    apt install openvpn
    ```
    If your computer is running a **Windows** Operating system, you can download the [OpenVPN client for Windows](https://openvpn.net/client-connect-vpn-for-windows/). On **macOS** you can use a tool like [Tunnelblick](https://tunnelblick.net/downloads.html) to establish the VPN connection.

    Make sure that you have copied the following files on your local computer before continuing:
      - /etc/openvpn/ca.crt
      - /etc/openvpn/ta.key
      - /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/openvpn-client01.crt
      - /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/openvpn-client01.key

    You can download them for example via SFTP with [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/).
2. Create a configuration file `openvpn-client01.ovpn` for the client and put the following information in it.
    ```
    ##############################################

    # This configuration can be used by multiple #
    # clients, however each client should have   #
    # its own cert and key files.                #
    #                                            #

    Add your OpenVPN server's IP at `remote YOUR_SERVER_IP 1194` and make sure all file names correspond to your files.
3. Restart the openvpn client. On Ubuntu:
    ```
    systemctl restart openvpn@openvpn-client01.service
    ```

On Windows or macOS, double click the **openvpn-client01.ovpn** file to import the configuration settings into your client.

You can now connect to the Internet via your VPN.

For more configuration options, refer to the [official documentation](https://openvpn.net/vpn-server-resources/) of OpenVPN.
