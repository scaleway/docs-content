You now have access to a dedicated **Scheduled for Deletion** tab for your Key Manager keys in the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/key-manager/). This new tab provides a clear, centralized view of all your keys that are scheduled for deletion within the next seven days. This gives you a crucial window to review and take action on keys before they are permanently deleted.
