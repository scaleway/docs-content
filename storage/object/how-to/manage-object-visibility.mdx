Visibility specifies whether your object is visible to others or not.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)

<Message type="note">
  All objects are private by default, even if they are in a public bucket. A private file in a public bucket cannot be accessed publicly.
</Message>

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the name of your bucket. A list of your objects displays.
3. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the selected object name.
4. Click **Visibility**. A pop-up appears.
5. Check **Public** or **Private** according to your preference.
6. Click **Update object visibility** to confirm.

<Message type="important">
  You can only configure the visibility (public or private) of one object at a time. It is not possible to perform this action on an entire bucket, on which visibility is defined by default as private. Allowing public visibility of a bucket only allows the viewing of a list of objects that are stored in the bucket.

<Message type="tip">
If you upload a file using the CLI, you can make it public by using the `--acl public-read` parameter.
