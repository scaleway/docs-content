This page shows you how to upgrade your Public Gateway to a superior offer type, allowing you to take advantage of higher bandwidth and better performance. You can upgrade from the console in just a couple of clicks by following this procedure.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a Public Gateway](/network/public-gateways/how-to/create-a-public-gateway/) that is not already a PGW-L (the most powerful offer type availble).

1. Click **Public Gateways** in the **Network** section of the side menu.
2. Click the Public Gateway you want to upgrade. Its **Overview** dashboard displays.
3. In the **Upgrade** panel, click **Upgrade**. A pop-up displays.
4. Select the [offer type](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/network/#public-gateway) to upgrade to. 
    <Message type="note">
    You can only upgrade to superior (not inferior) offer types, and you will not be able to revert to an inferior offer type after you upgrade. Your Public Gateway may be unavailable for a few seconds during the upgrade operation.
