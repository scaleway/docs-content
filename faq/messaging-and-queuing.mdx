## What is NATS / SNS / SQS ?

NATS, SNS and SQS are all messaging protocols supported by Scaleway Messaging and Queuing. You can find out more about these protocols, and other essential Messaging and Queuing concepts, on our dedicated [concepts page](/serverless/messaging/concepts/).

## Is the Scaleway Messaging and Queuing SQS gateway compatible with my application/framework/tool?

We currently implement the API endpoints listed [here](/serverless/messaging/reference-content/sqs-support/), which makes Scaleway Messaging and Queuing compatible with the AWS SDK as well as many other tools and frameworks including KEDA and Symfony. Note that you need to specify both Regions and URL to ensure compatibility.

## Does Scaleway Messaging and Queuing support all SNS features?

The following subscriber types are supported:
- HTTP/S clients
- Serverless Functions
- SQS queues in the same [Project](/console/my-project/concepts/#project)

For more details on supported and unsupported SNS features, see our [dedicated page](/serverless/messaging/reference-content/sns-support/)

## Can I configure Messaging and Queuing via Terraform?

Yes, check out our [tutorial](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/scaleway/scaleway/latest/docs/guides/mnq_with_nats_terraform_provider) on configuring Messaging and Queuing with the Terraform [NATS Jetstream provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/nats-io/jetstream/latest/docs).

## What happened to Messaging and Queueing namespaces?

When Messaging and Queuing went into General Availability, namespaces were deprecated. 

Now, each [Scaleway Project](/console/my-project/concepts/#project) has a single space for its SQS credentials (where you can also create queues), and another for its SNS credentials. Each must be [activated](/serverless/messaging/how-to/get-started/#how-to-activate-sqs-or-sns) to start using it. 

For NATS, each Project must [create a NATS account](/serverless/messaging/how-to/#how-to-create-a-nats-account) to hold NATS credentials. You can create multiple NATS accounts per Project if you wish.

This is designed to provide a better and more secure experience, as well as preparing Messaging and Queuing for further integration into the Scaleway ecosystem.
