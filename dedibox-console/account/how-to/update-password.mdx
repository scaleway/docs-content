For security reasons it is recommended to change your passwords regularly. You can update the password of your account from the Scaleway Dedibox console.

</Message>

1. Click your username next to _logged in as:_ in the top right corner of the console. Then click **Account information** in the pop-up menu. The account information page displays.
2. Click **Update** next to your (hidden) password:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-dedibox-console-update-password.webp" alt="" />
3. Click the link sent to your registered email address, to access the email update form.
4. Enter your current password, your new password, and its confirmation. Click **Update my password** to submit the form.
