[Mastodon](https://www.joinmastodon.org/) is an open-source, self-hosted, social media and social networking service. It allows you to host your own Instances which may have their own code of conduct, terms of service and moderation policies. There is no central server and Mastodon Instances are connected as a federated social network, allowing users from different Instances to interact with each other. The platform provides privacy features allowing users to adjust the privacy settings of each of their posts.

As there is no central server, you can choose whether to join or leave an instance according to its policy without actually leaving Mastodon Social Network. Mastodon is a part of [Fediverse](https://fediverse.party/), allowing users to interact with users on other platforms that support the same protocol for example: [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/en/), [Friendica](https://friendi.ca/) and [GNU Social](https://gnu.io/social/).

Mastodon provides the possibility of using [S3 compatible Object Storage](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/) to store media content uploaded to Instances, making it flexible and scalable.

</Message>

## Installing Prework

1. [Connect to your instance](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/) via SSH.
2. Update the APT packet cache and the software already installed on the instance.
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
3. Install `curl` on the system and add an external repository for the required version of Node.js. Install it by running the following commands:
    ```
    apt install curl -y
    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | bash -
    ```
    Mastodon uses the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) package manager.
4. Install the repository for the required version of Yarn by running the following commands:
    ```
    curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | apt-key add -
    echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
    ```
5. Update the system and install Yarn.
    ```
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y yarn
    ```
6. Install the following packages, which Mastodon depends on:
    - [Imagemagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/) for image related operations
    - [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) for conversion of GIFs to MP4s
    - [Protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) with `libprotobuf-dev` and `protobuf-compiler`, used for language detection
    - [Nginx](https://nginx.org/) as frontend web server
    - [Redis](https://redis.io/) for its in-memory data structure store
    - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is used as SQL database for Mastodon
    - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is used for Mastodon's streaming API
    - [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) is a Node.js package manager
    - [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) is a tool to manage TLS certificated issued by the [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) nonprofit "Certificate Authority" (CA)
    - other `-dev` packages and `g++`. These packages are required for the compilation of Ruby using ruby-build.

  ```
  apt install -y imagemagick ffmpeg libpq-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev file git-core g++ libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler pkg-config nodejs gcc autoconf bison build-essential libssl-dev libyaml-dev libreadline6-dev zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libffi-dev libgdbm6 libgdbm-dev nginx redis-server redis-tools postgresql postgresql-contrib certbot python3-certbot-nginx yarn libidn11-dev libicu-dev libjemalloc-dev
  ```

  We are going to use `rbenv` to manage Ruby versions. The application must be installed for a single Linux user, therefore, first we must create a user under which Mastodon will run. 
7. Run the following command. The `--disabled-login` flag disables direct login to the user account for increased security.
    ```
    adduser --disabled-login mastodon
    ```
8. Log into the `mastodon` user account and change to the home directory.
    ```
    su mastodon
    cd
    ```
9. Set up [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build):
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
    cd ~/.rbenv && src/configure && make -C src
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
    # Restart the users shell
    exec bash
    # Check if rbenv is correctly installed
    type rbenv
    # Install ruby-build as a rbenv plugin
    git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
    ```
10. Install and enable the version of [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) that is used by Mastodon. 
    ```
    RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS=--with-jemalloc rbenv install 2.6.6
    rbenv global 2.6.6
    ```
    <Message type="not">
      This step may take up to several minutes to complete.
    </Message>
11. Run the following command to install `bundler`:
    ```
    gem install bundler --no-document
    ```
12. Switch back into the root account by typing `exit`.
## Configuring PostgreSQL

Mastodon requires access to a postgreSQL database to store its configuration and user data.

1. Change into the `postgres` user account, run `psql` and create a database:
    ```
    sudo -u postgres psql
    ```
2. Create the database user for Mastodon and exit:
    ```
    CREATE USER mastodon CREATEDB;
    \q
    ```

## Downloading Mastodon

1. Switch into the `mastodon` user account:
    ```
    su - mastodon
    ```
2. Enter the user's home directory and clone the Mastodon Git repository into the `live` directory:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon.git live && cd live
    ```
3. Check out to the latest stable branch.
    ```
    git checkout $(git tag -l | grep -v 'rc[0-9]*$' | sort -V | tail -n 1)
    ```
4. Install the remaining Ruby dependencies:
    ```
    bundle config deployment 'true'
    bundle config without 'development test'
    bundle install -j$(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN)
    ```
5.  Use yarn to install the node.js dependencies:
    ```
    yarn install --pure-lockfile
    ```
6. Type and enter `exit` to return to the root account.

## Requesting a Let's Encrypt Certificate

1. Stop Nginx before requesting the certificate:
    ```
    systemctl stop nginx.service
    ```

2. Use `certbot` to request a certficate with TLS SNI validation in standalone mode. Replace `example.com` with your domain name:
    ```
    certbot certonly --standalone -d example.com
    ```

    As Let's Encrypt certficates have a validity of 90 days, a cron-job can be used to renew them and to restart nginx automatically. 
3. Create a new file and open it in a text editor like nano:
    ```
    nano /etc/cron.daily/letsencrypt-renew
    ```
4. Copy the following content into the file, save it and exit nano:
    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    certbot renew
    systemctl reload nginx.service
    ```
5. Allow execution of the script and restart the cron daemon. It will run the script daily:
    ```
    chmod +x /etc/cron.daily/letsencrypt-renew
    systemctl restart cron.service
    ```

## Configuring Nginx

1. Copy the example configuration file shipped with Mastodon in your Nginx `sites-available` directory and create a symlink to it in the `sites-enabled` directory:
    ```
    cp /home/mastodon/live/dist/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/mastodon
    ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/mastodon /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/mastodon
    ```
2. Open the configuration file in a text editor, such as nano:
    ```
    nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/mastodon
    ```
3. Replace `example.com` in the configuration file with your domain or subdomain. Replace with your domain in all following occurrences as well.
    ```
    map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
      default upgrade;
      ''      close;
    }

    upstream backend {
        server 127.0.0.1:3000 fail_timeout=0;

    ```
4. Save and exit.

## Configuring the Mastodon Application

1. Enter the `mastodon` user account:
    ```
    su - mastodon
    ```
2. Change into the **/home/mastodon/live** directory and run the Mastodon installer:
    ```
    cd /home/mastodon/live
    RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake mastodon:setup
    ```

    The interactive installer guides you through the setup process.
3. Enter the domain name or subdomain of the instance.
4. Select **No** when asked if you want to use Docker. 

    Most of the other values are already pre-filled with the correct settings. Edit them if required for your setup.
5. Select **Amazon S3** as a service provider to set up Mastodon with Object Storage. Valid [API keys](/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key/) are required in this step.

    Enter the details as following:

    ```
    Provider Amazon S3
    S3 bucket name: [scaleway_bucket_name]
    S3 region: fr-par
    S3 hostname: s3.fr-par.scw.cloud
    S3 access key: [scaleway_access_key]
    S3 secret key: [scaleway_secret_key]
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      If your bucket is located in Amsterdam, use `nl-ams` as region and `s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud` as S3 hostname If it is located in Warsaw, use `pl-waw` and `s3.pl-waw.scw.cloud`.
    </Message>

    Once the configuration is complete, the installer will start to compile the application. This may take some time and consume a lot of RAM.

    Once the application is installed, you will be asked if you want to create an Administrator account for your Mastodon instance.
3. Type `Y` to create the account. Enter the username for the admin user, followed by your email address. A random password will be generated. Take a note of it, as you will need it to connect to your Instance.
    ```
    All done! You can now power on the Mastodon server 🐘

    Do you want to create an admin user straight away? Yes
    Username: admin  <-- Enter the username for your Mastodon admin account
    E-mail: me@myemail.com <-- Enter your email address
    You can login with the password: 9dc4d92d93a26e9b6c021bb75b4a3ce2
    ```
4. Type `exit` to switch back into the root account.

## Setting-up systemd Services

Systemd scripts are used to manage services on Ubuntu systems. Three different scripts are required for Mastodon. These scripts come with the Mastodon package, you need to copy them to their final destination, then activate the services.

1. Copy the Mastodon `systemd` scripts into their final destination:
    ```
    cp /home/mastodon/live/dist/mastodon-*.service /etc/systemd/system/
    ```
2. Reload the systemd daemon:
    ```
    systemctl daemon-reload
    ```
3. Start the services and enable them, so they will start automatically upon the next system reboot:
    ```
    systemctl start mastodon-web.service mastodon-sidekiq.service mastodon-streaming.service
    systemctl enable mastodon-web.service mastodon-sidekiq.service mastodon-streaming.service
    ```
4. Verify if all services are running:
    ```
    systemctl status mastodon-*.service
    ```

If everything is running, open a web browser and go to your domain name. You will see the home page of your Mastodon instance:

<Lightbox src="scaleway-mastodon_home_new.webp" alt="" />

You can log in with the admin account that you have created during the installation to configure additional parameters of your instance, link the instance with another one to join a federated network, create another user account and start sharing posts and photos on your timeline. If configured with Object Storage, all files uploaded to the instance are automatically stored in the Object Storage bucket and embedded in the users timeline:

<Lightbox src="scaleway-mastodon_feed.webp" alt="" />

For more information and advanced configuration of Mastodon, refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/tootsuite/documentation#running-mastodon).
