As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance infrastructure capabilities and provide better services to our customers, Scaleway is [introducing routed IPs for all products](https://www.scaleway.com/en/news/routed-ips-are-coming-to-all-scaleway-products/), including Kubernetes (K8s) worker nodes.

One of the standout benefits of routed IPs is their support for [IP mobility](/compute/instances/concepts/#ip-mobility), streamlining IP management and movement within the Scaleway ecosystem. By simplifying the process of reallocating IPs across different products, routed IPs empower users with unprecedented flexibility and control over their network infrastructure.

Additionally, routed IPs unlock the ability to attach multiple IPv4 addresses to a single Instance, enabling specific functionalities such as IP failover. While this feature may have limited applicability within Kubernetes environments, it offers invaluable flexibility and resilience across other Scaleway products.

<Message type="note">
  Routed IPs provide primary support for IPv6, ensuring direct connectivity for IPv6 addresses with Instances.
  However, IPv6 support for Kapsule is not yet available due to compatibility limitations with existing Container Network Interfaces (CNIs).

<Message type="important">
    NAT IPs will reach end-of-life on October 1st, 2024. After this date, Scaleway will organize migrations for all clusters to transition to routed IPs.
    Migrations are planned region by region:
    * For clusters in Warsaw (`pl-waw-1`), the migration is scheduled for October 1st to October 7th, 2024. [Learn more](https://status.scaleway.com/incidents/l45384bsm5w0).
    * For clusters in Amsterdam (`nl-ams-1`, `nl-ams-2`, and `nl-ams-3`), the migration is scheduled for October 7 to October 14, 2024. [Learn more](https://status.scaleway.com/incidents/bctz2b9fhpqc).
    * For clusters in Paris (`fr-par-1`, `fr-par-2`, and `fr-ar-3`), the migration is scheduled for October 14 to October 21, 2024. [Learn more](https://status.scaleway.com/incidents/1gh354wb3j27).

## Moving your Kubernetes nodes to routed IPs

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Set up a [Kubernetes Kapsule cluster](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/)

<Message type="note">
  Kapsule and Kosmos clusters created after April 11th 2024 are deployed with IP mobility enabled by default. For existing clusters, you can manually launch the migration to routed IPs.
</Message>

### Using the Scaleway console

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The Kubernetes overview displays.
2. Click the name of the cluster you want to access. The cluster overview page displays.
3. Click the **Network** tab. The cluster network information displays.
4. Click **Move to routed IP** in the **IP address type** section of the page. A pop-up displays.
5. Confirm the move of your worker nodes to routed IPs by typing **MOVE**, then click **Move to routed IPs** to launch the process.
    <Message type="important">
      * This operation is similar to a cluster upgrade. Each node in your cluster will reboot. Ensure that you have more than one node ready in order to avoid downtime.
      * Kubernetes clusters use dynamic IPs, meaning nodes may receive new public IPs upon reboot. Users relying on node IPs for filtering/whitelisting should take necessary precautions.
    </Message>

    The worker nodes of your Kubernetes cluster will reboot during the process and a new flexible IP will be assigned to each worker node.
    Once the migration has completed, the IP address type of your cluster will change to **Routed flexible IPs**.

### Using the API

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created a [Kubernetes cluster](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/) that uses NAT IPs
- A valid [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)

1. Configure the following variables for your Kubernetes cluster:
    ```
    REGION=fr-par # The region of your cluster. Can be either "fr-par", "nl-ams", or "pl-waw"
    CLUSTER_ID=b69106db-e212-4fff-9584-5da4a47217ed # The ID of your Kubernetes cluster
    SCW_SECRET_KEY=196dadd9-5685-42c8-aa71-a34d46861303 # Your Scaleway secret key
    ```
2. Run the following command to launch the migration of existing Kubernetes clusters to routed IPs:
    ```
    curl --location "https://api.scaleway.com/k8s/v1/regions/$REGION/clusters/$CLUSTER_ID/migrate-to-routed-ips" --header "x-auth-token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{}'
    ```
    <Message type="important">
      * Activating routed IPs on Kubernetes nodes will require draining each node before reconfiguration and reboot. Single-node clusters will experience downtime during this process.
        It is recommended to have **at least two nodes** and proper configuration to minimize downtime.
      * Kubernetes clusters use dynamic IPs, meaning nodes may receive new public IPs upon reboot. Users relying on node IPs for filtering/whitelisting should take necessary precautions.
