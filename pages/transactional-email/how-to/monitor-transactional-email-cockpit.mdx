## How to activate your Cockpit

Scaleway Cockpit is activated by default if you have created any [Scaleway resources integrated with Cockpit](/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-limitations/#product-integration-into-cockpit).

## How to access the Grafana dashboard

To view your TEM metrics, use the Grafana preconfigured dashboard which is accessible from the Scaleway console:
  - First, you must create a user and their associated credentials (a username and password) for Grafana
  - Then, you can use these credentials to access Grafana from the Scaleway console, and visualize preconfigured dashboards for all your Scaleway products.

1. Create a Grafana user and retrieve their username and password by [following this procedure](/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/).

2. From the Scaleway console [Cockpit overview page](https://console.scaleway.com/cockpit/overview), click **Open dashboards** in the top right corner.

3. Enter your Grafana username and password to log in.

    You are directed to the Scaleway Cockpit dashboards homepage.

## How to view and understand your TEM metrics

1. Click **Open dashboards** on the top right from the Scaleway Cockpit dashboards homepage.
2. Click either **TEM Overview** or **TEM Overview**, depending on your engine of choice, on the left side menu.
