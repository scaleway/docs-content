[Snapshots](/storage/database/how-to/manage-snapshots/) is a feature with which you can back up an entire Instance, instead of creating individual automated database backups. It is only available for Database Instances that use Block Storage volumes. 

When you set up [autobackups](/storage/database/how-to/enable-autobackup/) for Instances that use Block Storage, the automatic backups are created in Snapshot format. 

You can have up to 100 snapshots per Instance and project (depending on quotas).

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-snapshot.webp" alt="" />
3. Enter a name for your snapshot and set up the expiration date and time.
  <Message type="note">

  The default retention period for snapshots is 365 days. 

  </Message>

4. Click **Create snapshot** to confirm. 

## How to delete snapshots

When you delete an Instance, its associated snapshots are not deleted. Snapshots can be manually deleted or will be deleted after the retention period defined.

If you do not wish to wait for the snapshot to expire, you can delete it manually. 

1. Go to the **Snapshots** tab of your Database Instance of choice.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the name of the snapshot. 
3. Click **Delete**.
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-delete-snapshot.webp" alt="" />

  A pop up displays to warn you that:

  <Message type="important">

  This will permanently destroy your snapshot and all your data will be lost. This action is irreversible.

  </Message>

4. Click **Delete this snapshot** if you wish to continue.
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-delete-snapshot-pop-up.webp" alt="" />

## How to restore snapshots

When you restore a snapshot, a new Instance is created and billed to your account.

1. Go to the **Snapshots** tab of your Database Instance of choice.
2. Click the <Icon name="more" /> next to the name of the snapshot.  
3. Click **Create Instance from snapshot**. A pop up appears.
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-instance-pop-up.webp" alt="" />
4. Follow the steps: 
    - Enter a name for your new Instance (1)
    - Select a node type (2) 
    - Choose a configuration (3)

  <Message type="important">

  It is possible to select a larger node type for your new Instance. However, the block volume size will be the same as the size of the restored snapshot. All Instance settings will be restored if you chose a node type with the same or more memory size than the initial Instance. Settings will be reset to the default if your node type has less memory.

  </Message>
5. Click **Create Instance** to confirm. 

You can see the new Instance in your Database Instances list.
