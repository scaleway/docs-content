Developed by **Quandela**, a French quantum computing leader founded in 2017. Their technology is based on Linear Optical Quantum Computing (LOQC), utilizing proprietary single-photon sources and reconfigurable optical circuits to process information at room temperature.

## Key features
* **Room temperature operation:** Unlike many quantum technologies that require cryogenic temperatures, Quandela's photonic QPUs operate at room temperature, simplifying infrastructure needs.
* **All-to-All connectivity:** The photonic qumodes are interconnected through linear optical components, allowing for flexible circuit designs and
* **Linear optical computing:** Utilizes single photons to process information through reconfigurable optical circuits, operating largely at room temperature (chip-level).
* **High-Quality Sources:** Powered by proprietary high-performance single-photon sources, ensuring indistinguishable photons for high-quality interference.
* **Native probabilistic computing:** The hardware natively implements sampling tasks, making it inherently suited for probabilistic modeling.

## Use cases
* **Quantum Machine Learning (QML):** Ideal for generative modeling, classification, and training quantum neural networks (QNNs).
* **Linear algebra:** Efficiently solves differential equations and complex linear algebra problems used in engineering and physics.
* **Certified randomness:** Generation of high-quality entropy for cryptography and stochastic simulations.

## Perceval: The native SDK for photonic

**Perceval** is the open-source software framework created by Quandela for linear optical quantum computing. It provides a simple and powerful object-oriented API to:

- **Design** - linear optical circuits (Beam Splitters, Phase Shifters, etc.).
- **Simulate** - photon behavior (ideal or noisy simulation).
- **Execute** - algorithms on various backends: local simulators, high-performance remote simulators (on GPU), or real photonic QPUs.

On Scaleway QaaS, the integration is natively integrated into `perceval-quandela` package, which acts as a remote backend for your sequences.
