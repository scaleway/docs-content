When you are added to a Scaleway Organization, you become a member of said Organization. To access the Organization, you must perform a first login and comply with your Organization's security requirements.

## How to log in

<Macro id="login-member" />

## How to comply with security requirements

Upon your first login as a member, you must comply to your Organization's security requirements to ensure you can log in without issues in the future.

When you log in for the first time, a security checklist displays in your Scaleway console.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-iam-member-sec-req.webp" alt="screenshot of the scaleway console showing a checklist of the few quick steps to follow until you can explore the Scaleway console. 1. Update password - You are required to update your password to stay connected to this Organization. A message box indicated that there is 1 day left to update the password. It warns that once this grace period is up, you will be locked out of the Organization until an administrator unlocks your account. A button prompts to update the password. "/>

Currently, the mandatory security requirements include:

- Updating your password
- Setting up MFA

### Grace period

New IAM members have a grace period available to comply with security requirements. The grace period is defined by the Organization's administrator or is set to default (7 days).

<Message type="important">
Once the grace period is over, your member account is automatically locked and you must personally contact the Organization administrator to unlock you. When you regain access to the Organization, the grace period resets and you have the set amount of time to comply with the requirements again.
</Message>

For example, if your Organization's grace period is set to default, you have 7 days, starting from your first login, to renew your password or define a new one, and to set up MFA. If you fail to comply until the 11:59 p.m. of the 7th day, you will get locked out of the Organization at 00:00 a.m. of the 8th day.

### How to update a password

Passwords are not required for a first member login.

However, even if your Organization administrator provides you with a password or you log in using a code, you must update your password after your first login.

1. Click **Update password** in your security requirements **Checklist** in the Scaleway console. A pop-up appears.
    <Message type="note">
    The security requirements checklist is only visible to new members who have not complied with their Organization's security requirements.
    </Message>
2. Define a new password in the box.
3. (Optional) Check the box if you want to send the password to your email.
    <Message type="tip">
    Make sure you copy and securely store the password, as it will only be shown once. If you lose access to your password, you must renew it.
    </Message>

If all security requirements are met, you will be redirected to the Organization dashboard. If not, follow the steps of the [next section](#how-to-set-up-mfa-as-a-member) to complete the checklist.

## How to generate an API key

Once you have performed your first login as a member, we recommend you create an API key for yourself.

Follow the [How to create an API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys) documentation page to do so.
