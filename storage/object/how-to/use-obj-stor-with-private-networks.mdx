The [Public Gateway](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#public-gateway) feature of the [Private Network](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#private-networks) allows Instances in your Private Network to reach resources on the Internet without using a public IP address.

In this documentation, you will learn how to create an Instance without a public IP address, create a Private Network with a Public Gateway, and a route from your Instance to an Object Storage bucket.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created an Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)
</Message>

## How to create an Instance without a public IP

Follow the instructions for [creating an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance). We create an Instance without a flexible IP, using the following specifications for our Instance:
  - **Availability Zone**:`fr-par-2` (but you can select the AZ of your choice).
  - **OS Image:**: Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa
  - **Instance type:**: DEV1-S
  - **Advanced options:** Untick the flexible IP option

<Message type="tip">
  You could also use one of the following methods to create your Instance:
  - Use [this link](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers/create?area=fr-par&imageGroup=distribution_ubuntu&imageKey=3f1b9623-71ba-4fe3-b994-27fcdaa850ba&region=fr-par-2&selectedImageTab=distribution&selectedServerGroup=Development&serverKey=fr-par-2DEV1-S) to have your Instance automatically configured in the console with the required parameters. Just click **Create an Instance** to launch the instance creation process.
  - If you have installed the Scaleway CLI tool, create the Instance using the following command:
      ```
      scw instance server create type=DEV1-S zone=fr-par-1 image=ubuntu_bionic root-volume=l:20G name=objectstorage-over-pn ip=none
      ```

## How to create a Private Network and attach the Instance

1. Follow the instructions for [creating a Private Network](/network/public-gateways/how-to/use-private-networks/#how-to-create-a-private-network). Make sure to select the same availability zone as for your previously created Instance. After creating your Private Network, you are directed to a list of this and any other Private Networks you have previously created.
2. Click on the name of your new Private Network. The network's dashboard displays.
3. Click on the **Instances tab**.
4. Add the Instance you created previously to the Private Network by typing its name in the search bar. Validate by clicking **Add instance**.

## How to create a Public Gateway and attach the Private Network

1. Follow the instructions for [creating a Public Gateway](/network/public-gateways/how-to/create-a-public-gateway/):
    - Make sure to select the same availability zone as for your previously created Instance and Private Network.
    - Leave the IP configuration empty to allocate a new IP to your Public Gateway.
    - You can choose a gateway type, name and tags according to your own choice.
    After creating your Public Gateway, you are directed to a list of this and any other Public Gateways you have previously created.
2. Click on your new Public Gateway's name. The gateway's dashboard displays.
3. Click the **Private Networks** tab
4. Click **Create and attach a new Private Network**. A pop-up window displays.
5. Select **Select and attach an existing Private Network** and choose your Private Network from the drop down list. Enable the DHCP server and set **Dynamic NAT** to active. Enter an IP-range for your Private Network - in this how-to we use `192.168.42.0/24` but you are free to use any private IP range. 
6. Click **Attach a Private Network**.

## How to set the Object Storage Route

1. SSH into your machine using the following command:
    ```
    ssh root@your_virtual_instance_ip
    ```

    <Message type="note">
    As your Instance has no public IP address, you have to connect to it using another Instance in your Private Network or assign a temporary public IP to it. 

    </Message>
2. Configure the following route to the Object Storage platform:
    ```sh
    # set this to keep the network on the instance
    $> ip route add 10.0.0.0/8 via `ip route | grep default | awk '{print $3} '` dev ens2
    # dhcp on pn interface
    $> dhclient ens5
    # change default route
    $> ip route del default via `ip route | grep default | awk '{print $3} '` dev ens2
    $> ip route add default via 192.168.42.1 dev ens5 # use the gateway ip in the gateway's description
    $> curl https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud
    ```

## Conclusion

You have now configured an Instance with a Private Network to communicate with Scaleway's Object Storage platform using the Public Gateway feature. The gateway ensures the exchange of data between your Private Network and the public Internet.
