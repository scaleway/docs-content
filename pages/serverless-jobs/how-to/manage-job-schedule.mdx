Job scheduling allows you to execute a Serverless Job on a recurring schedule, based on a [cron expression](/serverless-jobs/reference-content/cron-schedules/), in the `* * * * *` format, using the desired time zone.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a Serverless Job](/serverless-jobs/how-to/create-job/)

1. Click **Jobs** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The jobs page displays.

2. Click the name of the job you want to manage, then click the **Settings** tab.

3. Scroll down to the **Job scheduling** section, and edit the cron expression and the time zone.
