Scaleway Dedibox provides an anti-DDoS service by default on all its servers.

The Scaleway Dedibox DDoS protection technology is based on detection and mitigation algorithms powered by Arbor® Networks Peakflow and Sevi® M6-NG devices. Dedibox immediately detects threats and filters them with minimal impact on services.

The equipment, placed at the heart of our network, allows the automatic detection of DDoS attacks and the suppression of malicious traffic.

  If your activities require a higher level of management on the threat management system, two upgrade plans are available: Advanced and Curative. For more information, see the [anti-DDoS offers page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/ddos-protection/).
