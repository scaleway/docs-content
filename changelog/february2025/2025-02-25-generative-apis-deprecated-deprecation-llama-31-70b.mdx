Llama 3.1 70B is now deprecated, as the newer Llama 3.3 70B is available with similar or above performance in most use cases.
Llama 3.1 70B will remain available through API until May 25th 2025, and redirected automatically to Llama 3.3 70B afterwards. Llama 3.1 8B is not affected by this change and remains in Active support.
