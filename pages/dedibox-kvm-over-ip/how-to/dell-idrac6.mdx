This page shows you how to use [KVM](/dedibox-kvm-over-ip/concepts/#kvm-over-ip) on a Dedibox with DELL iDRAC 6.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- Installed [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation) on your machine
- Installed [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html) on your local computer
- A Dedibox server with a Dell iDRAC 6 IPMI interface

## Creating an iDRAC 6 session

1. Click **Server** > **Server List** in your Dedibox console. The list of your dedicated servers displays.
2. Click the name of the server you want to access. The server's status page displays.
3. Click **iDRAC** in the menu on the right. A pop-up displays.

4. Accept the terms for iDRAC access by clicking **I Accept**.
5. Enter the authorized IPv4 address for the iDRAC connection. The IP address of your internet connection is already pre-filled in the form. Then click **Create** to generate your credentials.
    <Message type="note">
      Currently, only IPv4 addresses are accepted.
    </Message>

The connection URL and your credentials display. Click on the link to access the iDRAC interface.


## Accessing the KVM-over-IP device using Docker

You can use Docker to access the KVM-over-IP device of your Dedibox.

Here are the rewritten steps for use with Docker Desktop:

### Installation
- On **macOS** and **Windows**, Docker Desktop is available for download from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- On **Ubuntu**, you can install Docker Desktop using the [official Docker installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

### Pull the repository
Pull the [iDRAC 6 dockerized](https://hub.docker.com/r/domistyle/idrac6/) Docker repository:
```bash
docker pull domistyle/idrac6
```
<Message type="important">
  The Docker repository `domistyle/idrac6` is not maintained or supported by Scaleway. Use of this repository is at your own risk, and Scaleway does not guarantee its functionality or security.
</Message>

### Run the container
1. Run the container with the following command:
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 5800:5800 -p 5900:5900 -e IDRAC_HOST=$ip -e IDRAC_USER=$user -e IDRAC_PASSWORD=$password domistyle/idrac6
    ```
    <Message type="note">
      - Replace `$ip`, `$user` and `$password` with your iDRAC credentials.
    </Message>
2. Access the HTML5 KVM by opening `http://localhost:5800` in a web browser.

## Alternative: Accessing the KVM-over-IP device using Java

If you do not want to use Docker to access the KVM-over-IP device of your server, you can use a Java applet to launch the virtual console.

1. Open the connection URL of your iDRAC in your web browser, then log in using the credentials displayed during access creation.
2. Click **Console/Media** the top menu.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_idrac_console.webp" alt="" />
3. Click **Launch Virtual Console**.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_idrac_launch_console.webp"  alt="" />
4. Download and execute the Java web start file. The virtual console window displays.

    <Message type="important">
      **Security warning:** To execute the Java applet, you may need to set your Java security settings to **Low**. This may pose a security risk to your system. Please exercise caution and consider using Docker instead.

## Installing an operating system using the virtual console

You can use the virtual console to install an operating system on your server.
1. Connect to the virtual console as described in the previous section.
2. Download the ISO file of the operating system you want to install.
5. Click **Virtual Media** > **Launch virtual media** in the virtual console window. A pop-up window displays.
6. Click **Add Image...**  and select the ISO file containing your operating system. Keep the window open.
7. Go back to the virtual console window and click **Power** > **Reboot** to restart the machine.
8. During the boot process, press **F11** to access the BIOS boot manager.

9. Select **Virtual CD** to boot the server using the ISO file mounted in the virtual CD drive.

      The boot process may take a while, depending on your internet connection's available upstream bandwidth.
