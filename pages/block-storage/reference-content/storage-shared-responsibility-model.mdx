*   **Applications and Databases:** Maintaining the applications and databases themselves.

Furthermore, Scaleway procures the necessary licenses and usage rights for any third-party solutions that are either used by Scaleway in delivering the Service or made available to the client as part of the Service. It provides the client with necessary information regarding the characteristics and conditions of use of the Service. It also plans and implements updates to the various Service components also considering third-party products used within the Service.

You are responsible to ensure that users comply with the Service's terms of use.

Scaleway is responsible for monitoring, managing, and forecasting the Services APIs and physical clusters capacity.

You are responsible for informing Scaleway ahead of time for significant changes in your storage capacity forecast.

## Logs and Monitoring

Scaleway is responsible for the proper monitoring of the Service, including:

*   Retaining access logs and event traces related to the use and administration of the Services, such as objects and storage spaces (volumes, buckets) creation and deletion, server configuration (including physical and software resource configuration), and user and access rights additions and deletions.

*   Making access logs and event traces available to the client upon request.

### Your Responsibilities

*   Retain access logs and event traces provided by the Service Provider.

*   Ensure the successful completion of tasks performed while using the Service (e.g., volume creation for Block Storage, implementing integrity checksums for Object Storage).

*   Monitoring the available and remaining space within your provisionned volumes.

## Product Resiliency

### Availability and Steadiness

Scaleway ensures high availability through resilient infrastructure, technical and organizational measures, including monitoring service health and incident detection for the data hosted within the Service. Scaleway provides and maintains the operational condition of the control plane and APIs.

Scaleway is responsible for:

*   Implementing resiliency for the Services at least within an Availability Zone (AZ), and for multi-AZ storage tiers only across multiple Availability Zones.

*   Monitoring service health, performance, and balancing the load of use of the Service.

You are responsible for:

*   Implementing technical and organizational measures to ensure the continuity of your activities, taking into account the conditions of use and characteristics of the Service, including the nature and criticality of data stored.

*   Configuring the Service in accordance with your needs, particularly in terms of availability.

*   Monitoring and notifying breaches of Service Level Agreement concerning the availability of the service.

#### Performance

You are responsible for optimizing your applications' use of Storage Services. Scaleway monitors and optimize infrastructure-level performance, but note that:

*   Glacier cold storage data access requires object restoration and can incur delays,

*   For Object Storage Service, multipart uploads and concurrent requests should be used for large files.

**Data Integrity**

For all Storage Services, you are responsible for:

*   Verifying the successful completion of read and write operations.

*   Verifying the successful completion and integrity of backups.

For the Object Storage Service, Scaleway provides a checksum of each uploaded object allowing the client to perform integrity control or control the integrity of the checksum provided to the client at the time of upload, if applicable.

You are responsible for:

*   Verifying the successful completion of the upload via a checksum control.

*   Controlling the availability and integrity of objects, and restoring damaged objects.   

## Backups and Replication

*   Provide a data deletion certificate upon request.

## HDS specifics (Hébergement de Données de Santé)

This section outlines the specific requirements and responsibilities for hosting healthcare data in compliance with the HDS regulatory framework.

### HDS Compliance Requirements

When storing healthcare data within Scaleway Storage Services, the client is responsible for:

*   Signing Scaleway's HDS contract.

*   Ensuring access is restricted to authorized personnel.

*   Creating new volumes, snapshots, or buckets specifically for uploading HDS-compliant data.

*   Following Scaleway’s documentation on ensuring HDS compliance.

*   Using authorized storage classes only and not using the object lifecycle rules feature.

Scaleway undertakes to provide HDS-certified infrastructure, and commits to maintain this certification. The loss of said certification may result in the termination of Scaleway’s commercial relationship with the HDS client. The aforementioned elements are included in the HDS contract signed by the client.

### Data Residency

Scaleway guarantees that data remains within the authorized datacenters in Paris and does not access personal health data hosted by the client.

You must:

*   Create storage spaces (volumes, buckets, snapshots) containing healthcare data in France only. 

*   Configure replication within the authorized geographical perimeter (France) only.

*   Ensure backups residency remains within the authorized geographical perimeter (France only)

You must not configure replication, snapshots, backups or transfer data to regions outside the authorized perimeter.

### HDS-compliant Resources Identification

You are responsible for:

*   Knowing which Storage resources are HDS or not.

*   Attaching volumes to HDS-compliant Instances only.

### Block Storage Encryption and Data deletion

Encryption at rest is mandatory for Volumes hosting healthcare data. Deleted data cannot be restored.  

When using Block Storage, you are required to: 

*   Encrypt volumes 

*   Ensure secure key deletion after deleting data within your volumes to meet compliance requirements.

Scaleway is responsible for:

*   Encrypting at rest the physical disks on which volumes are stored with state-of-the-art compliant encryption keys.

*   Managing the lifecycle, rotation and deletion of the disk encryption keys to access the underlying instances.

### Object Storage Encryption and Data deletion

Encryption at rest is mandatory for Object Storage buckets hosting healthcare data, with HDS-compliant key handling by Scaleway. Scaleway provides HDS-compatible mechanisms to encrypt data at rest and guarantee HDS-compliant data deletion.

When using the Object Storage service, you are required to:

*   Follow the guidelines detailed in the documentation in order to enforce the additional encryption mechanisms required for HDS compliance.

*   Ensuring client-side data encryption or relying on existing encryption methods provided by Scaleway Object Storage.

*   Enforcing additional encryption mechanisms to guarantee HDS-compliant data deletion as described in documentation.

#### Data deletion

*   Deletion of data stored in HDS-compliant buckets is irreversible: keys are destroyed using compliant crypto-shredding methods,

*   Deleted data cannot be restored,

*   The client must ensure backups before deletion. If SSE-C is used, the client must ensure secure key deletion to meet compliance requirements.

Scaleway must maintain technical guarantees for secure deletion of healthcare data. 

### HDS-compliant Storage Classes and Prohibited Features

For the Object Storage service:

*   You must use authorized HDS-certified storage classes only (Standard, One Zone). Glacier class is not HDS-compliant and must not be used by the client to store healthcare data.

*   You must not use the lifecycle rules feature that is not permitted for HDS-compliant buckets hosting healthcare data.

For the Block Storage service:

*   You must not use legacy Block volumes and snapshots to host your HDS-compliant healthcare data.

*   If exporting/importing snapshots to and from Scaleway Object Storage, you must ensure to follow the above guidelines for end-to-end compliance across the Services.
