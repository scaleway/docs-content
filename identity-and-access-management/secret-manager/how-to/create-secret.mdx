The [secret](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#secret/) creation process slightly differs depending on whether you are using Secret Manager for the first time or not. This page explains how to create a [secret](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#secret/) for the first time using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) and how to create a secret if you have already created resources in Secret Manager.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner/) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission/) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

    5. Create a [path](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#path/) in which to store your secret. The path name **must be prefixed** with a slash.
    6. Enter a name for your secret and add optional tags.
    7. Optionally, click <Icon name="toggle" /> to enable [secret protection](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#secret-protection/).
