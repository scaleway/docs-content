## Content-based

Content-based messaging systems are a subset of the [publish/subscribe](#publishsubscribe) model, and contrast with [topic-based](#topic-based) systems in terms of the way messages are [filtered](#filtering)/routed. In a content-based messaging system, the subscriber specifies the properties of the messages they want to receive, based on the message's attributes or content. Message delivery is therefore selective, and messages are only delivered to a subscriber if the attributes or content match the constraints they set.

## Content-based deduplication

Content-based deduplication is a setting available for [FIFO](#fifo) queues and topics. Enable content-based deduplication if the message body is guaranteed to be unique for each message. A unique hash value is generated from the body of each message, which is used as its deduplication ID. This avoids the need to set a deduplication ID when sending messages. Read more in our dedicated documentation on [creating queues](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-queues/).

## Credentials

Credentials give services and platforms access to Scaleway Messaging and Queuing, enabling them to connect to the host system. Credentials are [protocol](#messaging-protocol)-specific: for SQS and SNS, different levels of permissions can be defined to write, read, or manage queues/topics, whereas NATS credentials give full read-write-manage access. Refer to our [Messaging and Queuing additional content](/serverless/messaging/reference-content/) for more information.

## Dead Letter Queue

A **D**ead **L**etter **Q**ueue (DLQ), or **undelivered-message queue**, receives and holds messages that cannot be delivered to their destination queues. You may define an existing queue as a Dead Letter Queue.

## Fanout

Fanout is a type of messaging pattern. A fanout exchange broadcasts messages to all queues/consumers it is aware of. This allows the same published message to be consumed by different consumers, who will process it in different ways. Each message is processed in the order in which it arrives.

## FIFO

FIFO stands for **F**irst **I**n **F**irst **O**ut, and represents a type of queue or topic where the exact order of messages is preserved, and duplicate messages are not tolerated. As well as these specificities, FIFO queues and topics support all the same features as the [Standard](#standard) type. Consider using FIFO queues and topics for any use cases where the order of messages is critical, such as e-commerce order management systems, systems where one action should not happen until another has been completed, or first-come-first-served ticketing systems.

## Filtering

In a [topic-based](#topic-based) system, where topics handle the logic, filtering is similar to routing. Messages are sent to defined topics, which can be thought of as filters in so far as subscribers can subscribe only to the topics they are interested in. In a [content-based](#content-based) system, filtering is carried out more directly by subscribers, who define filters for messages based on the content/attributes they want to receive.

## Long Polling

Long polling is a technology where the client requests information from the server without expecting an immediate response. In [SQS](#sqs), this enables clients to wait for the system to get messages that are not immediately available.

## Message broker

A message broker is a piece of software that allows applications, systems and services to communicate with each other and send/receive data. It facilitates the exchange of information by receiving messages from a producer, and transmitting them to a consumer. All communication with producers and consumers uses a [protocol](#messaging-protocol). There are two basic models of communication for message brokers: [publish/subscribe](#publishsubscribe) and [queuing](#queuing).

## Message retention period

The message retention period is a setting that can be configured for an SQS queue. It represents the length of time (in seconds) that messages are kept in the queue before being deleted. Setting a longer message retention period allows for a longer interval between a message being sent and it being received. Read more in our dedicated documentation on [creating queues](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-queues/).

## Messaging and Queuing

Scaleway's Messaging and Queuing product is a [message broker](#message-broker) tool that allows you to transfer messages between different microservices and platforms. This enables them to "talk" to each other effectively even if they are not otherwise compatible. Messaging and Queuing enables and simplifies microservices application development and allows you to build highly scalable, reliable, distributed applications.

## Messaging protocol

A messaging protocol defines a structured way for users / platforms / services / applications to exchange data and messages, even if normally they do not "speak the same language". Protocols also describe how messages should be processed, prioritized, managed and routed. Messaging protocols currently supported by Scaleway Messaging and Queuing include [NATS](#nats), [SQS](#sqs) and [SNS](#sns).

## Namespace

Messaging and Queuing namespaces are now deprecated. Previously, you had to create a namespace, set to either NATS or SQS/SNS protocol, to set a scope for your queues, topics, and credentials. Now, you simply activate SQS and/or SNS and your credentials and queues are scoped to the Project it is activated in. For NATS, namespaces have been replaced by [NATS accounts](#nats-account), which set the scope for your queues and credentials.

## NATS

The **N**eural **A**utonomic **T**ransport **S**ystem, or [NATS](https://nats.io/), is an open-source messaging system written in Go. It is part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and has more than 40 client language implementations. The application has been designed with performance, scalability, and ease of use in mind.

## NATS account

A NATS account sets a scope for any NATS credentials, messages, queues and streams held within it. You can create one or multiple NATS accounts with Scaleway Messaging and Queuing. NATS accounts have replaced NATS [namespaces](#namespace).

## Protocol

Scaleway offers three protocols to use with Messaging and Queuing: [NATS](#nats), [SQS](#sqs), and [SNS](#sns). 

To create a message broker configured for the NATS protocol, you must create a [NATS account](#nats-account) and then create credentials for that account. The account gives you an endpoint/URL for your NATS message broker.

For a message broker configured for the SQS or SNS protocols, you must activate the required protocol, and then create credentials for the protocol. Once activated, you get an endpoint/URL for your SQS or SNS message broker. You can activate both protocols: in this case, you must create separate credentials for each one, and they will each have a separate endpoint/URL.

## Publish/Subscribe

Also known as "pub/sub", the publish/subscribe model provides a pattern or framework for the exchange of messages between publishers and subscribers. It contrasts with the [queuing](#queuing) model. The key feature of publish/subscribe is that messages are not sent to defined recipients. Instead, subscribers define the types of message they are interested in, and only receive messages matching their criteria. The publisher sends the message without knowing exactly who will receive it. The process of selecting which messages to receive is called [filtering](#filtering), which can be [topic-based](#topic-based) or [content-based](#content-based). The publish/subscribe model relies on a [message broker](#message-broker) to relay messages between publishers and subscribers.

## Queue

Queues facilitate asynchronous communication between different microservices, applications, and platforms. You can create a queue, configure its delivery and message parameters, and then start sending messages to it. Messages are stored in the queue until they are processed and delivered, and deleted once consumed. [Read more about creating and configuring queues](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-queues/).

## Queue types

When creating queues with Scaleway Messaging and Queuing SQS or SNS, two queue types are available. [Standard](#standard) queues provide at-least-once delivery, while [FIFO](#fifo) queues offer first-in-first-out delivery, and (unlike Standard queues) guarantee that messages are delivered in order and without duplication. [Content-based deduplication](#content-based-deduplication) is only available for FIFO queue types. Find out more about creating queues with our [dedicated documentation](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-queues/).

## Queuing

The message queuing model provides a pattern or framework for sending messages, which contrasts with the [publish/subscribe](#publishsubscribe) model. Queuing is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication. Whereas with the publish/subscribe model multiple subscribers can receive each message, with the queuing model, messages have just one destination. Messages are stored in the queue until they are processed and delivered, and they are deleted once consumed. This model is used in serverless and microservices architectures.

## Queue volume

Queue volume is one of the factors affecting the billing of Scaleway Messaging and Queuing with SQS. Queue volume is calculated as the number of messages in a queue, multiplied by the message size. Or, the sum of the size of all messages in a queue.

## Routing

In [topic-based](#topic-based) messaging, topics allow messages to be routed to the correct subscribers. Topics act as labels for each message, and the broker routes messages to subscribers who match the topic.

## SNS

The **S**imple **N**otification **S**ervice, or SNS, is a [publish/subscribe](#publishsubscribe) notification service for the mass delivery of messages. SNS acts as a single message bus that can be sent to a variety of devices and platforms through a single code interface. It is also possible to adapt message formats to the particular needs of each platform.

## SQS

The **S**imple **Q**ueue **S**ervice, or SQS, is a distributed message [queuing](#queuing) service that supports programmatic sending of messages via web service applications. The SQS protocol offers two types of message queues:
- **Standard** queues offer maximum throughput, best-effort ordering, and at-least-once delivery.
- **FIFO** queues are designed to guarantee that messages are processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent.

## SQS/SNS

SQS/SNS was previously a [namespace](#namespace) type available for Scaleway Messaging and Queuing. The two protocols have now been separated, and are now activated and deactivated separately.

## Standard

Standard-type queues and topics represent the default queue/topic type, and offer an at-least-once message delivery system. Unlike [FIFO](#fifo) queues and topics, standard queues provide only best-effort attempts to deliver messages in order. At-least-once delivery means that it is possible under rare circumstances that the same message may be received more than once.

## Stream

Distinct from traditional message brokers where messages are deleted once received/consumed, streams retain records of their events. A streaming broker is therefore often likened to a distributed append-only logs file, where every new message is added at the end of the persistent log. Each message can be delivered to one or more consumers.

## Stream volume

Stream volume is one of the factors affecting the billing of Scaleway Messaging and Queuing with NATS. Stream volume is calculated as the number of messages in a stream, multiplied by the message size. Or, the sum of the size of all messages in a stream.

## Stream persistence

Stream persistence is one of the factors affecting the billing of Scaleway Messaging and Queuing with NATS. Stream persistence is calculated as the total amount stored in a stream, multiplied by the duration it is stored for.

## Subscriber

In [publish/subscribe](#publishsubscribe) systems such as [SNS](#sns), a subscriber is the entity (e.g. SQS queue, function, URL) that messages from topics are pushed to. Subscribers can filter messages based on their topic or content.

## Topic

A topic is a communication channel used to send messages and notifications to subscribed endpoints or clients. Publishers send messages to topics, and those messages are received by subscribers. Subscribers can include Serverless Functions, SQS queues and HTTP/HTTPS endpoints. As such, topics decouple the publishing and the receiving of messages, allowing for flexibility and scalabilty in building loosely-coupled systems.

## Topic types

When creating topics with Scaleway Messaging and Queuing SQS or SNS, two topic types are available. [Standard](#standard) topics provide at-least-once delivery, while [FIFO](#fifo) topics offer first-in-first-out delivery, and (unlike Standard topics) guarantee that messages are delivered in order and without duplication. [Content-based deduplication](#content-based-deduplication) is only available for FIFO topic types. Find out more about creating topics with our [dedicated documentation](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-topics/).

## Topic-based

Topic-based messaging systems are a subset of the [publish/subscribe](#publishsubscribe) model, and contrast with [content-based](#content-based) systems. In a topic-based system, messages are published to "topics" or named logical channels. See [topic](#topic) for more information.

## Visibility timeout

Visibility timeout is a setting that can be configured for an SQS queue. It represents the length of time (in seconds) during which, after a message is received, the queue hides it, so it cannot be received again by the same or other consumers. This is useful as the queue itself does not automatically delete messages once they are received, and so prevents consumers from receiving the same message many times before they have finished processing it. Read more in our dedicated documentation on [creating queues](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-queues/).
