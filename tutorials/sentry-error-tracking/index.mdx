## Sentry - Overview

In today's fast-paced world, applications are the lifeblood of many industries. From engineers to support technicians to product managers, everyone needs to stay on top of their application's health to ensure smooth operation. That's where Sentry comes in. This powerful open-source solution is designed to monitor and track errors in applications, helping you identify issues before they become major problems. Built in Python, Sentry boasts a client/server architecture that provides real-time error reporting. And with its SDK, integrating Sentry into your applications is a breeze. You can even set it up to report errors automatically via popular messaging platforms like Slack and IRC. With Sentry by your side, you can streamline your development process, improve your applications, and give your users the seamless experience they crave.

You can find all reports on a dashboard which makes it easy to triage the problem - how often it occurs, which impact it has on the user experience of your application, which part of your code causes the problem and so on.

This tutorial details how to set up a [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) Self-Hosted server on a Scaleway Instance to start error tracking in your applications.

## Installing Sentry

In this tutorial, we will install Sentry on an [Ubuntu Jammy Jellyfish (22.04 LTS)](https://www.ubuntu.com) based Instance.

1. Update the system and install the necessary prerequisites.
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates certbot curl git gnupg-agent nginx python3-certbot-nginx sendmail software-properties-common ufw -y
    ```
2.  Install Docker's GPG key, necessary as Sentry runs in a Docker container using `docker-compose`.
    ```
    sudo mkdir -m 0755 -p /etc/apt/keyrings
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
    ```
3.  Configure Docker's software repositories to be able to install the required software on your Instance.
    ```
    echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
    $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
    ```
4. Update the apt package manager and install Docker Engine and the required plugins using `apt`.
    ```
    apt update && apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli docker-compose containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
    ```
5. Enter the `/opt` directory on your Instance and download the [latest release](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases/latest) of Self-Hosted Sentry.
    ```
    cd /opt
    wget https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/archive/refs/tags/23.2.0.tar.gz
    ```
    <Message type="note">
      At the time this tutorial was written, the latest released version was `23.2.0`.
    </Message>
6. Unpack the downloaded file using `tar`:
    ```
    tar xfz 23.2.0.tar.gz
    ```
6. Enter the `self-hosted-23.2.0/` folder and run the Sentry installer
    ```
    cd /opt/self-hosted-23.2.0/
    ./install.sh
    ```

    The automatic installer runs several compatibility tests on the system and installs Sentry. An output like the following example displays. Fill in the required information when prompted to do so:

    ```
    [...]
      Applying sites.0002_alter_domain_unique... OK
      Applying social_auth.0001_initial... OK

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    You're all done! Run the following command to get Sentry running:

      docker compose up -d

    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    ```
7. Start Sentry by running the following command.
    ```
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
8. Test the installation by pointing your web browser to `http://<your_instance_ip>:9000`. The Sentry login displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-sentry_login.webp" alt="" />

## Configuring a reverse proxy

By default, Sentry listens on port `9000`. Therefore we configure an Nginx proxy that listens on port `80` (for HTTP) and `443` (for HTTPS) and forwards all requests on these ports to port 9000.

1. Edit the file `/etc/nginx/sites-available/sentry.example.com.conf` and put the following content in it. Edit the `server_name` to the DNS name of your Sentry Instance:
    ```
        server {
          listen 80;
          server_name sentry.example.com;

          location / {
            proxy_pass         http://localhost:9000;
            proxy_redirect     off;

            proxy_set_header   Host              $host;
            proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
          }

        }
    ```
2. Create a symlink to enable the new site in Nginx.
    ```
    ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/sentry.example.com.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/sentry.example.com.conf
    ```
3. Restart `nginx` to activate the new configuration.
    ```
    service nginx restart
    ```
4. Run `certbot` to request a [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) TLS certificate for HTTPS connections to Sentry.
    ```
    certbot --nginx
    ```

    The interactive certificate creation wizard of `certbot` prompts for additional information during certificate creation:

    ```
    Enter email address (used for urgent renewal and security notices) (Enter 'c' to
    cancel): me@myemail.com <- Enter your email address

    IMPORTANT NOTES:
    - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
      /etc/letsencrypt/live/sentry.example.com/fullchain.pem
      Your key file has been saved at:
      /etc/letsencrypt/live/sentry.example.com/privkey.pem
      Your cert will expire on 2020-12-23. To obtain a new or tweaked
      version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot again
      with the "certonly" option. To non-interactively renew *all* of
      your certificates, run "certbot renew"
    - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
      configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
      secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
      also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
      making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
    - If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:

      Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt:   https://letsencrypt.org/donate
      Donating to EFF:                    https://eff.org/donate-le
    ```

## Disabling direct access to the Sentry application

We disable direct access to the Sentry application, running on port `9000` for security reasons. All requests to the application have to pass via the Nginx reverse proxy. To do this we use the [UFW firewall](/tutorials/installation-uncomplicated-firewall/).

1. Start by defining the policy, that refuses everything by default.
    ```
    ufw default deny
    ```
2. Enable outgoing traffic.
    ```
    ufw default allow outgoing
    ```
3. Authorize SSH, HTTP and HTTPS connections to the machine.
    ```
    ufw allow 22/tcp
    ufw allow 80/tcp
    ufw allow 443/tcp
    ```
4. Enable the new firewall configuration.
    ```
    $ ufw enable
    Command may disrupt existing ssh connections. Proceed with operation (y|n)? y <- type **y**
    Firewall is active and enabled on system startup
    ```

## Connecting to the Sentry interface

1. Connect from a browser: `https://sentry.example.com/` once the installation completes. 
2. Log in with the user created during the installation.
3. Provide additional information and parameters. The Sentry Dashboard displays:

4. Click **Projects** > **New Project** to create a new project.   <Lightbox src="scaleway-sentry_project.webp" alt="" />

Your Sentry server is running now, and you can integrate it with your applications. You can also add additional features by adding different [Plugins](https://docs.sentry.io/server/plugins/) into Sentry. 

Sentry is a powerful tool you can use to automate your workflow and increase the user experience by reducing the time to market of your applications. There are many [SDK's](https://docs.sentry.io/clients/) for various programming languages available.
