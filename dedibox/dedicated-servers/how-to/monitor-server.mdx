  The monitoring feature is deprecated and **no longer available** from the Dedibox console. For advanced monitoring of your server, refer to Scaleway’s [Observability Cockpit](https://www.scaleway.com/en/cockpit/).

Your management console includes a monitoring system that can notify you by e-mail or SMS when a potential incident or anomaly occurs with your server. In addition, you can also view your server's logs from the console, which shows you a history of past actions carried out on your server.
