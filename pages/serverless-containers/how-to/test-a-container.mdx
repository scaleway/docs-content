This page shows you how to execute Serverless Containers from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com). The **Test** feature of a container allows you to run your code using a selection of methods to make sure it behaves as expected.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a container](/serverless-containers/how-to/deploy-container/)

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The containers page displays.

2. Click the relevant containers namespace. A list of your containers displays.

3. Click the name of the container you want to test.

4. Open the **Test** tab.

5. Select the **method** you want to use from the drop-down menu.

6. Enter the **path** to your container. Leave the default `/` value if the host of your container is not located in a specific folder.

7. Click **+ Advanced options** to add any required HTTP header or parameter to your container.

8. Copy the generated command, then execute it in a terminal.

    <Message type="note">
    Testing a private container requires you use an [authentication token](/serverless-containers/how-to/create-auth-token-from-console/) as a header, as shown below:

    ```bash
    export $TOKEN=<YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>
    curl -H "X-Auth-Token: $TOKEN" \ <YOUR_FUNCTION_ENDPOINT>
    ````
    </Message>

The output of your terminal displays the response from your container, and the status code.

<Message type="note">
If you encounter a message error while testing your container, refer to the [dedicated troubleshooting](/serverless-containers/troubleshooting/tests-fail-on-container/) for more information.
