[Scaleway Object Storage](/object-storage/concepts/#object-storage) is an Object Storage service based on the Amazon S3 protocol. It allows you to store any objects (documents, images, videos, etc.) and access them anytime from anywhere in the world. You can manage your storage directly from the Scaleway console, to easily upload, download, and visualize the objects in your buckets. In addition, you can integrate many existing libraries or CLI clients into your application or scripts.

## Console overview
Discover the Object Storage interface on the Scaleway console.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to create a bucket

To get started with Object Storage, you must first create a bucket. Objects are gathered into buckets. Each bucket represents a space where objects are stored.

1. Click **Object Storage** on the left side menu of the console. The Object Storage dashboard displays.
2. Click **+ Create bucket**. The bucket creation page displays.
3. Select the geographical location in which to create your bucket. Scaleway Object Storage is currently available in three regions.
    - Amsterdam, The Netherlands:
      - Region: `nl-ams`
    - Paris, France:
      - Region: `fr-par`
    - Warsaw, Poland:
      - Region: `pl-waw`
4. Check **Public** or **Private** to define the bucket visibility. The bucket visibility specifies whether everyone can see the list of objects in the bucket. It does not affect [object visibility](/object-storage/concepts/#visibility).
    <Message type="note">
      A file uploaded to a public bucket is private by default.
      A private file stored in a public bucket is not publicly accessible.
      You can change the bucket visibility at any time from the **Bucket settings** tab.
    </Message>
5. Select a use case for your bucket.
6. Enter a name for your bucket.
7. Optionally, you can use the cost estimator to simulate your Object Storage costs.
8. Click **Create bucket** to confirm. A list of your buckets displays, showing the newly created bucket.

You can find more information about your bucket by clicking on its name in the **Buckets** list and then on the **Bucket settings** tab.

## How to upload files into a bucket

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. A list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the bucket name into which you want to upload your file.
3. Click the gray area to select the files you want to upload into the bucket. Alternatively, you can also drag and drop your files into the uploading area.
4. Select the files to upload from the file browser tool of your operating system.
    <Message type="important">
      Before uploading your files, make sure the file name follows the [AWS S3 Object key naming guidelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-guidelines).

5. Select the storage class of your object. Scaleway Object Storage allows you to associate storage classes with each of your objects. You can choose the storage class depending on your use case:
    - [Standard](/object-storage/concepts/#storage-class): The `Standard` class is [Multi-AZ](/object-storage/faq/#what-are-the-object-storage-classes-offered-by-scaleway), and is available in all regions. It is suitable for any use case, such as on-demand content, like streaming or CDN.
    - [One Zone - IA](/object-storage/concepts/#storage-class): The `One Zone - IA` class is available in all regions, and is a good choice for storing secondary backup copies or easily re-creatable data.
    - [Glacier](/object-storage/concepts/#storage-class): Archived storage. Your data needs to be restored first to be accessed. This class is available in the `fr-par` and `nl-ams` regions.

    <Message type="note">
      - Pricing depends on the storage class you have selected.
      - You can [edit the storage classes](/object-storage/how-to/edit-storage-class/) at any time from the Object Storage bucket dashboard.
    </Message>
A list of the bucket's objects displays, including the newly uploaded objects.

## How to download files from a bucket

1. Click the name of the bucket in the buckets list. A list of your objects displays.
2. Click the <Icon name="download" /> icon next to the object you want to download.

## How to delete a bucket

When you delete a bucket, every object stored inside it is deleted with it.

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the name of your selected bucket in the buckets list.
3. Click the **Bucket settings** tab.
4. Scroll to the end of the page and click **Delete bucket**. A pop-up appears.
5. If you understand and agree to the conditions, type **DELETE** in the box and click **Delete bucket**.

    Alternatively, you can delete a bucket by clicking the <Icon name="more" /> icon and then **Delete** in your bucket list.

Once the bucket is deleted, it disappears from your bucket list.

<Message type="note">
  For operational reasons, you have to wait 24 hours before creating a bucket with the same name as the one you have just deleted.
