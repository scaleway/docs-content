Starting **October 1st, 2025**, Cockpit will be integrated with **Scaleway IAM**, enabling you to authenticate to your Cockpit's Grafana using your **Scaleway credentials** rather than Grafana credentials.

This page explains how to prepare for the transition.


## Reasons for the change

We are simplifying authentication and improving security by:

- Removing the need to manage Grafana-specific users and passwords.
- Enabling login using your existing **Scaleway credentials**.
- Allowing central IAM-based access management.
- Supporting **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.

## Transition timeline

| Event | Date |
|------|------|
| IAM authentication becomes available | **October 1st, 2025** |
| Creating new Grafana users disabled | **October 1st, 2025** |
| Legacy Grafana user login deprecation | **January 20th, 2026** |


## What is changing?

### New login method

From **October 1st**, you will be able to log in using your Scaleway credentials via the Scaleway console or saved links.

### New dashboard URLs

To support both login methods during the transition, Grafana dashboards will have **new URLs**:

- **Old URL:**
  `https://<project_id>.dashboard.obs.fr-par.scw.cloud`

- **New URL (IAM-authenticated):**
  `https://<project_id>.dashboard.cockpit.scaleway.com`
  or
  `https://<project_id>.dashboard.cockpit.scw.cloud`

Both links will be functional until **January 20th, 2026**, after which only the new IAM-based URLs will remain valid.

## Who can access your Cockpit's Grafana?

Users must:

- Be **members** of your Scaleway Organization
- Have access to the Scaleway Project where the Cockpit is located
- Have been granted either the `ObservabilityReadOnly` or the `ObservabilityFullAccess` IAM permission set

You can manage members and permission sets in the [IAM section of the Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/members).


## How to access your Cockpit's Grafana?

### From the Scaleway console

Access to Grafana using the Scaleway console remains the same as before.

1. Click **Cockpit** in the **Monitoring** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Cockpit** overview page displays.
2. Click **Open dashboards** to open your preconfigured dashboards in Grafana. You will be automatically logged in using your Scaleway account.

### From a saved/shared link

You can also access your Cockpit's Grafana using bookmarked links, alerts, or runbooks.

1. Open the new IAM-compatible URL. The Scaleway login page displays.
2. Log in using your Scaleway credentials. Your Grafana dashboard displays.

## What will happen to existing Grafana users?

Grafana users not linked to Scaleway IAM will be deprecated. Refer to the table below to find out until when you can perform which actions.

| Action | Available until |
|--------|-----------------|
| Log in using Grafana credentials | **January 20th, 2026** |
| Generate passwords for existing Grafana users | **January 20th, 2026** |
| Create new Grafana users | **Disabled after October 1st, 2025** |

## How to prepare for this transition?

If you have users who are not in your Scaleway Organization, we recommend the following:

- **Invite them as Members** to your Organization
- Assign the `ObservabilityReadOnly` or the `ObservabilityFullAccess` permission sets only to the Projects they need to access
