You may be used to creating and managing your cloud load balancers with AWS. This document is intended to help and guide users considering migrating from AWS to Scaleway for their load balancing needs. It aims to help you understand the differences and equivalences between load balancer concepts and resource creation with AWS versus Scaleway.

## Load Balancer products and types

AWS offers several different "Elastic" Load Balancer products. Scaleway offers a single **Load Balancer** product, which can be configured in different ways to provide equivalences to the various types of AWS Elastic Load Balancer: <br/><br/>


|              | AWS Classic LB         | AWS Application LB | AWS Network LB | AWS Gateway LB | SCW LB                |
|--------------|------------------------|--------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| OSI Layer    | L4 & L7                | L7                 | L4             | L3 & L4        | L4 & L7               |
| Protocols    | HTTP, HTTPS, TCP       | HTTP, HTTPS        | TCP, TLS, UDP  | All IP traffic | HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, TLS |


## Scaleway Load Balancer features

Scaleway Load Balancer offers the following features:

**Frontend:**
- Public IPv4 and optional public IPv6 address (or private IP only)
- SSL/TLS certificate upload
- ACLs
- HTTP/3 support
- HTTP Host header and SNI routes

**Backend:**
- HTTP, HTTPS, TCP and TLS support
- Balancing between Scaleway resources (Instances, Elastic Metal servers, Dedibox) identified by public or private IP, or between non-SCW resources with selected plans 
- Configurable balancing method: round-robin, least connections, first available
- Proxy Protocol
- Sticky sessions (IP based or cookie based)
- Customizable health checks
- Backend protection
- Customized error page

**Other:**
- Compatibility with Scaleway VPC
- Compatibility with Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule and Scaleway CCM
- Caching and WAF via Edge Services

## Key concepts and naming differences

AWS and Scaleway do not always use the same wording to describe similar Load Balancer features. The table below is designed to help you translate feature and concept naming from one cloud provider's load balancer product to another:

| AWS                            | Scaleway                                      |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Target group                   | Backend servers (identified by server IPs)    |
| Listener                       | Frontend                                      |
| Listener rules                 | Route rules                                   |
| Internal Load Balancer         | Private Load Balancer                         |
| Security group                 | ACL                                           |
| Metrics with Amazon CloudWatch | Metrics with Scaleway Cockpit                 |

## Creating an AWS Load Balancer vs a Scaleway Load Balancer

The process for creating a Scaleway Load Balancer is different to that of AWS. Whereas for AWS, you must first define the target group that the load balancer will forward traffic to, with Scaleway you begin by creating the Load Balancer itself and then define the target group (server IPs) during creation of the Load Balancer's backend.

| AWS                                                      | Scaleway                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Configure target group                                | 1. Create Load Balancer (AZ, commercial type, public and/or private IP |
| 2. Choose and create load balancer type (Network / Application etc) | 2. Create and configure frontend (port)                   
| 3. Configure load balancer and listener                  | 3. Create and configure backend (port, protocol, traffic management, backend server IP addresses, advanced settings, health checks)                |
|                                                          | 4. Configure additional settings (SSL/TLS certs, ACLs, routes, HTTP3, Edge Services, additional frontends and backends etc.) |

## Other differences

Product Simplicity vs. Granularity
AWS ELB provides multiple types of load balancers with highly granular configuration options.
Scaleway Load Balancer is simpler, with most ALB/NLB features unified under a single product
Implication: Youâ€™ll trade some fine-grained controls for ease-of-use. Ideal for most use cases, but edge cases may need workarounds.

Plans and pricing?

Routing Rules Are Per Frontend
In AWS ALB, you configure listeners with rules tied to target groups.
In Scaleway, you configure a routing table per frontend, with rules based on HTTP method, host, path, etc.
âœ… The routing flexibility is similar â€” just organized differently.

SSL/TLS Management
AWS integrates SSL certificates via ACM (auto-renewal possible).
Scaleway requires manual upload of certificates.
ðŸŸ¥ Implication: You'll need a separate automation or manual process for certificate renewals unless you use wildcard Let's Encrypt certs with automation.


Recommendations for Migrating Successfully
Choose the Right LB Plan: Match features (e.g., SSL, max connections) to your needs.

Review Backend Architecture: Ensure your backends are reachable by public IP or properly configured private networks.

Automate Cert Management: Consider integrating Let's Encrypt with Scalewayâ€™s API for SSL cert renewal.

Adjust Routing Logic: Translate AWS ALB listener rules into Scaleway's route rules.

Replace ASG Target Registration: Script the backend registration if you're using autoscaling.
