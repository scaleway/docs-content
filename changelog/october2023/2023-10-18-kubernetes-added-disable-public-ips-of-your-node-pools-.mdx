Kapsule clusters can now keep or remove public IPs for new node pools!

Two options:
- **default** - controlled isolation: nodes get private endpoints and keep their public IPs, protected behind a security group (dropping inbound traffic)
- **full isolation**: nodes have only private IPs (Public Gateway required, single egress IP)

The option is immutable after pool creation. Both isolation modes can be used in the same cluster.

The feature is now available in Scaleway console (new node pools), Scaleway API, CLI and [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/scaleway/scaleway/latest/docs/resources/k8s_pool#public_ip_disabled/) (public_ip_disabled)

Find more details on our [reference documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/containers/kubernetes/reference-content/secure-cluster-with-private-network/).
