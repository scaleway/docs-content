<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [signed up to the private beta](https://www.scaleway.com/fr/betas/#distributed-data-lab) and received a confirmation email.
- Created a [Distributed Data Lab cluster](/managed-services/data-lab/how-to/create-data-lab/)
- A valid [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)

1. Click **Data Lab** under **Managed Services** on the side menu. The Distributed Data Lab page displays.

2. Click the name of the Data Lab cluster you want to connect to. The cluster **Overview** page displays.

3. Click **Open Notebook** in the **Notebook** section. You are directed to the notebook login page.

4. Enter your [API secret key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#api-key) when prompted for a password, then click **Log in**. You are directed to the lab's home screen.

5. In the files list on the left, double-click the `quickstart.ipynb` file to open it.

6. Update the first cell of the file with your API access key and secret key, as shown below:

    ```json
    "spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.access.key": "[your-api-access-key]",
    "spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.secret.key": "[your-api-secret-key]",
    ```

    Your notebook environment is now ready to be used.

7. (Optional) Follow the instructions contained in the `quickstart.ipynb` file to process a test batch of data.
