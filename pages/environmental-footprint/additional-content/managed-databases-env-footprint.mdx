This page includes the specificities of the environmental footprint calculation for Managed databases (PostgreSQL, Redis and MongoDB).

## Calculation aspects

The environmental footprint of Scaleway's Managed database products is calculated by aggregating the impact of all underlying resources dedicated to your database instances, clusters, and associated services (storage, backups, snapshots).

Since Managed Databases are built on top of other Scaleway products (Instances, Block Storage, Object Storage, Kubernetes), our methodology relies on the sum of these individual components.

### PostgresSQL and MySQL

For PostgresSQL and MySQL databases, the carbon footprint is the sum of the impact of: 
- **The nodes**: The nodes are based on Scaleway Instances. We apply the [Instance environmental footprint methodology](/environmental-footprint/additional-content/instances-env-footprint/). Each node corresponds to a specific Scaleway Instance type (e.g., a db-dev1-l database node uses a dev1-l Instance). If you use a High Availability configuration, your database runs on two nodes (a primary and a standby). Therefore, the compute impact is doubled compared to a standalone node. Each additional Read Replica counts as an additional compute node.

- **Storage volumes**: The storage attached to your database for data persistence is based on Scaleway Block Storage. We apply the [Block Storage environmental footprint methodology](/environmental-footprint/additional-content/block-storage-env-footprint/) based on the provisioned capacity (in GB).
 
- **Backups & snapshots**: Automated or manual backups are stored using Object Storage. We apply the [Object Storage environmental footprint methodology](/environmental-footprint/additional-content/object-storage-env-footprint/) based on the size of the stored backups. If you create snapshots of your database volume, we apply the [Block Storage snapshot methodology](/environmental-footprint/additional-content/block-storage-env-footprint/).

- **Control plane**: The control plane represents the shared infrastructure managed by Scaleway to orchestrate, monitor, and maintain your databases. We allocate a fixed share of the global control plane's power consumption and manufacturing impact to each active database node.


### Redis

For Redis, the carbon footprint is the sum of the impact of: 
- **The nodes**: Since Redis™ is an in-memory store, the impact is calculated based on the underlying Instances used to host your nodes. We map your Redis™ node type to its corresponding Scaleway Instance and apply the [Instance environmental footprint methodology](/environmental-footprint/additional-content/instances-env-footprint/). If you use a High Availability configuration, your database runs on two nodes (a primary and a standby). Therefore, the compute impact is doubled compared to a standalone node. If you use Cluster mode, your database impact is the impact of the total number of nodes selected in your cluster configuration (e.g., a 3-node cluster = 3 × Instance Impact).

- **Control plane**: The control plane represents the shared infrastructure managed by Scaleway to orchestrate, monitor, and maintain your databases. We allocate a fixed share of the global control plane's power consumption and manufacturing impact to each active database node.

### MongoDB

For MongoDB, the carbon footprint is the sum of the impact of:
- **The nodes**: Your MongoDB® nodes are effectively Kubernetes nodes running on specific Instance types. We apply the Kubernetes [Kapsule environmental footprint methodology](/environmental-footprint/additional-content/kubernetes-env-footprint/). As your cluster scales (adding nodes for performance or redundancy), the footprint increases linearly with the number of underlying instances reserved.

- **Storage volumes**:  The storage attached to your database for data persistence is based on Scaleway Block Storage. We apply the [Block Storage environmental footprint methodology](/environmental-footprint/additional-content/block-storage-env-footprint/) based on the provisioned capacity (in GB).

- **Snapshots**: If you create snapshots of your database volume, we apply the [Block Storage snapshot methodology](/environmental-footprint/additional-content/block-storage-env-footprint/).

- **Control plane**: The control plane represents the shared infrastructure managed by Scaleway to orchestrate, monitor, and maintain your databases. We allocate a fixed share of the global control plane's power consumption and manufacturing impact to each active database node.
