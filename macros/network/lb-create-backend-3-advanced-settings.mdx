Advanced settings are already configured for you at recommended default values. However, if you wish to modify these values you can do so by clicking the **Advanced settings** button, to access parameters for timeout values, backend protection, connection retries and S3 failover.

        For more help choosing advanced settings for your backend, see our [dedicated reference documentation](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/configuring-backends/#configuring-advanced-settings).
