This page shows how to create a Scaleway Web Hosting plan. Web Hosting is a managed service, designed for personal use, business use and everything in between. It allows you to host your website and databases and create personalized email addresses using your domain name.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Registered a domain name](/domains-and-dns/how-to/register-internal-domain/) at Scaleway or another registrar

## Web Hosting configuration

1. Click **Web Hosting** in the **Domains & Web Hosting** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Web Hosting** overview page displays.
2. Click **+ Order Web Hosting** to order a Web Hosting plan. The Web Hosting configuration screen displays.
3. Select the region in which to create your Web Hosting.
4. Choose a management interface for your website's content and settings:

    - cPanel is a web-based control panel for managing web hosting accounts, emails, and websites through a graphical interface.

    - WordPress is a user-friendly content management system (CMS) that allows you to create, edit, and manage your website without requiring any coding or technical skills.

         **If you choose WordPress as your management interface:**

         - You will receive a direct access link to your email inbox
         - Each WordPress hosting plan supports **only one website**
         - You cannot create additional databases beyond the one that is automatically provided
         Find out more about what the WordPress plan includes in the [Web Hosting FAQ](/webhosting/faq/)

      2. Select your Scaleway domain in the drop-down.
          <Message type="tip">
           If you just registered your Scaleway domain and cannot see it displayed in the drop-down, click **Reload list**.
          </Message>
      3. Tick **Use a subdomain** if you want to use an existing subdomain or to create a new one.
          <Message type="tip">
            You can use a subdomain if you want to create a separate section of your website, such as a blog or shop, if you are not using the main domain for this project.

            For example, if your main website is `my-cookies.com`, you could use a subdomain like `recipes.my-cookies.com` to create a separate section for sharing cookie recipes, while keeping your main site focused on selling cookies.
          </Message>
      4. Enter the name of your existing subdomain or a new name to create a subdomain.
      5. Choose between **Automatic DNS configuration** and **Advanced DNS configuration**
      6. Check the summary of your order and your estimated cost, then click **Order Web Hosting**.
