## Commit conventions

Lowercase only, `(module)` is optional. Project number at the end is recommended.

Here is the list of `type` to use (commons in bold)

- `docs`

- `feat`
  - _Add new materials (page, sections, â€¦)_
- `fix`
  - _For instance, fix typos, images, â€¦_

## Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.

Files with markdown content usually use the `.md` extension.

As we need to use evolved dynamic and designed blocks, at the Scaleway Documentation platform, the choice was to use the extended markdown format, with a special `.mdx` extension.

With MDX files traditional markdown content can be used with React components.

### MDX components

MDX components are useful to set rich content and interactions within your contributions.

#### Components 

This section shows code details listed in a full page.

ðŸ”Ž [See the full Components page](https://scaleway-docs.s3-website.fr-par.scw.cloud/components/).

Feel free to explore this page in your markdown editor to see how the components were used, or in `.mdx` content files that already use MDX components.

### Frontmatter

Any Markdown file that contains a YAML frontmatter block will be processed by Gatsby as a special file.  
The front matter must be the first thing in the file and must take the form of a valid YAML set between triple-dashed lines.

Here is a common example used in our `.mdx` files:

Here starts the contentâ€¦
```

- `title` is used as H1 in pages, in the html head element as the browser tab title and for SEO.
- `description` is used in pages and in the head element for SEO.
- `image` is used for Hero section image in tutorials pages. Path could be relative to file.
