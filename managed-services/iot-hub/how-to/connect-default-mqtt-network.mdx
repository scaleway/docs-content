The default network, which is automatically created with a hub, is a **MQTT network**. The default network, cannot be deleted.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created an IoT Hub](/managed-services/iot-hub/how-to/create-hub)
</Message>


1. [Add a Hub device](/managed-services/iot-hub/how-to/add-device) if you haven't already done so.

    To keep this tutorial simple, choose to `Allow Insercure` connections. Insecure connections allow connections to the hub without encryption layer.
2. Configure the physical device (or client) to connect through the network, using the following parameters:
    - **Host**: The network endpoint.
    - **Port**: Use `1883` for plaintext or `8883` for TLS.
    - **MQTT Username**: The *device ID* from the device you created earlier.
    - If your client asks for a password, just pass in an empty string.

    <Message type="note">
        If you have configured your device to force mTLS (`Deny Insecure` connections), you will also need to provide the device certificate and private key, so that during the TLS handshake, the hub will be able to verify the device identity.
    </Message>
3. Connect and exchange messages.

    Some networks support topic prefixes, but the default networks do not. The whole "topic space" is available to MQTT clients.
