This page shows how to connect to your Scaleway Elastic Metal server via SSH. Thanks to the SSH key that you created and uploaded, you can use a terminal application on your local computer to remotely connect to your Elastic Metal server as root. This enables you to use your server as you wish.

## How to connect from OSX (Mac) and Linux

1. Open a terminal program.

2. Enter the command below into the terminal. Make sure you replace `your_private_key` with the filename of your private key (often `id_rsa`) and `your_server_ip` with the IP address of your Elastic Metal server.

  ```bash
  ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_private_key root@your_server_ip
  ```

  To find the IP address of your Elastic Metal server, log into the Scaleway console and
  click **Elastic Metal** in the Compute section of the side menu. A list of your
  Elastic Metal servers and their associated IP addresses will display.

3. If / when prompted, allow connection to the host by typing `yes`, then press **Enter**.
  ```
  The authenticity of host 'myhost.ext (212.47.226.35)' can't be established.
  RSA key fingerprint is 4f:ba:65:cf:14:64:a7:1e:b6:07:7c:00:71:95:21:fa.
  Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
  ```

You are now connected to your Elastic Metal server.

## How to connect from Windows

To connect to your Elastic Metal server from Windows, you will need to use a small application called **PuTTy**, an SSH client.

1. Download and install PuTTy [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)

2. Launch PuTTy on your computer. The main screen of the application displays:

4. In the side menu, under **Connection** navigate to the **Auth** sub-category. Do this by expanding **Connection**, then **SSH** and finally clicking on **Auth**:

5. Click the **Browse** button and select the private key file you [generated previously](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/).

6. Click **Open** at the bottom of the screen to open a connection to the Elastic Metal server. Upon the first connection, PuttY asks you to allow the connection to the host.

7. Click **OK** to confirm.

   The terminal window diplays.

8. Enter the username `root` and press **Enter** to authenticate against the server with your SSH key.
