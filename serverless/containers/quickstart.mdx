Scaleway Serverless Containers provides you with containerized stateless web applications deployed in the cloud. They are designed for short-lived, event-driven tasks.

Containers rely on the HTTP protocol, and must therefore include a web server to work properly. Refer to the [differences between Containers, Jobs, and Functions](/serverless/containers/reference-content/difference-jobs-functions-containers/) for more information on Scaleway's different Serverless products.

This page explains how to deploy a basic NGINX image in a Serverless Container using the Scaleway console.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to deploy a Serverless Container

You can deploy a container from the Scaleway Container Registry or any other public container registry, such as Docker Hub, AWS Container registries, GitLab container registry, etc.

### Deploy from the Scaleway Container Registry

If you have no existing Serverless Containers resources in your current Project, the creation process will guide you through the creation of a namespace, and then a container.

<Message type="note">
  Make sure that you have [created a Container Registry namespace](/containers/container-registry/how-to/create-namespace/) and [pushed the latest NGINX Docker image](/containers/container-registry/how-to/push-images/) to it.
</Message>

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The containers page displays.
2. Click **Deploy container**. The containers namespace creation wizard displays.
3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Enter a **name** or use the automatically generated one. The name can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes.
    - Enter a **description** (optional).
    - Choose a **region**, which is the geographical location in which your namespace will be deployed.
4. Click **Create namespace and add container**. The container creation wizard displays.
    <Message type="note">
      Refer to the [How to create a Containers namespace](/serverless/containers/how-to/create-a-containers-namespace/) documentation page for more information on the different parameters.

    - Enter a **name** or use the automatically generated one. The name can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes.
    - Enter a **description** (optional).
    - Choose the smallest **resources** available to allocate to your container.
    - Leave the default **scaling** values.
    - In the **Advanced options**, set the **Container privacy policy** to **public**.
    - Verify the estimated cost.

## Going further

For advanced usage, such as larger projects with dependencies, automation, multiple containers, and more, there are [several ways to deploy containers](/serverless/containers/reference-content/deploy-container/).
