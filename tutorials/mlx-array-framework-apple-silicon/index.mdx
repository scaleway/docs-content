MLX, an array framework designed for effective and versatile machine learning on Apple silicon, was developed by Apple’s machine learning research team. It was developed by machine-learning researchers focusing on catering to their peers, emphasizing a balance between user-friendliness and efficiency in model training and deployment. The framework boasts a deliberately straightforward design that facilitates seamless extension and enhancement by researchers, fostering the swift exploration of innovative ideas.

Regarding APIs, the Python interface of MLX closely emulates NumPy, incorporating a few distinctive features. MLX also offers a robust C++ API designed closely with its Python counterpart.

Taking inspiration from frameworks such as PyTorch, Jax, and ArrayFire, MLX takes a unique path with its unified memory model. Within MLX, arrays reside in shared memory, allowing operations on MLX arrays across diverse supported devices without data copies. This approach marks a notable distinction from other frameworks.

Key features of MLX include:

* **Familiar APIs:** MLX provides a Python API closely aligned with NumPy, complemented by a comprehensive C++ API mirroring its Python counterpart. Higher-level packages like `mlx.nn` and `mlx.optimizers` closely follow PyTorch, simplifying the construction of intricate models.
* **Composable Function Transformations:** MLX facilitates composable function transformations, supporting automatic differentiation, vectorization, and optimization of computation graphs.
* **Lazy Computation:** Within MLX, computations adopt a lazy approach, only materializing arrays when needed.
* **Dynamic Graph Construction:** MLX dynamically constructs computation graphs, allowing for shape changes in function arguments without triggering sluggish compilations. Debugging remains straightforward and intuitive.
* **Multi-device Support:** MLX operations are versatile and capable of running on supported devices, currently spanning the CPU and GPU.
* **Unified Memory:** A standout distinction lies in MLX's unified memory model. Arrays within MLX reside in shared memory, permitting operations on arrays across different device types without necessitating data transfers.

## Installing MLX

To install MLX from PyPI for use on your Apple silicon computer, execute the following command from a terminal or the SSH shell:

```bash
pip3 install mlx
```

## Getting started with MLX

### MLX basics

To work with MLX, begin by importing ``mlx.core`` and creating an [`array`](https://ml-explore.github.io/mlx/build/html/python/_autosummary/mlx.core.array.html#mlx.core.array/):

```python
import mlx.core as mx
a = mx.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(a.shape)  # Output: [4]
print(a.dtype)  # Output: int32
b = mx.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
print(b.dtype)  # Output: float32
```

Operations in MLX are lazy, meaning the outputs are not computed until necessary. To enforce array evaluation, use [`eval`](https://ml-explore.github.io/mlx/build/html/python/_autosummary/mlx.core.eval.html#mlx.core.eval/). Arrays may also be automatically evaluated in specific scenarios, such as inspecting a scalar with [`array.item`](https://ml-explore.github.io/mlx/build/html/quick_start.html#:~:text=a%20scalar%20with-,array.item(/),-%2C%20printing%20an%20array), printing an array, or converting an array from [`array`](https://ml-explore.github.io/mlx/build/html/python/_autosummary/mlx.core.array.html#mlx.core.array/) to [`numpy.ndarray`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html#numpy.ndarray/).

```python
c = a + b  # c not yet evaluated
mx.eval(c)  # evaluates c
c = a + b
print(c)   # Also evaluates c
# Output: array([2, 4, 6, 8], dtype=float32)
c = a + b
import numpy as np
np.array(c)   # Also evaluates c
# Output: array([2., 4., 6., 8.], dtype=float32)
```

### Function and graph transformations

MLX supports standard function transformations like [`grad`](https://ml-explore.github.io/mlx/build/html/python/_autosummary/mlx.core.grad.html#mlx.core.grad/) and [`vmap`](https://ml-explore.github.io/mlx/build/html/python/_autosummary/mlx.core.vmap.html#mlx.core.vmap/), allowing arbitrary compositions. For instance, ``grad(vmap(grad(fn)))`` is a valid composition.

```python
x = mx.array(0.0)
print(mx.sin(x))
# Output: array(0, dtype=float32)
print(mx.grad(mx.sin)(x))
# Output: array(1, dtype=float32)
print(mx.grad(mx.grad(mx.sin))(x))
# Output: array(-0, dtype=float32)
```

Other gradient transformations include [`vjp`](https://ml-explore.github.io/mlx/build/html/python/_autosummary/mlx.core.vjp.html#mlx.core.vjp/) for vector-Jacobian products and [`jvp`](https://ml-explore.github.io/mlx/build/html/python/_autosummary/mlx.core.jvp.html#mlx.core.jvp/) for Jacobian-vector products.

Efficiently compute both a function's output and gradient concerning the function's input using [`value_and_grad`](https://ml-explore.github.io/mlx/build/html/python/_autosummary/mlx.core.value_and_grad.html#mlx.core.value_and_grad/).
