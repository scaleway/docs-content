You can manage IAM users of an Organization if you are the [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) of that Organization, or if you have sufficient permissions (via [policies](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#policy)) to do so. Management actions include adding and removing users to/from groups, attaching and detaching policies to/from users, viewing and deleting users' API keys and removing users from the Organization.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to access the user overview

1. Click **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** from the top-right of your [Organization Dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) in the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) displays.

2. Click the name of the user you want to manage. Alternatively, click <Icon name="more" /> next to the user, and select **Overview**. Either way, you are taken to the user's **Overview** tab.
    Follow the steps below depending on the management action you wish to take.

## How to view user information

From the user's [Overview tab](#how-to-access-the-user-overview), you can view information including the user's **status**, **type** (Guest or Owner), **joined on** date and whether they have [MFA](/console/account/concepts/#multifactor-authentication) enabled in the **User Information** panel at the top of the page.

On this page you can also find an extensive list of the user's permission sets, the name of their associated policies and the scope they apply to.

## How to manage a user's groups

From the user's [Overview tab](#how-to-access-the-user-overview), scroll down to the **Groups** panel. A list of the groups the user is part of displays:

<Lightbox src="scaleway-groups-overview.webp" alt="" />

### Remove a user from a group

1. Click the **x** button next to the group you want to remove the user from. A pop-up displays asking you to confirm the action.
2. Click **Remove from group** to confirm.
    <Message type="important">
      Removing a user from a group means that any permissions given to them via the group (i.e. from an attached policy) will no longer apply. Be sure you want to remove these permissions from the user before proceeding.
    </Message>

### Add a user to another group

A user may be part of multiple groups at the same time.

1. Click **Add to group** to add the user to a group. A pop-up displays, prompting you to select a group.
2. Select the group you want to add the user to from the drop-down list, or type the name of the group.
3. Click **Validate** to finish.
    The user is added to the selected group, and you are returned to the **Overview** tab.

## How to manage a user's policies

From the user's [**Overview** tab](#how-to-access-the-user-overview), scroll down to the **Policies** panel. A list of policies attached to the user displays:

<Lightbox src="scaleway-iam-policies.webp" alt="" />

### Detach a policy from a user

1. Click the **x** button next to the policy you want to detach from the user. A pop-up displays asking you to confirm the action.
2. Click **Detach policy** to confirm.
    <Message type="important">
      Since policies can only be attached to one [principal](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#principal) at a time, detaching a policy from the user means that the policy becomes orphaned. The policy will remain in your list of policies, but will have no effect until you attach it to another principal.
    </Message>

### Attach another policy to a user

A user may be attached to multiple policies.

1. Click **Attach a policy** to attach another policy to the user. A pop-up displays, prompting you to select a policy.
2. Select the policy you want to attach to the user from the drop-down list, or type the name of the policy.
3. Click **Validate** to finish.
    The selected policy is attached to the user, and you are returned to the **Overview** tab.

<Message type="tip">
  To create a new policy, see our [dedicated how to](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-policy/).
</Message>

## How to view and delete user API keys

1. From the user's [Overview tab](#how-to-access-the-user-overview), click the **Credentials** tab.
    You can view details of the user's [API keys](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/).
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-api-key.webp" alt="" />
    <Message type="note">
      You cannot see the secret key part of any API keys, nor can you create an API key for any IAM user other than yourself.
    </Message>
    If you want to delete a user's API key, proceed to the following steps:
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the API key you wish to delete, and select **Delete**.
    A warning displays, reminding you that this action is permanent.
3. Type **DELETE** and click **Submit** to confirm the action.

## How to remove a user from the Organization

<Message type="note">
  To remove any users other than yourself, you must either be the [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts#owner) of the Organization, or have [IAMManager permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/permission-sets). The exception to this is that you can always remove yourself as an IAM user from an Organization in which you are a [Guest](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts#guest), anytime. This equates to leaving the Organization. You cannot leave an Organization that you own.
</Message>

1. From the user's [**Overview** tab](#how-to-access-the-user-overview), scroll down to the **Remove user** panel:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-remove-user.webp" alt="" />
2. Click **Remove user**. A warning displays, asking you to confirm your action:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-remove-user-popup.webp" alt="A pop up box displaying a warning: Removing a user from this Organization automatically deletes their API keys, and any policies directly attached to them become orphaned" />
3. Type **REMOVE** to confirm, and click **Remove user** to validate.
