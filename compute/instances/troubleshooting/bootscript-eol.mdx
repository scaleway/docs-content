Certain older legacy Instance types (e.g. **VC1-x**, **X64-x**, **Start1-x**, and **Stardust**) offered the default option to use a bootscript (a preconfigured boot configuration) to start your Instance. This option has become deprecated and will no longer be supported.
If you are still using one of these Instance types with a bootscript, you have to change your boot configuration in order to keep your Instance operational.

## Migration options for Instances using bootscripts

<Message type="important">
  Local volume(s) that do not support UEFI cannot be used to boot any other type of Instance. You must retrieve and manually migrate your data to an Instance that supports UEFI boot.  
  Unfortunately, we cannot identify, on the Scaleway side, which customers are using OS images with or without UEFI partitions. The user themselves can only identify this.   
  To do so, [connect to your Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance) using SSH and run the following command to list the EFI directories:
  ```
  ls -ld /sys/firmware/efi
  ```
  If you can see the following output, your Instance uses UEFI boot:
  ```
  root@my-virtual-instance:~# ls -ld /sys/firmware/efi
  drwxr-xr-x 6 root root 0 Feb 20 11:16 /sys/firmware/EFI
  ```
  In this case use **option 4** to migrate your data.    
  If you see `ls: cannot access /sys/firmware/efi: No such file or directory` the UEFI directories are not present on your Instance. Migrate your data using **option 1, 2 or 3**.

### Instances using bootscript method and an old OS image without UEFI

Most of the existing **VC1-x**, **X64-x**, **Start1-x**, and **Stardust** Instances fall into this category.

#### Option 1: Create a unified snapshot of the volume(s) and rebuild block volume(s) from the snapshot

1. [Create a snapshot](/compute/instances/how-to/create-a-snapshot/) of the volume using the **unified** snapshot type.
2. [Create a new block volume](/storage/block/how-to/create-a-volume) from the previous unified snapshot.
3. [Create and start](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) a new Instance using its own boot volume in local boot mode.
4. [Attach](/storage/block/how-to/attach-a-volume/) the block volume to the new Instance.
5. Once logged into the Instance, [mount the partition](/storage/block/how-to/mount-and-use-volume/) available in the block volume and access your data.
6. Delete the old Instance that was using a bootscript once the migration is completed.

#### Option 2: Create a unified snapshot of the volume(s) and export it to S3 to retrieve the data

1. [Create a snapshot](/compute/instances/how-to/create-a-snapshot/) of the volume using the **unified** or **l_ssd** type of snapshot.
2. [Export](/compute/instances/how-to/snapshot-import-export-feature) the snapshot to an S3 bucket in the same region as the Instance.
3. Retrieve your data from the Object Storage bucket and reuse it at your convenience.
4. Delete the old Instance that was using a bootscript once you have recovered your data.

#### Option 3: Create a new Instance using the local boot method and manually copy data from the old Instance to the new one.

[Migrate the data](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/migrate-server/) of your old Instance manually. You can do this by using FTP, SCP or Rsync, for example.

<Message type="important">
  Old volumes (prior to 2018) which include QCOW backing chains are currently not supported in the unified snapshot/snapshot transfer logic. For volumes using backing chains, options 1 and 2 are not applicable.

### Instances using the bootscript method and an OS image with UEFI

#### Option 4: Change the boot type of the Instance to local boot

To continue using your current Instance, [change the boot type](/compute/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes/#how-to-use-local-boot) of the Instance to **Local boot**.

1. [Stop](/compute/instances/how-to/power-off-instance/) or [pause](/compute/instances/how-to/use-standby-mode/) the Instance.
2. [Change the boot type](/compute/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes/#how-to-use-local-boot) to local boot.
3. Start or resume execution of the Instance.
4. Check that the Instance is booting correctly with the local boot method and that its services are behaving correctly.

<Message type="tip">
  If changing the boot type from bootscript to local boot is not successfully achieved via option 4, you can always use option 1, 2 or 3 to migrate your Instance data to a new one.

<Message type="tip">
  If you are a Stardust user, we recommend that you stop the VM from the VM shell, so that the VM itself is in `stopped_in_place` state. This ensures your Instance will not lose its slot in the case of availability shortages.
