High Performance mode in Apple Remote Desktop is a connection mode designed to deliver faster screen updates and smoother interactions by using compatible hardware and optimized network conditions.
It is primarily intended for use between Macs on the same local network, ensuring minimal latency and maximum responsiveness.

## Problem

High Performance mode for Remote Desktop may fail to connect or perform as expected on hosted Mac minis.

### Symptoms

* Remote Desktop fails to establish a connection in High Performance mode.
* Connection is slow or unstable despite using a compatible Mac mini.
* Performance is poor or inconsistent despite using a compatible Mac mini.

### Possible causes

* High Performance mode requires **specific hardware and software** on both the server and client sides.
* It is designed for use on the **same local network**, and public networks can introduce latency or connectivity issues.
* macOS versions on the client or server may be outdated, reducing compatibility.

### Solution

* **Verify compatibility:**
   Ensure both server and client meet Apple's requirements for High Performance mode: [Apple Remote Desktop – Requirements](https://support.apple.com/guide/remote-desktop/use-high-performance-screen-sharing-apdf8e09f5a9/mac).

* **Update macOS:**
   Keep both your client and server macOS up to date to maximize compatibility and stability.

* **Use a virtual private network (VPN):**
   If connecting over a public network, consider establishing a **VPN or tunnel** between your client machine and the Scaleway Apple Silicon server.
   High Performance mode is designed for local network use, and a private connection can simulate this environment to improve reliability.
