import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'


<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

1. Click the **AI** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/), and select **Managed Inference** from the side menu to access the Managed Inference dashboard.
2. From the drop-down menu, select the geographical region where you want to create your deployment.
3. Click **Deploy a model** to launch the model deployment wizard.
4. Provide the necessary information:
    - Select the desired model and quantization to use for your deployment [from the available options](/managed-inference/reference-content/).
        <Message type="important">
          Scaleway Managed Inference allows you to deploy various AI models, either from the Scaleway catalog or by importing a custom model. For detailed information about supported models, visit our [Supported models in Managed Inference](/managed-inference/reference-content/supported-models/) documentation.

        <Message type="note">
          Some models may require acceptance of an end-user license agreement. If prompted, review the terms and conditions and accept the license accordingly.
        </Message>
    - Choose the geographical **region** for the deployment.
    - For custom models: Choose the model quantization.
      <Message type="tip">
        Each model comes with a default quantization. Select lower bits quantization to improve performance and enable the model to run on smaller GPU nodes, while potentially reducing precision.
      </Message>
    - Specify the GPU Instance type to be used with your deployment.
5. Choose the number of nodes for your deployment. Note that this feature is currently in [Public Beta](https://www.scaleway.com/betas/).
    <Message type="note">
      High availability is only guaranteed with two or more nodes.
    </Message>
6. Enter a **name** for the deployment, and optional tags.
7. Configure the **network connectivity** settings for the deployment:
    - Attach to a **Private Network** for secure communication and restricted availability. Choose an existing Private Network from the drop-down list, or create a new one.
    - Set up **Public connectivity** to access resources via the public internet. Authentication by API key is enabled by default.
    <Message type="important">
      - Enabling both private and public connectivity will result in two distinct endpoints (public and private) for your deployment.
      - Deployments must have at least one endpoint, either public or private.
    </Message>
8. Click **Deploy model** to launch the deployment process. Once the model is ready, it will be listed among your deployments.
