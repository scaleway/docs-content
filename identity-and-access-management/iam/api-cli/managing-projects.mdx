## Creating a project

You need your secret key and your Organization ID for the step below.

Open a terminal and type the following command to create a project. If you have not configured your environment in your local machine, make sure you replace `$SCW_SECRET_KEY` with your secret key and `$SCW_DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ID` with the ID of your Organization.
  ```
  curl -XPOST https://api.scaleway.com/account/v2/projects -H 'X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY' -d '{"organization_id":"$SCW_DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ID","name":"name-of-project"}'
  ```
An output similar to the following displays:
  ```
  {
    "id":"6170692e-7363-616c-6577-61792e636f6d",
    "name":"test-project",
    "organization_id":"3e44a89e-1f75-45f5-9b93-422db94165eb",
    "created_at":"2022-07-19T15:02:43.455727Z",
    "updated_at":"2022-07-19T15:02:43.455727Z",
    "description":""
  }
  ```

## Updating projects

You need your secret key and the ID of the project you want to update for the step below. For this use-case, we are updating the project created in the step above.
  <Message type="note">
    You can only update the name and description of your project.
  </Message>
Type the following command into your terminal to update your project:
  ```
  curl -XPATCH https://api.scaleway.com/account/v2/projects/<SCW_PROJECT_ID> -H 'X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY' -d '{"name":"new-project", "description": "This is my updated project" }'
  ```
An output similar to the following displays:
  ```
  {
    "id":"6170692e-7363-616c-6577-61792e636f6d",
    "name":"new-project",
    "organization_id":"3e44a89e-1f75-45f5-9b93-422db94165eb",
    "created_at":"2022-07-19T15:02:43.455727Z",
    "updated_at":"2022-07-19T15:29:27.762100Z",
    "description":"This is my updated project"
  }
  ```

## Listing all your projects

<Message type="note">
  - There is a default project in all Organizations.
  - The default project is named "default" and its project ID is the same as the Organization ID.
  - The default project can neither be updated nor deleted.
</Message>

You need your secret key and your Organization ID for the step below.

Type the following command into your terminal to list your projects:
  ```
  curl -XGET  https://api.scaleway.com/account/v2/projects\?organization_id\=<SCW_DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ID>&page=1&page_size=10&order_by=created_at_asc -H 'X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY'
  ```
An output similar to the following displays:
  ```
  {
    "total_count":2,
    "projects":[
      {
        "id":"3e44a89e-1f75-45f5-9b93-422db94165eb",
        "name":"default",
        "organization_id":"3e44a89e-1f75-45f5-9b93-422db94165eb",
        "created_at":"2021-07-06T15:15:48.375181Z",
        "updated_at":"2021-07-06T15:15:48.375181Z",
        "description":""
      },
      {
        "id":"6170692e-7363-616c-6577-61792e636f6d",
        "name":"new-project",
        "organization_id":"3e44a89e-1f75-45f5-9b93-422db94165eb",
        "created_at":"2022-07-19T15:02:43.455727Z",
        "updated_at":"2022-07-19T15:29:27.762100Z",
        "description":"This is my updated project"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

## Retrieving a specific project

You need your secret key and the ID of the project you want to get for the step below. For this use-case, we are getting the project we have updated in the [updating projects step](/identity-and-access-management/iam/api-cli/managing-projects/#updating-projects).

Type the following command to list a specific project.
  ```
  curl -XGET https://api.scaleway.com/account/v2/projects/<SCW_PROJECT_ID> -H 'X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY'
  ```
An output similar to the following displays:
  ```
  {
    "id":"6170692e-7363-616c-6577-61792e636f6d",
    "name":"new-project",
    "organization_id":"3e44a89e-1f75-45f5-9b93-422db94165eb",
    "created_at":"2022-07-19T15:02:43.455727Z",
    "updated_at":"2022-07-19T15:29:27.762100Z",
    "description":"This is my updated project"
  }
  ```

## Deleting a project

You need your secret key and the ID of the project you want to delete for the step below. For this use-case, we are deleting the project we have created in the [creating a project step](/identity-and-access-management/iam/api-cli/managing-projects/#creating-a-project).

1. Type the following command to delete a project.
    ```
    curl -XDELETE https://api.scaleway.com/account/v2/projects/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID> -H 'X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY'
    ```
2. Run the following command to list your projects to make sure you have deleted your project.
    ```
    curl -XGET https://api.scaleway.com/account/v2/projects\?organization_id\=<SCW_DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ID> -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY"
    ```

An output similar to the following displays, confirming that you have one project left:
  ```
  {
    "total_count": 1,
    "projects": [
      {
        "id":"3e44a89e-1f75-45f5-9b93-422db94165eb",
        "name":"default",
        "organization_id":"3e44a89e-1f75-45f5-9b93-422db94165eb",
        "created_at":"2021-07-06T15:15:48.375181Z",
        "updated_at":"2021-07-06T15:15:48.375181Z",
        "description":""
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
