This page shows you how to set up the connection to a Serverless SQL Database using the Scaleway console.

## Overview

To connect to a Serverless SQL Database, you can either use a **connection string**, or **connection parameters**.

  - A connection string provides the necessary information and parameters to establish a connection between an [IAM user](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#user) or [application](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#application) and the database. The string is written as follows:
      ```sh
      postgres://[user-or-application-id]:[api-secret-key]@[database-hostname]:5432/[database-name]?sslmode=require
      ```
      <Message type="note">
      The `?sslmode=require` is mandatory to connect to your database. Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/serverless/sql-databases/api-cli/secure-connection-ssl-tls/) for more information about SSL connection to Serverless SQL Databases.
      </Message>

  - Connection parameters provide the necessary information and parameters to connect an [IAM user](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#user) or [application](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#application) to a database. The parameters are expressed in the `KEY="value"` format, as follows:

      ```sh
      PGUSER="user-or-application-id"
      PGPASSWORD="api-secret-key"
      PGHOST="database-hostname"
      PGPORT="5432"
      PGDATABASE="database-name"
      ```

      <Message type="note">
      The `PGSSLMODE="require"` parameter is required to connect to your database, but can be omitted as it is provided by default by most SQL clients. Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/serverless/sql-databases/api-cli/secure-connection-ssl-tls/) for more information about SSL connection to Serverless SQL Databases.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created a [Serverless SQL Database](/serverless/sql-databases/how-to/create-a-database/)

## How to set up credentials

1. From the **Overview** tab of your database, click the **Set up credentials** button. The setup wizard displays.

2. Select the [principal](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#principal) to connect to the database:
    - Yourself, as an [IAM user](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#user).
    - An [application](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#application) that you [previously created](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-application/) in the IAM section of the console.
    <Message type="note">
        Refer to the [IAM documentation](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/overview/) for more information on identities and access rights.

3. Set up the **connection string** or **connection parameters**.
    <Tabs id="sdb-connect">
        <TabsTab label="With a secret key">
        <br/>
        If you already have an [API secret key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#api-key), replace the `[INSERT_SECRET_KEY_HERE]` placeholder with your **secret key** as shown below.
        - Connection string:
            ```
            postgresql://example-user-4052-8739-2017c3d9c0d9:example-secret-key-3fd8f53210ec@example-host-4d89-8e7d-g56vb754.pg.sdb.fr-par.scw.cloud:5432/serverless-sqldb-example-db?sslmode=require
            ```
        - Connection parameters:
            ```sh
            PGUSER="example-user-4052-8739-2017c3d9c0d9"
            PGPASSWORD="example-secret-key-3fd8f53210ec"
            PGHOST="example-host-4d89-8e7d-g56vb754.pg.sdb.fr-par.scw.cloud"
            PGPORT="5432"
            PGDATABASE="serverless-sqldb-example-db"
            ```
        </TabsTab>
        <TabsTab label="Without a secret key">
        <br/>
        If you do not have an [API secret key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#api-key), click **Generate new secret key**.
        
        A new secret key is created, and inserted directly into the connection string and parameters.
        </TabsTab>
    </Tabs>
4. Copy your connection string or parameters and store them securely, as they will only be shown once.

## How to connect to a database as a user

1. Run the following command in a terminal (including the `"` characters):

    ```sh
    psql "[YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING]"
    ```

    An output similar to the following response displays:

    ```sql
    psql (15.3, server 14.8 (Debian 14.8-1pgsg120+1))
    SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, compression: off)
    Type "help" for help.
    ```

2. Run the following command to see the version of your Serverless SQL Database:

    ```sql
    SELECT version();
    ```

    An output similar to the following displays:

    ```
    PostgreSQL 14.8 (Debian 14.8-1.pgdg120+1) on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu,
    compiled by gcc (Debian 12.2.0-14) 12.2.0, 64-bit
    ```

3. Press `q` to quit the version overview.

You can now perform the authorized actions in the database.

## How to connect an application to a database

Use the connection parameters (host, port, user, password, and database name) previously saved to connect your application to the database.

<Message type="note">
  Connection methods may vary depending on the framework or library used in your application. Refer to our [dedicated documentation](/serverless/sql-databases/api-cli/secure-connection-ssl-tls/) on securing connections with SSL/TLS, and to the corresponding official documentation for more information.
