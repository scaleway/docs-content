## Understanding Platforms & billing
Scaleway offers different "Platforms" for emulation, ranging from standard CPU instances to high-end GPU clusters.

* **Platform selection**: When you choose a backend (e.g., EMU-AER-H100), Scaleway dynamically allocates the requested resource.
* **Session & billing**: Behind the scenes, a Session is created for your computation. Unlike QPU "shots", emulation is typically billed based on the duration of resource usage (similar to renting a cloud instance). This makes it cost-effective for running massive batches of shots or debugging complex algorithms.
* **End of billing**: It stops when you terminate your Session or after a timeout.

<Message type="tip"> Performance Tip: The service automatically handles data compression. This is particularly useful when running algorithms like QML (Quantum Machine Learning) or Variational Algorithms (VQE/QAOA) where large amounts of parameters and results are exchanged between the classical client and the quantum backend. </Message>

## Understanding platform names

Scaleway exposes AQT resources via two distinct Platform IDs that you must specify when selecting a backend:

* **`QPU-IBEX-12PQ`**: This connects you to the **real trapped-ion quantum computer** located at AQT's headquarters, in Innbruck. Use this for final runs and validatable experiments.
* **`EMU-IBEX-12PQ-L4`**: This connects you to a **noisy emulator** hosted on Scaleway's L4 GPU instances. It mimics the IBEX connectivity and gates but runs classically. Use this for debugging and testing your code logic before paying for real quantum shots.
