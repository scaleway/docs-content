## Problem
I can't connect to my FTP account.

### Symptoms
- FTP login fails with an authentication error.
- Your FTP client cannot establish a connection.
- File uploads or downloads are interrupted frequently.

## Possible causes
- Incorrect FTP credentials.
- Passive mode is required but not enabled.
- Your firewall or ISP is blocking FTP ports.

## Solution

#### Check your FTP credentials
- Double-check your FTP username, password, and hostname on the hosting panel.
- Ensure you are using the correct protocol (FTP, SFTP) as required by your hosting provider.
- If you recently [changed your password](/webhosting/how-to/manage-ftp-accounts/#how-to-update-the-password-of-an-ftp-account), update it in your FTP client.

#### Enable passive mode
- Some networks require **passive mode** for FTP connections.
- In your FTP client settings, look for a **Connection Mode** option and select **Passive Mode** instead of **Active Mode**.

#### Check firewall and network settings
- Ensure port **21** (FTP) is open in your firewall settings.
- Some ISPs block FTP connections; try switching to **SFTP** (port 22) if available.

#### Test with an alternative FTP client
- If the issue persists, try using another FTP client (e.g., [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/), [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php), or [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/)) to rule out client-specific problems.

#### Restart your router and check ISP restrictions
- Restart your router to refresh network settings.
- Contact your ISP to confirm if FTP connections are restricted or blocked.
