Transactional Email (TEM) dedicated IPs are IP addresses assigned to a single sender. This allows the sender complete control over their sending reputation without having to manage the technical complexity related to IP optimization and monitoring.

Unlike shared IPs where multiple users share the same reputation, a dedicated IP offers total control over reputation and deliverability, less impact from other senders, and better deliverability on sensitive domains (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, etc.).

TEM dedicated IPs are available with the [TEM Scale plan](/transactional-email/concepts#scale-plan) and are managed by Scaleway. This means that the TEM team takes care of optimizing and monitoring the dedicated IPs.
