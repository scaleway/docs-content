This page explains how to create a file system using the Scaleway console.

1. Click **File Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The [File Storage dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/file-storage/) displays.

2. Click **+ Create File system**. The [file system creation page](https://console.scaleway.com//file-storage/file-storage/create) displays.

3. Complete the following steps:
    - Select the region in which your file system will be created. It will be accessible by [Instances](/instances/) within the same [region](/file-storage/concepts/#region).
    - Enter a name for your file system, or use the automatically generated one. The name of your file system can only contain alphanumeric characters, spaces, and dashes.
    - Enter a size for your file system. Billing is based on the size provisioned here, and not actual usage.

4. Review the estimated cost, then click **Create file system**.

The **Overview** page of your newly created file system displays.
