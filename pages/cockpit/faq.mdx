## What is Cockpit?

Cockpit is a monitoring and alerting solution designed for multi-source observability. Cockpit allows you to collect, store, and analyze metrics and logs from your infrastructure and applications, giving you insights into your system's performance and behavior.
Cockpits are scoped per [Project](/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project).

## How does Cockpit integrate with other Scaleway products?

Cockpit integrates seamlessly with Scaleway’s ecosystem. It provides pre-built dashboards in Grafana, and alerts to monitor other Scaleway resources' performance.

Refer to the [dedicated documentation page](/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-limitations/#product-integration-into-cockpit) for the whole list of Scaleway resources integrated with Cockpit.

## How am I billed for using Cockpit with my Scaleway data?

Using Cockpit with your Scaleway data is free of charge.

The retention period you set for your data - whether from [Scaleway resources integrated with Cockpit](/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-limitations/#product-integration-into-cockpit) or custom data - will be free of charge.

Additional costs apply for sending custom data to Cockpit. This means that you will be billed for sending **data from Scaleway resources that are not integrated with Cockpit**, or data from any other external resources.

## How am I billed for using Cockpit with custom data?

Custom data is any data that is external to Scaleway, or **data from Scaleway resources not integrated with Cockpit**. Refer to the [dedicated documentation page](/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-limitations/#product-integration-into-cockpit) to find out which resources are integrated with Cockpit.

During the beta of the retention period edition feature, the retention period you set for your custom data is free of charge.

You will not be charged for **querying** custom data.

Data ingestion is billed as follows:

- Custom metrics are billed €0.15 per million samples of metrics ingested, per month.
- Custom logs are billed €0.35 per GB ingested, per month.
- Custom traces are billed €0.35 per GB ingested, per month.

Scaleway applies volume discounts to bill custom metrics. This means that the monthly pricing for custom metrics will be calculated in levels. **Scaleway applies six levels of volume discounts.**

| Levels       | Range                                        | Monthly pricing with volume discounts    |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Level one    | From 0 to 10 billion custom metrics          | €0.15 per million samples                |
| Level two    | From 10 to 25 billion custom metrics         | €0.13 per million samples                |
| Level three  | From 25 to 50 billion custom metrics         | €0.12 per million samples                |
| Level four   | From 50 to 100 billion custom metrics        | €0.11 per million samples                |
| Level five   | From 100 to 200 billion custom metrics       | €0.10 per million samples                |
| Level six    | From 200 billion custom metrics and beyond   | €0.08 per million samples                |


Here is an example of how you would be billed for **sending 52 billion custom metrics samples per month**:

Here is an example of how you would be billed for sending 52 billion custom metrics samples per month:
- 10 billion samples at €0.15 per million samples: €1.500
- 15 billion samples at €0.13 per million samples: €1.950
- 25 billion samples at €0.12 per million samples: €3.000
- 2 billion samples at €0.11 per million samples: €220

**Total:** €6.650 per month with volume discounts instead of €7.800 without volume discounts.

## Why are Cockpit pricing plans being deprecated?

From January 1st 2025, Cockpit is transitioning away from fixed pricing plans to offer you more flexibility and granularity for managing data [retention](/cockpit/concepts/#retention).

This change allows you to tailor retention settings to your specific needs. We hope to enhance your experience by providing more customizable options without immediate cost impact, as changing data retention period will be free during Beta.

Find out [how to change data retention period](/cockpit/how-to/change-data-retention/) in the dedicated documentation.

## How do I send my own data to my Cockpit?

If you have set up an agent, you can send your data using our [dedicated documentation](/cockpit/how-to/send-metrics-logs-to-cockpit/).


If you have not set up an agent, check out our [documentation](/cockpit/how-to/send-metrics-with-grafana-alloy/) to find out how to
configure the Grafana Alloy agent, push your data, and visualize it in Grafana.

## Which Scaleway products are integrated into Cockpit?

Find out which Scaleway products are integrated into Cockpit in our [capabilities and limits documentation page](/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-limitations/#product-integration-into-cockpit).

Refer to our [documentation on understanding Cockpit usage and pricing](/cockpit/reference-content/understanding-cockpit-usage/) for more information on how to reduce extra costs.

<Message type="important">
 Sending metrics and logs for Scaleway resources or personal data using an external path is a billable feature. In addition, any data that you push yourself is billed, even if you send data from Scaleway products. Refer to the [product pricing](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/?tags=available,managedservices-observability-cockpit) for more information.

## Will my dashboards be impacted by the Cockpit regionalization?

Soon, a new version of Cockpit will be released. In this version, the concept of **regionalization** will be introduced to offer you more flexibility and resilience for seamless monitoring.

If you have created customized dashboards with data for your Scaleway resources before April 2024, you will need to update your queries in Grafana, with the new regionalized data sources.
