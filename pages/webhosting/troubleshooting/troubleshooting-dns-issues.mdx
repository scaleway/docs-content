## Problem
You are experiencing DNS-related errors with your Scaleway Web Hosting service.

### Symptoms
- Your domain does not resolve to the correct IP address.
- You receive DNS resolution failures (e.g., `DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN`).
- DNS changes take longer than expected to propagate.
- Website remains inaccessible even after updating DNS records.

## Possible causes
- Incorrect DNS settings configured in Scaleway Web Hosting.
- Delayed DNS propagation due to TTL values.
- Domain registrar nameservers not correctly set.
- Caching issues affecting DNS resolution.

## Solution

#### Verify your DNS configuration
- Ensure your domain points to the correct Scaleway Web Hosting IP.
- Use Scalewayâ€™s recommended nameservers and DNS settings.
- Double-check that your A, CNAME, and MX records are properly set.
- Refer to [Scaleway's DNS Configuration Guide](/webhosting/how-to/configure-dns-webhosting/) for details.

#### Check for conflicting DNS settings
- Ensure no conflicting records exist (e.g., multiple A or CNAME records pointing to different servers).
- Remove outdated or incorrect entries.

#### Allow time for DNS propagation
- DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate globally.
- Check propagation status using tools like [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org/).

#### Clear DNS cache
- On your local machine, flush the DNS cache:
  - Windows: Run `ipconfig /flushdns` in Command Prompt.
  - macOS: Run `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache` and `sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder` in Terminal.
  - Linux: Restart the DNS service or use `sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches`.
- Restart your browser or try using a different network.

#### Test local DNS resolution
Use the `nslookup` or `dig` command to check domain resolution.
  - Example:
     ```sh
     nslookup yourdomain.com
     dig yourdomain.com +short
     ```
If incorrect records appear, wait for propagation or reconfigure your DNS settings.
