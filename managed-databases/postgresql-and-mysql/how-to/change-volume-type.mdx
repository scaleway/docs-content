It is possible to change your [volume type](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/concepts/#volume-type) anytime in the Scaleway console.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [PostgreSQL or MySQL Database Instance](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/quickstart) with local storage

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the name of the Database Instance you want to edit. The database's Overview page displays.
3. Scroll down to **Volume settings**, then click **Change volume type**.
    <Message type="important">
      Before changing the volume type, make sure your Instance is in one of the following states:
      - `READY` (represented as "Running" in the Scaleway console)
      - `DISK_FULL`
    </Message>
    A pop-up appears.
4. Select **Block Storage** from the drop-down menu.
5. Click **Update volume type** to confirm.

    The Database Instance goes into the `Initializing` state.

    <Message type="important">
      If you are changing from a Block to a local volume, make sure to select a node with  a local storage size greater than or equal to your current Block Storage.
    </Message>
