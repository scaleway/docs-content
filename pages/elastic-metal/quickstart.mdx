Scaleway Elastic Metal are dedicated physical servers you can order on-demand, like Instances. These servers are ideal for large workloads, big data, and applications that require increased security and dedicated resources. You can install an OS or other [image](/elastic-metal/concepts/#image) on your Elastic Metal server and connect to it via SSH to use it as you require. You can power off the server when you are not using or delete it from your account once you have finished with it.

## Console overview
Discover the Elastic Metal interface on the Scaleway console.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)

## How to create an Elastic Metal server

1. Go to **Elastic Metal** in the **Bare Metal** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Elastic Metal server creation page displays.
2. Click **Create Elastic Metal server**. The server creation wizard will launch.
3. Complete the server creation wizard:
    - Select the geographical region for your server by choosing an Availability Zone.
      <Message type="note">
        Currently, Elastic Metal servers are available in:
        - Amsterdam, Netherlands (`AMS-1`, `AMS-2`)
        - Paris, France (`PAR-1`, `PAR-2`)
        - Warsaw, Poland (`WAW-2`, `WAW-3`)
      </Message>
    - Choose your preferred billing method: **hourly** or **monthly**.
      <Message type="tip">
        You can update the billing period to monthly at any time after your server has been delivered. [Learn more.](/elastic-metal/how-to/change-billing-period/)
      </Message>
    - Select a server configuration from the available options.
    - Choose an OS to run on your server or opt for no preinstalled image.
    - Configure server partitioning. You can either choose a default configuration or [configure your own partitioning](/elastic-metal/how-to/configure-disk-partitions/) using a JSON configuration.
    - Enter a name and, optionally, add tags to identify your server.
    - Add your SSH key (required if installing an image on your server). Depending on the OS image, you may also be asked to configure the panel user for your server.
    - Optionally, configure the available public bandwidth for your server. This option may not be available for all offers.
    - Optionally, decide whether to enable the Private Networks feature. [Learn more about Private Networks](/vpc/concepts/#private-networks)
    - Review the estimated environmental footprint of your Elastic Metal server.
      <Message type="note">
        For a detailed report of how the environmental impact of Scaleway services is calculated, refer to the [Environmental Footprint calculator breakdown](/environmental-footprint/additional-content/environmental-footprint-calculator) documentation page.
      </Message>
    - Review the estimated cost based on your selected configuration.
