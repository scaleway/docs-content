Reverse DNS (rDNS) is the opposite of classic forward DNS, mapping an IP address to a hostname. This is particularly useful for tasks such as sending emails from your Elastic Metal server.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or appropriate [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) for actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An [installed Elastic Metal server](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/quickstart/#how-to-create-an-elastic-metal-server)
- A [flexible IP address](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/attach-detach-flexible-ip/) attached to your Elastic Metal server

  Ensure that a corresponding `A-Record` (IPv4) or `AAAA-Record` (IPv6) pointing to the IP address exists before editing the reverse DNS.

1. Click **Elastic Metal** in the **Bare Metal** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Elastic Metal dashboard displays.
2. Click the **Flexible IPs** tab to display the list of your failover IPs for Elastic Metal servers.
3. Click **More** (<Icon name="more" />) next to the flexible IP you want to configure. The configuration menu for the flexible IP displays.
4. Click **More info** to see detailed information about the IP address.
5. Scroll down to the **Reverse** section and click **Add reverse** to add or edit the reverse DNS of the failover IP.
   <Message type="note">
      If a reverse DNS is already set on your failover IP, the button will be labeled **Edit reverse**.
   </Message>
6. Enter the new reverse DNS and click **Edit reverse** to validate the changes.
   <Message type="important">
      When configuring the reverse DNS for a flexible IPv6, the configuration applies to the first IP (`XXXX:0`) of the /64 IP block.
