This page shows you how to temporarily mute (silence) alerts without disabling them from Grafana. A silence temporarily mutes alerts that match a specific set of labels.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created](/cockpit/how-to/create-external-data-sources/) data sources
- [Enabled](/cockpit/how-to/enable-alert-manager/) the alert manager
- [Retrieved](/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/) your Grafana credentials
- [Configured](/cockpit/how-to/configure-alerts-for-scw-resources/) alerts for your resources (preconfigured or custom)


1. [Access](/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards/) your Grafana dashboard.
2. Click the **Toggle menu** icon next to **Home** in the top left corner of your screen.
3. Click **Alerting**, then **Silences**. Make sure that **Scaleway Alerting** is selected in the **Choose Alertmanager** drop-down.
4. Click **Create silence**.
5. Click the drop-down in the **Silence start and end** section.
6. Click the **Calendar** icon and select a time range during which you want to silence alerts.
7. Click **Apply time range**.
8. Enter a label to match your silence with the alert you want to target. Optionally, click **+ Add matcher** to add more. The alert affected by this silence should display.
    <Message type="tip">
     Matchers define which alerts are silenced. Each matcher includes a **Label** (e.g. `alertname`), an **Operator** (`=`, `!=`, `=~`, or `!~`), and a **Value** (e.g. `alert-for-high-cpu-usage`).
    </Message>
    <Lightbox image={image} alt="Silence configuration for the high CPU usage Grafana alert. The time range of the silence is of a week starting from June 16th" />
9. In the **Comment** section, describe why you are configuring the silence.
10. Click **Save silence** to confirm. Your silence displays in the list.
    <Message type="tip">
     To stop silencing an alert, click **Unsilence** under the **Actions** column
     <Lightbox image={image2} alt="Grafana Silences page with an active silence and the Unsilence button highlighted." />
     The silence will display in a section named **Expired silences**, and be deleted after 5 days.
