## How to delete a VPC

You can only delete VPCs that:
- Do not contain any Private Networks or IPAM reserved IPs
- Are not the [default VPC](/vpc/concepts/#default-vpc) for their region

1. Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of your VPCs displays:

    <Lightbox image={image} alt="" />

2. Either:
    - Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the VPC you want to delete, and select **Delete** from the drop-down menu, or
    - Click the name of the VPC you want to delete to access its **Overview** page, then scroll to the bottom of the dashboard and click **Delete VPC**.

3. Type **DELETE** in the box to confirm, then click **Delete VPC**.
