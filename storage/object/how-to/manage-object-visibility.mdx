Object visibility specifies whether your object is visible to others or not, independently from [bucket visibility](/storage/object/concepts/#visibility).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)

<Message type="note">
  All objects are private by default, even if they are in a public bucket. A private file in a public bucket cannot be accessed publicly.
</Message>

## Manage the visibility of a single object

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the name of your bucket. A list of your objects displays.
3. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the selected object name.
4. Click **Visibility**. A pop-up appears.
5. Check **Public** or **Private** according to your preference.
6. Click **Update object visibility** to confirm.

<Message type="tip">
If you upload a file using the CLI, you can make it public by using the `--acl public-read` parameter. However, [bucket policies](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/) take precedence over ACLs.
</Message>

## Manage the visibility of multiple objects

You can manage the visibility of multiple ojects at a time using a [bucket policy](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/) as shown below. By allowing [GetObject](/storage/object/api-cli/object-operations/#getobject) operations to everyone, the desired objects can be accessed by any person with the link to the object.

```json
{
  "Id": "object-visibility",
  "Version": "2023-04-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "make-objects-visible",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": [
        "my-bucket/public-objects"
        ]
    },
  ]
}
```
