In this article, we will learn how to back up data from a Scaleway Instance, using [Scaleway's Object Storage](/storage/object/quickstart/) service and Duplicity. [Duplicity](https://duplicity.gitlab.io/) is a free and open-source tool that backs up folders to a remote server, in this case, an Object Storage bucket. Using libsync and GPG, Duplicity can make space-efficient encrypted backups.

Our objectives are to:

- Make production-ready automatic backups of our data.
- Save cost using bandwidth and space-efficient incremental backups.
- Preserve a robust layer of security and privacy with asymmetrical encryption.

To achieve this, we will:

- Create a bucket in Scaleway's Object Storage
- Install [Duplicity](https://duplicity.gitlab.io/)
- Generate a GPG key
- Combine Duplicity and Scaleway Object Storage

Although this tutorial focuses on backing up an Instance, you can also back up a dedicated server with Duplicity. When you are using a [Scaleway Dedibox](https://www.scaleway.com/fr/dedibox/) or a [Scaleway Elastic Metal server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/elastic-metal/), the data transfer is free of charge within the same region.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
- An [Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) running Ubuntu or Debian 

## Creating an Object Storage bucket

Follow the instructions to [create an Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/). This bucket will be used to back up your Instance's data.

## Installing software requirements

In this step, we install the various software needed. As well as installing Duplicity itself, Duplicity needs us to generate a [GPG key](https://www.gnupg.org/) so that it can encrypt the data. For GPG key generation, we need to create some entropy, so we also install [Haveged](http://www.issihosts.com/haveged/) to generate a small amount of entropy.

  You can find the link to the latest version of Duplicity on their [website](https://duplicity.gitlab.io/). You may replace the link used with `wget` (and therefore `tar` and `cd`) if a newer version is available.
</Message>

Run the following command to update the APT package manager, upgrade the software already installed on the server and download and install Duplicity and the other required software:

```bash
    apt update && apt upgrade
    apt install -y python3-boto python3-pip haveged gettext librsync-dev
    wget https://gitlab.com/duplicity/duplicity/-/archive/rel.2.1.2/duplicity-rel.2.1.2.tar.gz
    tar xaf duplicity-rel.2.1.2.tar.gz
    cd duplicity-rel.2.1.2/
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    python3 setup.py install
```

## Creating a GPG key

1. Generate the GPG key with the following command.
    ```bash
    gpg --full-generate-key
    ```

    Enter and remember a passphrase.
    You are asked to define the characteristics of your keys. We go with the default settings:

    - What kind of key you want: (1) RSA and RSA (default)
    - What key size you want: (3072)
    - How long the key should be valid: 0 = key does not expire

    GPG then asks for a name for your key, an address, and a description.

    ```bash
    gpg --full-generate-key

    gpg (GnuPG) 2.1.18; Copyright (C) 2017 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
    There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

    Please select what kind of key you want:
      (1) RSA and RSA (default)
      (2) DSA and Elgamal
      (3) DSA (sign only)
      (4) RSA (sign only)
    Your selection? 1

    RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
    What keysize do you want? (3072) 3072
    Requested keysize is 3072 bits

    Please specify how long the key should be valid.
      0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
    Key is valid for? (0) 0
    Key does not expire at all
    Is this correct? (y/N) y

    GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

    Real name: backups
    Email address: me@scaleway.com
    Comment: Scaleway Object Storage backups
    You selected this USER-ID:
      backups (Scaleway Object Storage backups) <me@scaleway.com>

    Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
    We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
    some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
    disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
    generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

    gpg: key XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX marked as ultimately trusted
    public and secret key created and signed.
    pub   rsa3072  2020-03-26 [SC]
      XXXXXXXXXXXXX-FINGERPRINT-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    uid                      backups (Scaleway Object Storage backups) <me@scaleway.com>
    sub   rsa3072  2020-03-26 [E]
    ```
2. Copy the GPG key fingerprint (its location in the output is shown above), which could be an 8, 16 or 40 char long hash. You can also find the fingerprint of your key with the following command:
    ```bash
    gpg --list-keys
    gpg: checking the trustdb
    gpg: marginals needed: 3  completes needed: 1  trust model: pgp
    gpg: depth: 0  valid: 1  signed: 0  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 1u
    /home/me/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
    ------------------------------

      pub rsa3072 2020-03-26 [SC]
        XXXXXXXXXXXXX-FINGERPRINT-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
      uid 		[ultimate] backups (Scaleway Object Storage backups) <me@scaleway.com>
      sub rsa3072 2020-03-26 [E]
      ```

<Message type="tip">
  If you lose access to your current server, having the GPG private and public keys stored somewhere else will come in handy. Export the GPG keys with:
  ```bash
  gpg --armor --export backups
  gpg --armor --export-secret-key backups
  ```

## Combining Duplicity and Scaleway

As everything is installed and ready, we will now configure and script our interactions between our server and the cloud.

### Editing the configuration

1. Create our initial, empty script files and log files and make them executable.
    ```bash
        touch scw-backups.sh scw-restore.sh .scw-configrc
        chmod 700 scw-backups.sh scw-restore.sh
        chmod 600 .scw-configrc

        mkdir -p /var/log/duplicity
        touch /var/log/duplicity/logfile{.log,-recent.log}
    ```
2. Add the following lines to `.scw-configrc`. Make sure you replace the necessary values with the details of your Scaleway API key, Object Storage bucket, and GPG key. You also need to enter a path to the desired backup folder:
    ```bash
    # Scaleway credentials keys
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<SCALEWAY ACCESS KEY>"
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<SCALEWAY SECRET ACCESS KEY>"

    export SCW_REGION="<REGION OF YOUR BUCKET>"
    export SCW_ENDPOINT_URL="https://s3.${SCW_REGION}.scw.cloud"

    # set SCW_BUCKET as follows for duplicity < 0.8.23
    # for higher versions, see below
    # export SCW_BUCKET="s3://s3.${SCW_REGION}.scw.cloud/<NAME OF YOUR BUCKET>"

    # set the next two variables for duplicity >= 0.8.23
    # it uses the boto3 library, which uses a different naming scheme for bucket names
    export SCW_BUCKET="s3://<NAME OF YOUR BUCKET>"

    # GPG Key information
    export PASSPHRASE="<YOUR GPG KEY PASSPHRASE>"
    export GPG_FINGERPRINT="<YOUR GPG KEY FINGERPRINT>"

    # Folder to backup
    export SOURCE="<PATH TO FOLDER TO BACKUP>"

    # Will keep backup up to 1 month
    export KEEP_BACKUP_TIME="1M"

    # Will make a full backup every 10 days
    export FULL_BACKUP_TIME="10D"

    # Log files
    export LOGFILE_RECENT="/var/log/duplicity/logfile-recent.log"
    export LOGFILE="/var/log/duplicity/logfile.log"

    log () {
      date=`date +%Y-%m-%d`
      hour=`date +%H:%M:%S`
      echo "$date $hour $*" >> ${LOGFILE_RECENT}
    }
    export -f log
    ```

The backup policy described here makes a full backup every 10 days and removes all backups older than one month.

### Backup script

Using the configuration and Duplicity, we automatize the backup process with the `scw-backups.sh` script. 

1. Copy the following script to `scw-backups.sh`:
    ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        source <FULL PATH TO>/.scw-configrc

        currently_backuping=$(ps -ef | grep duplicity  | grep python | wc -l)

        if [ $currently_backuping -eq 0 ]; then
          # Clear the recent log file
          cat /dev/null > ${LOGFILE_RECENT}

          log ">>> removing old backups"
          duplicity remove-older-than \
            --s3-endpoint-url ${SCW_ENDPOINT_URL} \
            --s3-region-name ${SCW_REGION} \
            ${KEEP_BACKUP_TIME} ${SCW_BUCKET} >> ${LOGFILE_RECENT} 2>&1

          # duplicity >= 0.8.23
          # determine S3_ENDPOINT_URL for scaleway
          S3_ENDPOINT_URL="https://s3.${S3_REGION_NAME}.scw.cloud"

          log ">>> creating and uploading backup to Scaleway Glacier"
          duplicity \
          incr --full-if-older-than ${FULL_BACKUP_TIME} \
          --asynchronous-upload \
          --s3-use-glacier \
          --s3-endpoint-url ${SCW_ENDPOINT_URL} \
          --s3-region-name ${SCW_REGION} \
          --encrypt-key=${GPG_FINGERPRINT} \
          --sign-key=${GPG_FINGERPRINT} \
          ${SOURCE} ${SCW_BUCKET} >> ${LOGFILE_RECENT} 2>&1

          cat ${LOGFILE_RECENT} >> ${LOGFILE}
        fi
    ```

2. Run the script `./scw-backups.sh` to make sure the configuration is correctly set. Check the Object Storage bucket on the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) to see the backup files, or examine the logs with the following command:
    ```bash
    cat /var/log/duplicity/logfile-recent.log
    ```

### Script the recovery of data

Duplicity also allows you to recover a backup. We will create a script to make the process easier. 

1. Add the following script to `scw-restore.sh`:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    source <FULL PATH TO>/.scw-configrc

      if [ $# -lt 2 ]; then
        echo -e "Usage $0 <time or delta> [file to restore] <restore to>
    Exemple:
    \t$ $0 2018-7-21 recovery/  ## recovers * from closest backup to date
      \t$ $0 0D secret data/  ## recovers most recent file nammed 'secret'";
      exit; fi

      if [ $# -eq 2 ]; then
        duplicity \
          --s3-endpoint-url ${SCW_ENDPOINT_URL} \
          --s3-region-name ${SCW_REGION} \
          --time $1 \
          ${SCW_BUCKET} $2
      fi

      if [ $# -eq 3 ]; then
        duplicity \
          --s3-endpoint-url ${SCW_ENDPOINT_URL} \
          --s3-region-name ${SCW_REGION} \
          --time $1 \
          --file-to-restore $2 \
          ${SCW_BUCKET} $3
      fi
      ```
2. Recover the data you uploaded in the previous section with the following command:
    ```bash
        ./scw-restore.sh 0D /tmp/backup-recovery-test/
    ```
3. Alternatively, recover one specific file with the following format from a backup 5 days ago with:
    ```bash
        ./scw-restore.sh 5D <file> /tmp/backup-recovery-test/
    ```

### Automation of the backups

1. Use the command `crontab -e` to edit your crontab file and add the line to create a script that will run twice a day at 1:00 and 13:00 (1 AM and 1 PM) :
    ```bash
        crontab -e
    ```
2. Select your editor and write:
    ```bash
        PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
        SHELL=/bin/bash
        00 1,13 * * * <FULL PATH TO>/scw-backups.sh > /dev/null 2>&1
    ```

## Conclusion

We created an automatic backup using Duplicity, hosting the encrypted data on Scaleway’s Object Storage. We are able to recover specific files or the entire backup itself at a given date.

To continue your implementation, you may want to consider the following:

- [Duply](https://duply.net/), giving you a front-end view of the backups.
- Backing up more than one folder using `“SOURCE=/”` and the `--include=` and `--exclude=` options of duplicity.
- Adapt the backup policy with more frequent backups, that are conserved.
