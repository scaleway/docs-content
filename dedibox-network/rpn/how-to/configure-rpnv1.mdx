## How to create a new RPNv1 group from the Scaleway console

1. Click **RPN** > **RPN groups** in the navigation bar on top of your console to enter the [RPN groups configuration](http://console.online.net/en/server/rpn) page.

2. Click **Create group** to create a new RPN group. The group creation interface displays.

3. Enter a name for your RPN group, select the Dedibox servers you want to add to the group and then save.

    It takes about five to ten minutes to activate a new RPNv1 group. Once the group is enabled, its status changes to **active**.

<Message type="note">

  The owner of the server external to your account receives an email to confirm the sharing of the RPN group. You can not reach any external server until the RPN sharing has been confirmed by the servers' owner.
