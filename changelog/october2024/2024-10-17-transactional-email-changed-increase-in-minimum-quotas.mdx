We have updated the minimum email sending quotas to better align with your needs. You can view the new limits on the [Capabilities and Limits](
https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/managed-services/transactional-email/reference-content/tem-capabilities-and-limits/)  page. These changes offer greater flexibility and optimization for managing your email volume.
