Starting **November 26, 2024**, a rate limit of **20 DNS queries per second** per Function instance will be applied. This limit only applies to queries that require a full DNS resolution and is enforced independently for each Function instance.

This rate limit is set above typical usage levels, so most users should not experience any impact on their applications.
