On older Debian Buster images, the installed custom version of `cloud-init` may interfere with IPv6 connectivity when the Instance transitions to using routed IP. To avoid this, you should install a newer version of `cloud-init` before the migration to routed IP. This procedure also recovers connectivity for an Instance already using routed IP.

1. Install the new `debian-stable` PPA.
   The URL of the PPA may be configured to use the `noble` series. Replace `noble` with `bionic` in the URL.
   ```bash
   rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/scaleway-ubuntu-stable-bionic.list
   add-apt-repository ppa:scaleway/debian-staging
   nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/scaleway-ubuntu-debian-staging-noble.list
   ```
   In the file opened with `nano`, replace `noble` with `bionic`.
2. Install the new version of `scaleway-ecosystem` and `cloud-init`. It is important to clean the previous `cloud-init` data as the new version has a structure that may cause a failure at the next boot.
   ```bash
   apt update
   apt -y install scaleway-ecosystem cloud-init
   cloud-init clean
   ```
3. Reboot the Instance to apply the changes.
   ```bash
   reboot
   ```
