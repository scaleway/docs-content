## General information

### What are Elastic Metal servers?

An Elastic Metal server is a 100%-dedicated machine without a hypervisor, available in a cloud ecosystem.

With Elastic Metal, you get full control of the resources and applications installed on the server, for maximum performance and security.

Several operating systems are available for [automatic installation from the console](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/install-server/).

### What is the difference between an Elastic Metal server and a Dedibox dedicated server?

Dedibox is our historical dedicated server range, available only with monthly billing.

Elastic Metal is an improved and more flexible offer, giving all the same features with flexible hourly billing, cloud integration, and more.

### What are the differences between the available Elastic Metal server ranges?

We provide several ranges of Elastic Metal servers, each designed to meet the requirements of your different workloads:

  * **Aluminium**: Fully dedicated Elastic Metal servers with native cloud integration, at the best price.
  * **Beryllium**: Powerful, balanced, and reliable servers for production-grade applications.
  * **Lithium**: Designed with huge local storage to store, back up, and protect your data.
  * **Iridium**: Powerful dedicated servers designed to handle high-workload applications.

### Which regions and Availability Zones offer Elastic Metal servers?

Elastic Metal servers are available in the following regions and Availability Zones:

* Amsterdam, The Netherlands (`AMS-1` and `AMS-2`)
* Paris, France (`PAR-1` and `PAR-2`)
* Warsaw, Poland (`WAW-2` and `WAW-3`)

## Billing and pricing

### How am I billed for Elastic Metal servers?

You can choose hourly or monthly billing.
In both cases, you will receive an invoice at the end of each month corresponding to your resource consumption for that period, calculated based on the number of hours allocated to your account and your billing choice.

To benefit from more advantageous monthly pricing, you will pay a one-time commitment fee equivalent to one month of subscription. In addition, if you rent an Elastic Metal server for more than 12 months, you will be rewarded with Scaleway credits equivalent to your commitment fee.

### Which Elastic Metal billing option should I choose, hourly or monthly?

An hourly-billed dedicated server allows you to take advantage of both the flexibility of the public cloud and the power of a dedicated server. This can be ideal for use during periods of peak activity or one-off events.

If you need a powerful server on a frequent and continual basis, you may find that monthly billing is more suitable for you. In this case, you will get a more advantageous price, while still benefiting from full integration with our public cloud to manage sporadic exceptional workloads or peak periods.

<Message type="important">
  You must [create](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/create-server/) and [reinstall](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/reinstall-server/) a new Elastic Metal server to switch from monthly to hourly billing, and vice versa.
</Message>

### What is the loyalty reward and how do I use it?

The loyalty reward is a cloud service voucher in the sum of the commitment fees paid at the time of your Elastic Metal server purchase.

You are entitled to it if you have a monthly Elastic Metal server that is up and running for 12 consecutive months without termination. You have the right to one voucher per physical server, and it can be used for all Scaleway Cloud products, apart from Elastic Metal servers and their associated options.

The loyalty reward voucher is valid for six months and automatically added to your Scaleway account. [Learn more about how to get and use a loyalty reward](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/get-use-loyalty-reward/).

### Can I get a refund of the commitment fees after 12 months of keeping the server?

It is not possible to get a cash refund of the engagement fees.

### How much does a Windows Server license cost?

Windows Server 2019 or 2022 licenses are priced monthly (no prorating), based on:
- Number of physical CPUs,
- Number of cores per CPU,
- OS version: Standard or Datacenter.

<Message type="note">
  Licenses are billed per month, whether your Elastic Metal server itself is billed hourly or monthly.

## Technical questions

### How long does it take to boot an Elastic Metal server?

An Elastic Metal server is delivered to your account within a few minutes. You can then launch the server installation, which can take up to one hour.

### Which OSes can be installed on Elastic Metal servers?

We provide a range of Linux and Windows Server distributions for automatic installation from the Scaleway console.

### Can I adjust the bandwidth for my Elastic Metal Server?

Yes, you have the flexibility to modify the bandwidth available for your Elastic Metal server according to your requirements.
Each Elastic Metal dedicated server comes with an allocated bandwidth allowance. However, you can easily increase or decrease this bandwidth through your Scaleway console at any time.

Scaleway offers high-performance bandwidth options of up to 25Gbps per server, all of which include unlimited traffic.
For step-by-step instructions on how to modify the available bandwidth for your Elastic Metal server, refer to our documentation on [how to modify the available bandwidth for an Elastic Metal server](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/modify-available-bandwidth/).

<Message type="note">
  The maximum available bandwidth for each Elastic Metal server is determined by the physical conditions of the network card installed, as specified in the offer description.

### How can I reinstall an Elastic Metal server?

You can reinstall an Elastic Metal server with a few clicks at any time, [directly from your Scaleway console](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/install-server/).

### How do I back up an Elastic Metal server?

Elastic Metal servers must be backed up differently from Instances, which have the snapshot feature.

The first level is to back up your Elastic Metal server's data and configuration. This can be done by exporting it to an [Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/quickstart/). You can check our tutorial on [backing up servers to Object Storage](/tutorials/backup-dedicated-server-s3-duplicity/) for more information.

The security and redundancy of your data can also be ensured by a cluster configuration of your application.

If you need a backup system, you can refer to the documentation for your OS, such as the [information on snapshots](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lvm).

### Can I change the BIOS settings or update the firmware of an Elastic Metal server?

Users are not allowed to change the BIOS settings of Elastic Metal servers, as modifications may lead to system malfunction and data unavailability.

Firmware updates are managed by Scaleway. If your Elastic Metal server requires a firmware upgrade, it will be installed automatically upon reboot of the server.

### What happens to the data stored on the disks when I delete the server?

After deletion, all data present on the disks of an Elastic Metal server is wiped using a secure algorithm.

Make sure to back up your data before deleting a server, as it cannot be recovered once the disks are wiped.

### How many flexible IPs can I have per Elastic Metal server?

You can have up to 64 [flexible IPs](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/order-flexible-ip/) per Elastic Metal server.

### Can I move flexible IPs between my Elastic Metal servers and Instances?

It is not currently possible to move your flexible IPs between different products. Each set of flexible IPs you hold is independent and usable only with the specific product. An Instance's flexible IPs cannot be attached to an Elastic Metal server and vice versa.

### Can I have IPv6 connectivity for my Elastic Metal servers?

Yes, you can order flexible IPv6 for your Elastic Metal server. These can be attributed to any of your Elastic Metal servers in the same way as flexible IPv4s.

Each failover IP consists of a `/64` IPv6 subnet (18,446,744,073,709,551,616 IPv6s).

<Message type="note">
  When you configure the reverse DNS of a failover IPv6, the configuration is applied only to the first IP of each block (`XXXX:0`).
</Message>

### Do you provide an IPv6 address by default with Elastic Metal?

Yes, Elastic Metal servers are delivered with an IPv6 address (/128) preconfigured.

## Windows Server specific questions

### Is Windows available on Elastic Metal?

Yes. Monthly Windows licenses are available, in French only, for Elastic Metal servers.

You must order a server from the list of Elastic Metal servers compatible with Microsoft Windows Server. Then you can choose the version of Windows Server to install in one click from our console.


### Why are there different versions of Microsoft Windows Server?

Windows Server license comes in 2 versions, Standard and Datacenter, each at a different price. The availability of certain features, such as roles, depends on the version you choose.

You can find more information about the various features and limitations of each version on the [Microsoft website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/editions-comparison-windows-server-2019?tabs=full-comparison).


### Can I transfer the monthly license to another server?

Licenses delivered with an Elastic Metal server are only valid on Scaleway's Elastic Metal servers, and cannot be recovered for external use.

Each Windows installation implies the invoicing of a new license, except when reinstalling an Elastic Metal server where it was already previously installed.

### How can I install Hyper-V on Windows Server?

After installing the OS, you can manually enable Hyper-V roles from the Roles and Features Wizard.

### How many virtual machines can I install under Hyper-V?

Hyper-V is a hypervisor for hosting virtual machines. The Standard version of Microsoft Server allows you to install 2 virtual machines per host (per Elastic Metal server). The number of virtual machines (VM) on the Datacenter version is unlimited.
