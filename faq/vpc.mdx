## Private Networks

### What are Private Networks?

Private Networks are a managed cloud service allowing you to create layer 2 ethernet-switched domains. 
These domains can also be called a virtual LAN (VLAN). They are virtual but completely private local networks that securely connect your Scaleway resources together without necessarily exposing them publicly. Scaleway resources including Instances, Elastic Metal servers, Load Balancers and Databases are all compatible with Private Networks.

### Can I connect multiple Private Networks on the same Scaleway resource?

Yes, you can configure multiple Private Networks on the same Scaleway resource. For example, in the case of Instances, you can connect multiple Private Networks to the same Instance. A virtual network interface is created for each Private Network the Instance is attached to. You can then bring up each of them as indicated in our [documentation](/compute/instances/how-to/use-private-networks/#how-to-configure-the-private-network-interface-on-your-instances). For Elastic Metal, check out our documentation on [configuring the network interface](/compute/elastic-metal/how-to/use-private-networks/#how-to-configure-the-network-interface-on-your-elastic-metal-server-for-private-networks).

You can configure:
- Up to 8 Private Networks per Scaleway resource
- Up to 255 Private Networks per Organization
- Up to 255 Scaleway resources per Private Network

### Do I have to restart a Scaleway resource after adding Private Networks?

No, Private Network interfaces will appear on your resources without any reboot.

### Does Private Network support IPv6?

Yes, you can configure IPv6 within Private Networks. To use it, the netmask should always be `/64` and we recommend to use `fc00::/7` unique [local address (ULA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_local_address) range. ULA IPv6 address generators are widely available to generate a personalized range.

### Do resources in a Private Network require a public IPv4 address?

No, they do not require a public IPv4 address.

### Can resources in a Private Network access the Internet without a public IPv4 address?

Yes. You can attach a Public Gateway to your Private Network and enable NAT to provide Internet access to your Instances, Elastic Metal servers and other Scaleway resources.

### Do Non-IP protocols work Over Private Networks?

Technically, any ethernet payload should work over Private Networks. However, only IPv4 and IPv6 are officially supported. If you have real use cases for other protocols, let us know.

### Do Private Networks support IP auto-configuration?

Yes. You can attach a Public Gateway to your Private Network and enable DHCP to provide IP auto-configuration for your resources.

## Public Gateways

### What is a Public Gateway?

Public Gateways sit at the border of Private Networks. They provide services to automate the allocation of private IP addresses (DHCP) and deal with traffic entering and exiting the network (NAT).
A Public Gateway can be attached to up to 8 Private Networks and up to 50 Public Gateways are supported per Organization.

The Public Gateway can be configured through the console or the [API](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/vpc-gw/api/v1/).

### Does the Public Gateway require a public IPv4 address?

No. A public IPv4 address (aka. flexible IP) must be assigned to the Public Gateway at creation time, but you can detach it and delete it afterwards if you do not want to use the NAT feature.

### Do I have to restart resources after attaching a Public Gateway to my Private Network?

No. Resources in a Private Network for which autoconfiguration (DHCP) is enabled will automatically benefit from the services provided by the Public Gateway. 
Autoconfiguration is automatically enabled in recent Instances. If your Instance is too old, you may have to update it or enable autoconfiguration by hand. For more details about configuring Instances, see [here](/network/vpc/how-to/configure-instances-public-gw/#how-to-carry-out-manual-configuration).

### Can my Instances and other resources access the Internet without a public IPv4 address?

Yes. With NAT enabled, the Public Gateway shares its public IPv4 address (aka. flexible IP) with the Instances and other resources attached to the Private Network, so that they can access the Internet.
Moreover, the Public Gateway supports static NAT (aka. port forwarding), so that ingress traffic from the public Internet can reach Instances on the private network. This works by mapping pre-defined ports of the public IP address of the gateway to specific ports and IP addresses on the private network.

### Can I ping my Instances and other resources using their name?
Yes. The Public Gateway provides a local DNS service so that your Instances and other resources can resolve each otherâ€™s names into their IP address on the Private Network.
