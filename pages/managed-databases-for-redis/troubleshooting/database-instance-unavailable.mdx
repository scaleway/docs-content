## Problem

My Database Instance is unavailable.

## Possible causes

- High data loads
- High incoming traffic from specific apps or websites

## Solution

You can monitor your Database Instance activity to be able to quickly identify and act on irregular activities that might be causing the instability/unavailability.

[Monitor usage metrics on Cockpit](/managed-databases-for-redis/how-to/monitor-redis-databases-cockpit) to:

    - Check if the usage is regular. Database Instance can be impacted by high data loads or unexpected high traffic from an app or website, for example
    - Check the Database Instance logs for any unusual or suspicious activity
