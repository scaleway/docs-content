VPC allows you to build your own **V**irtual **P**rivate **C**loud on top of Scaleway's shared public cloud. Within each VPC, you can create multiple **Private Networks** and attach Scaleway resources to them, as long as the resources are in an AZ within the network's region. Attached resources can then communicate between themselves in an isolated and secure layer 2 network, away from the public internet.

Private Networks also have built-in **D**ynamic **H**ost **C**onfiguration **P**rotocol (DHCP), making it easy to manage the private IP addresses of your resources on the network.

Up to 512 resources can be attached to each Private Network, and each resource can be attached to up to eight Private Networks.

The following resource types can be attached to a Private Network:
- Instances
- Elastic Metal servers
- Load Balancers
- Public Gateways
- Managed Databases for PostgreSQL and MySQL

<Message type="note">
 Kubernetes Kapsules and Managed Databases for Redis™ are also compatible with Private Networks, but they can only be attached to a Private Network at the time of creating the resource. It is not possible to attach a cluster or Redis™ database to a Private Network after its creation, or change the attached Private Network.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created a Private Network](/network/vpc/how-to/create-private-network/)
  - You have created at least one Scaleway resource in the same region as your Private Network

## How to attach a resource to a Private Network

1. Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the side menu. Your VPC [dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/vpc/vpc) displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-default-vpc.webp" alt="" />

2. Click the VPC containing the Private Network to which you want to attach a resource. 

    A list of Private Networks in this VPC displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-pns.webp" alt="" />

3. Click the Private Network to which you want to attach a resource.

    The Private Network's dashboard displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-pn-overview.webp" alt="" />

4. Click the **Attached resources** tab.

    If you already have resources attached to the Private Network, a list of these displays. Otherwise, you see a welcome screen.

5. Click **+ Attach resource**. The following screen displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-attach-resource.webp" alt="" />

6. Select the type of resource (Instance, Elastic Metal server etc.) that you want to attach. Then select the specific resource to attach. Only resources within the same region (or one of its Availability Zones) as the Private Network will be displayed.

7. Click **Attach resource** to finish.

    You are returned to the list of attached resources, where the newly-attached resource now displays.

You can also attach a resource to a Private Network from the resource's own section of the console. Follow the relevant steps below:
- [Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/use-private-networks/#how-to-attach-instances-to-a-private-network)
- [Elastic Metal server](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/use-private-networks/#from-the-elastic-metal-section-of-the-console)
- [Managed Database for PostgreSQL and MySQL](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/connect-database-private-network/)
- [Load Balancer](/network/load-balancer/how-to/use-with-private-network/)
- [Public Gateway](/network/vpc/how-to/create-private-network/#how-to-attach-and-detach-resources-tofrom-a-private-network)

Note that for Kubernetes Kapsules and Managed Databases for Redis™, you can only attach the resource to a Private Network at the time of creating the resource itself.

## How to view the resource's IP address

When you attach a resource to a Private Network, it is automatically assigned an IPv4 and IPv6 address on that network. This is assigned from the CIDR block defined at the time of the Private Network's creation. 

The IP allocated when you attach the resource remains stable for as long as the resource is attached to the Private Network, and does not risk changing even across reboots and long poweroffs. The IP is lost only when you delete the resource or detach it from the Private Network.

You can view a resource's IPv4 or v6 address in the **Attached Resources** tab of the Private Network itself (follow steps 1 - 5 above)

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-attached-resources.webp" alt="" />

It can also be viewed via the **Private Networks** tab of the resource's own dashboard.

<Message type="tip">
Refer to our documentation on [IPv4](/network/vpc/how-to/create-private-network/#how-to-configure-cidr), [IPv6](/network/vpc/how-to/create-private-network/#ipv6) and [CIDR](/network/vpc/how-to/create-private-network/#ipv4) blocks for further information about these concepts.

<Message type="important">

When you attach an Instance or Elastic Metal server to a legacy Private Network on which you [have not activated DHCP](/network/vpc/reference-content/vpc-migration/#dhcp-activation-on-pre-existing-private-networks), no IP address is configured or shown on the screen shown above.<br /><br />

You will need to carry out manual configuration to set the IP address on the resource, or activate DHCP.<br /><br />

We strongly recommend that you [activate DHCP on the Private Network](/network/vpc/how-to/activate-dhcp/) to let us automatically handle IP address management. <br /> <br />

If you do not see an IP address in the screens above for your resource, and you think you should, check out our [troubleshooting](/network/vpc/troubleshooting/resource-attached-no-ip/) guide. <br /> <br />

Note that in any case, for Elastic Metal servers, some [manual configuration is required](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/use-private-networks/#how-to-configure-the-network-interface-on-your-elastic-metal-server-for-private-networks) even after activating DHCP. This is not required for Instances or other types of resources.

## How to detach a resource from a Private Network

1. Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the side menu.

2. Click the VPC containing the Private Network from which you want to detach a resource.

    A list of Private Networks in this VPC displays.

3. Click the Private Network from which you want to detach a resource.

4. Click the **Attached resources** tab.

    A list of resources attached to the Private Network displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-attached-resources.webp" alt="" />

5. Click the <Icon name="unlink" /> icon next to the resource you want to detach.

6. Click **Detach resource** when prompted to confirm.

You can also detach a resource to a Private Network from the resource's own section of the console.
