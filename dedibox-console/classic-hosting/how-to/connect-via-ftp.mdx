**F**ile **T**ransfer **P**rotocol (FTP) is a standard method for transferring files between a client (e.g., your local computer) and a server (e.g., your Scaleway web hosting server) via the internet. This guide shows you how to configure the popular and free FTP client [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) to connect to your web hosting site using FTP. You will then be able to transfer files from your local computer to your Scaleway web hosting server. For additional help, refer to the [FileZilla Client Tutorial](https://wiki.filezilla-project.org/FileZilla_Client_Tutorial_(en)).

In this example, we assume your domain name is `example.com` and your FTP account is `webmaster@example.com`. Ensure you have [created an FTP account](/dedibox-console/classic-hosting/how-to/create-ftp-account/) before proceeding.

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- A **Web Hosting Classic** plan and a domain name
- An [FTP account created](/dedibox-console/classic-hosting/how-to/create-ftp-account/)

### Installing FileZilla

1. Open the [FileZilla website](https://filezilla-project.org/) in your browser.
2. Click **Download FileZilla Client**.
    The FileZilla website detects your operating system and suggests the correct version of the FileZilla client to download.
3. Click **Download FileZilla Client** and follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation.
    <Message type="tip">
      Depending on your operating system, you may prefer to download FileZilla from the command line of your terminal. On Ubuntu Linux, use the command `sudo apt update && sudo apt install filezilla`.

### Configuring the FTP Account

2. Click on **File** in the top menu, and select **Site Manager**.
3. Enter the following information in the form that displays. Remember to replace the **User** and **Password** values with [those of your FTP account](/dedibox-console/classic-hosting/how-to/create-ftp-account/).

  You are now connected via FTP to your web hosting site. Remember that all files for your website must be stored in the `www` folder.

  Refer to the official [FileZilla documentation](https://wiki.filezilla-project.org/Documentation) for more help with using FileZilla to connect to your site and transfer files via FTP.
