There are different ways to deploy Serverless Functions and this document demonstrates and compares the most popular ways and tools to do it.

## Scaleway console

The [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com/) is a ready-to-go tool to deploy your functions, it is useful to write down code out of the box quicky.

Everything is included: logs, metrics, all settings, etc... it works well with single-file projects as the editor is limited.

Deploying larger projects with dependencies and many files requires you to zip your code before uploading it, we have a tutorial here for 
[packaging functions in a zip file](/serverless/functions/how-to/package-function-dependencies-in-zip/).

## Serverless framework

Serverless Framework is a dedicated tool to deploy Serverless Functions and Containers.

It makes it really simple with minimum effort to deploy your code with a single command `serverless deploy`.
Functions configuration is done in a single file and it's easy to track in version control systems.

Install, examples, usage and advanced documentation is avaiable in the [Serverless Scaleway Plugin repository](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-scaleway-functions).

Serverless Framework can be used in many use cases such as CI/CD, production deployment, 
multiple project deployments with [serverless-compose](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/compose).

## Terraform

Serverless Functions integrates easily with your infrastrucure as code, we provide a
[Terraform integration for Functions](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/scaleway/scaleway/latest/docs/resources/function).

For detailed usage you can have a look at our Terraform example using TF
with python [terraform-python-example](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-examples/tree/main/functions/terraform-python-example).

## API-Framework (Python)

Writing parts of your API fully in Python is possible with the [serverless-api-project](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-api-project).

It integrates perfectly with Python code bases where you just need to import the package to 
expose your handlers directly in the cloud.

## Locally

In order to develop and test your function locally before deploying them we provide frameworks to test your code:
- [Go Framework](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-functions-go)
- [Python Framework](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-functions-python)

## API

[Scaleway HTTP API](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/functions/api/) allows managing Serverless Functions and Containers
with HTTP calls.

API function management can be useful for integration in automated tasks, continuous integrations and limited environments.

Deploying a function requires multiple calls: Namespace creation, function creation, generating URL to push code, running function deployment.

## CLI

[Scaleway CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli) is a simple command line interface tool that allows you to drive your Serverless
Functions and Containers.

Install instructions and documentation is available on the [Scaleway CLI repository](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli).

Here are some calls to deploy a function:

```sh
scw function namespace create name=hello
# saving my namespace ID for later use
scw function function create name=myfunc runtime=go120 namespace-id=<MY-NAMESPACE-ID>
```

## Scaleway SDKs

Scaleway SDKs allow you to manage your resources directly from your favorite languages.

Here are our available SDKs:

- [Go SDK](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-sdk-go)
- [JS SDK](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-sdk-js)
- [Python SDK](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-sdk-python)

SDKs documentation is directly in the repositories.
