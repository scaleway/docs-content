    </Message>
4.  Copy the token displayed and create a `TXT` record with the name `_scaleway-challenge` within your current DNS zone as instructed:
    <Lightbox src="assets/scaleway-dns-validation-token.webp" alt="" />
    <Message type="important">
      The token's presence will be checked regularly. If it has not been set within 48 hours, the external domain will be deleted from the service.
    </Message>

The status of any ongoing DNS challenges is visible through blue dot on the left-side of the domain name:
<Lightbox src="assets/scaleway-dns-ongoing-validation.webp" alt="" />
Once the record has been validated, the dot turns green and you will receive an e-mail with further instructions on how to update your domain's DNS servers.

Update the nameserver information at your current registrar once the domain name is validated in order to link your existing domain name with your Scaleway Domains DNS zone. 
<Message type="note">
  Scaleway's DNS servers are:
  * ns0.dom.scw.cloud
  * ns1.dom.scw.cloud
</Message>

You can verify whether the association of your domain has been successfully completed by checking the Nameservers list in the **Domain Information** page. 

<Message type="important">
  If the entire process is not completed after 14 days, the domains are deleted from the DNS and you will have to start over. E-mails reminding you to complete the process are sent on days 7 and 13.
