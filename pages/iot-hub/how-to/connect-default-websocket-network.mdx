import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'


Each Hub automatically creates a default WebSocket network, and, like the default network, users cannot delete it.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created an IoT Hub](/iot-hub/how-to/create-hub/)

1. [Add a Hub device](/iot-hub/how-to/add-device/) if you haven't already done so.

    As the WebSocket network does not implement Mutual TLS authentication, choose to `Allow Insecure` connections.
2. Configure the physical device (or client) to connect through the network, using the following parameters:
    - **Host**: The network endpoint.
    - **Port**: Use `80` for plaintext or `443` for TLS.
    - **MQTT Username**: The *Device ID* from the device you created earlier.
    - If your client asks for a password, pass in an empty string.

    <Message type="important">
      Mutual TLS authentication is not available on this network, which means that devices that connect over this network must `Allow Insecure` connections.
    </Message>
3. Connect and exchange messages.
