## Socket.io Overview

Socket.io enables real-time event-based communication between one or more clients and a server. It works on every platform, browser or device and is fast and reliable. Socket.io has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for Node.js. Both components have an identical API.

In this tutorial, we will cover setting up a basic Express.js application with Socket.io. We will create a simple chat server and show the basics of how a client and server work together.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have an Ubuntu Xenial server
- You have [configured your SSH Key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- You have root access to all of the servers you want to manage

</Message>

Before we begin, we assume that you have Node.js and NPM (Node Package Manager) installed. If not, we highly recommend downloading and installing NVM. NVM is a version manager for node.

Confirm that both tools are installed on your system by typing:

```
root@socket:~# node --version
v4.2.6
root@socket:~# npm --version
3.5.2
```

### Installing Express.js and Socket.io

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.

1. Create a folder that we will call `myapp`

  ```
  mkdir myapp
  cd myapp
  ```

2. Use npm init to create a package.json

  ```
  npm init
  ```

  The npm init command will create an empty project with a package.json file. You can answer all the questions or press enter through all of them if you do not want to.

3. Install Express and Socket.io and save them to our package.json file for later

  ```
  npm install socket.io express --save
  ```

4. Install jquery

  ```
  npm install jquery --save
  ```

### Creating an Express server

Let's begin by creating an express server that displays _Hello World_.

1. Create a new file in the socket-app folder.

  ```
  mkdir app.js
  ```

2. In the new file called `app.js`, paste the following content

  ```js
  // app.js
  var express = require('express');
  var app = express();
  var server = require('http').createServer(app);
  var io = require('socket.io')(server);

  app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/node_modules'));
  app.get('/', function(req, res,next) {
      res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html');
  });

  server.listen(4200);
  ```

  In the `app.js` file above, we are requiring Express, and creating a new server. We are then requiring Socket.io.

  We are setting the static folder to `/node_modules` since we are using npm to server up jQuery and we want to be able to reference it in our html.

  App.get routes HTTP requests to the specified path with a specific call back function. The `res` object represents the HTTP response that an Express app sends when it gets a request. The `sendFile` just sends the file at the specific path. The `server.listen` will open a port and listen for requests coming in.

3. Create an index.html file which will display a `Hello World` message

  ```html
  <!doctype html>
  <html lang="en">
      <head>

      </head>
      <body>
          <h1>Hello World!</h1>
          <div id="future"></div>
          <form id="form" id="chat_form">
              <input id="chat_input" type="text">
              <input type="submit" value="Send">
          </form>
          <script src="/jquery/dist/jquery.js"></script>
          <script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
      </body>
  </html>
  ```

  As you can see from the bottom the script src are pointing to files in our `node_modules` folder.

4. Launch the server to make sure everything works

  ```
  node app.js
  ```

5. Open up a browser at `http://Server_IP:4200`. It should display the following:

<Lightbox src="scaleway-Hello_world.png" alt="" />

### Connecting a Client to the Server using Socket.io

Let's try to get the client to connect to the server with Socket.io and have it respond in the console.

1. In the `app.js` file, edit the `index.html` to add this script to the bottom of the file

  ```html
  <!--Index.html-->
  ...
  <script>
  var socket = io.connect('http://10.1.220.19:4200');
  socket.on('connect', function(data) {
      socket.emit('join', 'Hello World from client');
  });
  </script>
  ```

  The `socket.on('connect')` is an event which is fired upon a successful connection from the web browser. We then have a function callback that will send the hello world message to the server.

2. Edit the `app.js` file to add just before the `server.listen` the following configuration. We've pasted the `server.listen` again in the example below as you should not forget closing parenthesis.

  ```js
  // app.js

  io.on('connection', function(client) {
      console.log('Client connected...');
      client.on('join', function(data) {
        console.log(data);
      });
  });

  server.listen(4200);
  ```

  The `io.on` is listening for connections. When it receives one it will report to the console `client connected...`. The `'client.on('join')` will wait for a message from the client for `join`. It will then log it to the console.

3. Launch the node again.

  ```
  node app.js
  ```

<Lightbox src="sccaleway-ClientConnected.png" alt="" />

### Setting up the Socket server

<Message type="important">

The following section can only work if your server is setup locally.

</Message>

We need to configure the server so it replies to the client with a message.

1. Add the `emit` line after console.log.

  ```js
  // app.js
  io.on('connection', function(client) {
      console.log('Client connected...');
      client.on('join', function(data) {
        console.log(data);
        client.emit('messages', 'Hello from server');
      });
  });

  server.listen(4200);
  ```

  The client.emit will send a message back to the client that just connected with a message using 'messages'.

2. Add a new `socket.on` messages event in the `index.html`.

  ```js
  // index.html
          socket.on('messages', function(data) {
                  alert(data);
          });
  ```

  Now when a client connects, it will send a message to the server and it will trigger a popup.

### Excluding the Socket server

In the previous examples we saw that we can send a message to the server and that we can also send a message back to the client. Now, if we need to send a message to all the clients excluding the socket that started it, it is also possible.

1. Update the `index.html`

```html
<script>
var socket = io.connect('http://51.15.244.129:4200');
socket.on('connect', function(data) {
socket.emit('join', 'Hello World from client');
});
socket.on('broad', function(data) {
    $('#future').append(data+ "<br/>");
});

$('form').submit(function(e){
e.preventDefault();
var message = $('#chat_input').val();
socket.emit('messages', message);
});

</script>
```

  We added in a new `JQuery .submit` event handler which prevents the form from submitting and instead send a message to the server with the values of the input field in messages.

  Also, we added a new socket event listener for 'broad' which updates our div with the message that was returned.

2. Update the `app.js`

  ```js
  // app.js
  ...
  io.on('connection', function(client) {
      console.log('Client connected...');
      client.on('join', function(data) {
          console.log(data);
          client.on('messages', function(data) {
              client.emit('broad', data);
              client.broadcast.emit('broad',data);
          });
      });
  });
  server.listen(4200);
  ```

  You can see we are listening on messages. After receiving data we simply inform all other clients, including the socket that sent the message, the data.

  If we restart the app.js file we will see we can now send messages to all other clients when we type anything into our input box and press submit. The div under the hello world message should update.
