## What is IPAM?

**IP** **A**ddress **M**anager (IPAM) is Scaleway's tool for planning, tracking, and managing the IP address space of Scaleway products. It acts as a single source of truth for the IP addresses of Scaleway resources, and has a number of associated functionalities to help manage your Scaleway IPs.

## What can I do with IPAM?

IPAM is currently in [public beta](https://www.scaleway.com/en/betas/), and rollout of IPAM functionality is being done gradually. For now, the following features are available:

- In the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/ipam/), you can currently use IPAM to view, tag and filter all your [private IP addresses](#private-ip-address)
- With the [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/ipam/), you can additionally [reserve](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/ipam/#path-ips-book-a-new-ip) an available IP from a Private Network's CIDR block, or [release](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/ipam/#path-ips-release-an-ip) a previously-reserved address that you no longer want.

More functionality is planned for the future, including:

- Reserve/release private IP addresses in the console
- Select a reserved private IP address to use when attaching a resource to a Private Network
- Management of public IP addresses
