GlusterFS is an open-source, scalable network filesystem suited for high data-intensive workloads, such as media streaming, cloud storage, and content delivery networks (CDN). 
In this tutorial, we will deploy a high-availability storage solution using **GlusterFS 11** and **Scaleway Block Storage** on **Ubuntu 22.04**.

Each storage Instance will mirror the other, and files will automatically be replicated across all servers.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- Three Instances running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Attached [Scaleway Block Storage](/storage/block/how-to/attach-a-volume/) to each GlusterFS Instance

## Configuring the host file

Before installing GlusterFS, ensure each Instance can resolve the others via their hostname. This will simplify network communication between servers.

1. Log in to each Instance via SSH.
    ```
    ssh root@<your_instance_public_ip>
    ```
2. Update the system:
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```

3. Edit the `/etc/hosts` file on each Instance:
    ```
    nano /etc/hosts
    ```

4. Add entries for each Instance:
    ```
    <IP_ADDRESS_1> gluster01
    <IP_ADDRESS_2> gluster02
    <IP_ADDRESS_3> client01
    ```

5. Verify hostname resolution:
    ```
    ping -c 3 gluster01
    ping -c 3 gluster02
    ping -c 3 client01
    ```

## Adding the GlusterFS 11 repository

1. Install the `software-properties-common` package on all Instances:
    ```
    apt install software-properties-common -y
    ```

2. Add the GlusterFS 11 repository to all systems:
    ```
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gluster/glusterfs-11
    apt update
    ```

---

## Installing GlusterFS server

1. Install the GlusterFS server on both `gluster01` and `gluster02`:
    ```
    apt install glusterfs-server -y
    ```

2. Start the `glusterd` service and enable it at boot:
    ```
    systemctl start glusterd.service
    systemctl enable glusterd.service
    ```

3. Verify the installation:
    ```
    systemctl status glusterd.service
    glusterfs --version
    ```

    You should see GlusterFS 11.x and an active status for the service.

## Setting Up a distributed GlusterFS volume with Scaleway Block Storage

<Message type="important">
    In a production environment, it is **strongly recommended** to use dedicated storage, such as **Scaleway Block Storage**, instead of system directories for GlusterFS volumes.
    This ensures better data safety, scalability, and performance. Using system directories (like `/glusterfs`) can lead to potential issues if the root partition fills up.
</Message>

### Attaching Scaleway Block Storage

1. Create and attach Scaleway Block Storage to each Instance:
   - From the Scaleway Console, [create a new Block Storage volume](/storage/block/how-to/create-a-volume/) for each GlusterFS server.
   - Attach each volume to the respective Instance.
   - Once attached, log into each Instance and check if the block storage is recognized:
     ```
     lsblk
     ```
     You should see a new unmounted device (e.g., `/dev/sdb`).

2. Partition the volume and format it with a filesystem (e.g., `ext4`):
     ```
     mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb
     ```

3. Mount the Block Storage to a directory:
   - Create a mount point for GlusterFS:
     ```
     mkdir -p /mnt/glusterfs
     ```
   - Mount the volume to the directory:
     ```
     mount /dev/sdb /mnt/glusterfs
     ```

4. Add the Block Storage to `/etc/fstab` to ensure it mounts automatically after reboot:
     ```
     /dev/sdb /mnt/glusterfs ext4 defaults 0 0
     ```

5. Repeat these steps and attach, format, and mount a Block Storage volume on all GlusterFS Instances (e.g., `gluster01` and `gluster02`).

### Creating a distributed GlusterFS volume

Now that Block Storage is mounted on both servers, proceed with creating the distributed GlusterFS volume:

1. Create a GlusterFS Volume using the mounted block storage directories on both servers. Run the following command on `gluster01`:
   ```
   gluster volume create vol01 transport tcp gluster01:/mnt/glusterfs gluster02:/mnt/glusterfs force
   ```

2. Start the volume:
   ```
   gluster volume start vol01
   ```

3. Check the volume status:
   ```
   gluster volume info
   ```

## Configuring the GlusterFS client

1. Install the GlusterFS client on `client01`:
    ```
    apt install glusterfs-client -y
    ```

2. Create a mount point:
    ```
    mkdir -p /mnt/glusterfs
    ```

3. Mount the GlusterFS volume:
    ```
    mount -t glusterfs gluster01:/vol01 /mnt/glusterfs
    ```

4. Verify the mount:
    ```
    df -h /mnt/glusterfs
    ```

5. Add the volume to `/etc/fstab` for permanent mounting:
    ```
    gluster01:/vol01 /mnt/glusterfs glusterfs defaults,_netdev 0 0
    ```

## Testing replication and mirroring

1. Mount the GlusterFS volume on both `gluster01` and `gluster02`:
    ```
    mount -t glusterfs gluster01:/vol01 /mnt
    mount -t glusterfs gluster02:/vol01 /mnt
    ```

2. From `client01`, create test files in `/mnt/glusterfs`:
    ```
    touch file01 file02 file03
    ```

3. Verify that the files are replicated on both `gluster01` and `gluster02`:
    ```
    ls /mnt
    ```

You should see the same files on both servers, confirming the replication is working.
