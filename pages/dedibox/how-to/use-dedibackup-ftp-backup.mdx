Dedibackup is a remote storage solution available for all Dedibox dedicated servers.

Two options are available:

*  A storage capacity of **100 GB** (included in the offer, without additional costs),
*  A storage capacity of **750 GB** (as option).

The storage system is backed by our [Object Storage](https://www.scaleway.com/en/object-storage/) solution in the PAR-1 region.

<Message type="note">
  Each offer allows you to store up to 1000 (one thousand) files on your Dedibackup volume. We recommend using archives (tarballs/zip) for your backups.

## How to access the backup space

You can access your backup space after its activation using the FTP protocol.


### FTP parameters

| Name of the server | dedibackup-dcX.online.net              |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Port               | 21                                     |
| Login              | sd-serverid (ex. sd-1234)              |
| Password           | the password you set during activation |

<Message type="note">
Replace `dcX` in the Dedibackup hostname with the location of your Dedibackup account.

You can find the hostname for your Dedibackup space in the **Backup** section of the server's console.

Available locations are:
- `dedibackup-dc2.online.net`
- `dedibackup-dc3.online.net`
</Message>

You are not limited in number of simultaneous connections. The use of FTPFS is not allowed.

<Message type="important">
  You cannot upload from an IP outside the Dedibox network.
</Message>

### Technical specifications

The following FTP commands are allowed:

```
ABOR, ACCT, APPE, CDUP, CWD, DELE, FEAT, LIST, MDTM, MKD, MODE, NLIST, NOOP, PASS, PASV, PORT, PWD, QUIT, RETR (only with argument), REST, RNFR, RNTO, RMD, SITE, SIZE, SMNT, STAT, STOR, SYST, TYPE, USER, XCUP, XCWD, XMKD, XPWD, XRMD.
```

### Security

*  **Autologin**: If you activate this function, you can log into your account without a password (automatic authentication based on your IP address and MAC address). With this feature, you can avoid transmitting your login information unencrypted over the network. Once this feature has been activated in your account, use the username `auto` and an empty password to connect.

#### How to enable autologin

1. Access your [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net/en/login).
2. Click **Server** in the menu on the top of the page, then click **Server list**. A list of your Dedibox servers displays.
3. Click **Manage** next to the server you want to configure. The server overview displays.
4. Click **Backup** in the side menu. The backup management page displays.
5. Click **Edit connection settings** 
6. Tick the box **Auto-login** and click **Update** to validate.

<Message type="tip">
  All connection attempts (successful or unsuccessful) are stored in your Dedibox console in real-time.
</Message>

### Error messages

*  **500 Not accepted**: Problem while establishing the DATA connection. Verify your firewall configuration and try to use passive mode.
*  **502 Command not implemented**: The used command is not implemented on our servers. This causes disconnection from the server.
*  **500 Service Dedibackup temporary unavailable, try again later**: The backup system is currently not available or locked for maintenance.
*  **500 Impossible to get the IP, try again later**: Contact the support. An internal verification routine of your account has blocked your account.
*  **500 Your account is currently in maintenance, try again later**: Your account is in maintenance. It is recommended to retry to connect after 15 minutes.
*  **500 Communication error, try again later**: Internal malfunction, contact technical assistance if the problem persists.
*  **500 Communication error at the identification, try again later**: Internal malfunction with the authentication server, contact technical assistance if the problem persists.
*  **421 Configuration problem, try again later**: The configuration of your account is incorrect. Verify the configuration of your account in the management panel, contact technical assistance if the problem persists.
*  **553 Upload forbidden from an IP address external of the Dedibox network**: Using the STOR command is not allowed outside the Dedibox network.
*  **Too many files: [....] won't be saved, make tarballs.**: The limit of 1000 files on your Dedibackup account was bypassed. It will not be possible to add new files before deleting old ones.

In case of a failure during authentication (wrong identifier and/or password), connection failure of the access control list (ACL), or failure of the automatic login from an unauthorized IP, the connection will be systematically terminated with the message **421 Service not available**.


### Usage on Linux

To connect to the Dedibackup service, we recommend `lftp` for interactive use and `curl` for automated tasks:

#### Recommended tools
  * For interactive connections: Use `lftp`, which offers an interface and flexibility suitable for FTP sessions.
  * For automated scripts: Use `curl` for automation, though some limitations exist with FTP servers that do not support all commands.

#### Example of interactive connection with lftp

For interactive sessions, use `lftp` with the following command:
```bash
apt install lftp  # Requirement

FTP_HOST="ftp://dedibackup-dc3.online.net"
FTP_USER="sd-XXXXX"  # Replace with your server ID or 'auto' for autologin
FTP_PASS="your_password"  # Leave blank if using autologin

# - Connect to FTP server
# - Upload a file, list files, remove a file
# - Disconnect from FTP server
lftp -u "$FTP_USER,$FTP_PASS" "$FTP_HOST" <<EOF
# Change to the specified FTP directory
cd "/"
# Upload a file
put "path_to_your_file.7z"
# List files in the folder
ls
# Remove a file
rm "file_to_remove.7z"
bye
EOF
```
<Message type="note">
  Passive mode in `lftp` is automatically managed, so manual configuration is usually unnecessary.
</Message>

#### Example of automated connection with curl
When automating tasks, you can use `curl`, though command limitations may apply:

```bash
# Upload a file
curl -T "path_to_your_file.7z" -u "sd-XXXXX:your_password" ftp://dedibackup-dc3.online.net/
```
<Message type="tip">
  Replace `dedibackup-dc3` with the actual backup location (`-dc2`, `-dc3`, etc.), as specified in your Dedibox console.
</Message>

<Message type="note">
  Since curl version 7.74.0 the default behavior is to not get a new IP from the server for the passive connection.
  You have to use --no-ftp-skip-pasv-ip for curl to make the passive connection required.
