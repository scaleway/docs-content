Emails transfer allow you to forward the incoming mail of an existing email account to another address of your choice. 

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net)
  - You have created a **Webhosting Classic**
</Message>

<Message type="note">
  - In some cases, the forwarded mails are considered as SPAMs and are not properly received.
  - In this situation, we invite you to import the mails received at your existing email address from your other mail provider, instead of forwarding them.
</Message>

1. Click **Hosting**, then click **Manage** next to your webhosting. 
2. Scroll down to **E-mail accounts**, then click **E-mail forwarding**.
