WordPress is a popular, free and open source blogging tool and a content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MariaDB.

Working with the WordPress InstantApp significantly saves you time and effort as WordPress is already installed and configured on your Instance.

The new WordPress image is updated on a regular basis to be as close as possible to the latest release.

## Auto-install functionality

The WordPress image comes with a new `auto-install` functionality which allows you to create a WordPress Instance using a few well-defined tags.
Tags allow you to provide the basic information necessary to have a fully working WordPress Instance.

To trigger the auto-install functionality, two mandatory tags are required for full automation:

- `admin_user_name`
- `admin_email`


Optional tags such as `weblog_title`and `language` can also be used to add more customization to the Weblog.

<Message type="note">
  The value for the `language` tag must adhere to the [list of WordPress locale codes](https://wpastra.com/docs/complete-list-wordpress-locale-codes).

A random password will be generated and will be accessible when you log into your Instance with your SSH key.

## Creating WordPress Instances with the Scaleway CLI


### Creating a new WordPress Instance ready for installation


1. Open a terminal and type the following command to create a WordPress Instance:
    ```
    scw instance server create type=PLAY2-NANO zone=fr-par-2 image=wordpress root-volume=b:20G name=wordpress-instance ip=new
    ```

    You have created an Instance and an image called "WordPress". The Instance information, such as the IP address, displays in the output of the comment.

2. Open a web browser and paste your Instance's IP address
3. Complete the installation of your WordPress blog.


### Creating a new WordPress Instance with minimal configuration


1. Type the following command into your terminal to create a new WordPress Instance with the two mandatory tags allowing you to trigger `auto-install`:
    ```
    scw instance server create name=wordpress-instance type=PLAY2-NANO zone=fr-par-2 image=wordpress root-volume=b:20G ip=new tags.0="admin_user_name=myuser" tags.1="admin_email=me@example.com"
    ```
2. Run the following command into your terminal to log in to your Instance. Make sure you replace `<Instance Public IP>` with your Instance's public IP address.

    ```
    ssh root@<Instance Public IP>
    ```
    The following output displays when you log into your Instance:
    ```
