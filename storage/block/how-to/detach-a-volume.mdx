You can detach a Block Storage volume from your Instance at any time. It is important to [unmount the volume](/storage/block/api-cli/unmounting-a-volume/) from the operating system before detaching it to avoid data loss.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner/) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission/) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created a [Block Storage volume](/storage/block/how-to/create-a-volume/) that is [attached](/storage/block/how-to/attach-a-volume/) to an Instance


1. Click **Block Storage** in the **Storage** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The Block Storage page displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Detach from Instance** next to the volume of your choice. A pop-up displays.
3. Click **Detach volume from Instance** to confirm.
