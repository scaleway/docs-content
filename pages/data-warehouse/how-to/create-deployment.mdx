A Data Warehouse is a centralized repository designed to store, manage, and analyze large volumes of structured and semi-structured data. When powered by ClickHouse®, it provides performance for real-time analytics and complex queries. This guide will walk you through the steps to deploy a Data Warehouse for ClickHouse® deployment using the Scaleway console.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
