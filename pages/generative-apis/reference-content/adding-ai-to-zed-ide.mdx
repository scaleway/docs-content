Zed is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) including AI coding assistance support. Scaleway's Generative APIs support Zed AI code completion and more.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) for API authentication
- Installed [Zed](https://zed.dev/) on your local machine

### Configure custom endpoints and models

1. Edit Zed settings located in `settings.json`, and add the following content to it:
    ```json
    {
    "language_models": {
        "openai": {
        "api_url": "https://api.scaleway.ai/v1",
        "available_models": [
            {
            "name": "qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct",
            "display_name": "Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B",
            "max_tokens": 128000
            }
        ],
        "version": "1"
        }
    },
    "assistant": {
        "default_model": {
        "provider": "openai",
        "model": "qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct"
        },
        "version": "2"
    }
    }
    ```

    This configuration will add a `qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct` Scaleway hosted model available with the Zed `openai` provider, and use it as default model.

2. Open AI Assistant configuration by either using the command palette and typing `assistant: show configuration` or clicking on the bottom right **Assistant Panel** button and then **Assistant menu** in top right and finally **Configure**.

3. Scroll down to the OpenAI configuration, and paste your Scaleway secret key as API Key credentials.
    <Message type="note">
      Your key will be deleted if you restart Zed. To store it permanently, you can set up your Scaleway secret key as `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable and restart Zed.
    </Message>

4. Your setup is complete. If you open a new chat and select `Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B` model, you can send text and retrieve model answers. Additionally, you can use [Inline Assist](https://zed.dev/docs/assistant/inline-assistant#:~:text=You%20can%20use%20ctrl%2Denter,even%20within%20the%20terminal%20panel.) feature when editing your code.
