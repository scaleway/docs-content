## What is the difference between VPC and a Private Network?

One default VPC (**V**irtual **P**rivate **C**loud) for every available region is automatically created in each Scaleway [Project](/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project). A VPC offers layer 3 network isolation.

Within each VPC, you can create multiple **Private Networks** and attach Scaleway resources to them, as long as the resources are in an AZ within the network's region. Attached resources can then communicate between themselves in an isolated and secure layer 2 network, away from the public internet.

In the future, VPC will allow you to interconnect your VPC with other networks, define access control lists and more.

## Can I route traffic between different Private Networks on the same VPC?

Yes, [VPC routing](/vpc/concepts#routing) allows you to automize the routing of traffic between resources in different Private Networks within the same VPC.

## Can I route traffic between different Private Networks in different VPCs or different Scaleway Projects?

This is not currently possible. You may consider using a VPN tunnel to achieve this, for example [IPsec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec) or [WireGuard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WireGuard). Scaleway also offers an [OpenVPN InstantApp](/tutorials/openvpn-instant-app/), making it easy to install a VPN directly on an Instance.

## What happened to my classic, mono-AZ Private Network?

When VPC and regional Private Networks moved from Public Beta to General Availability, all mono-AZ Private Networks were automatically migrated to be regional. [Read the documentation](/vpc/reference-content/vpc-migration/) to find out more about the migration process.

## Do resources' IP addresses on a Private Network risk changing when allocated by managed DHCP?

With managed DHCP, the IP is allocated when the resource is attached to a Private Network, and released only when the resource is detached or deleted. The IP address remains stable across reboots and long power offs, and will not change except upon deletion or detachment from the Private Network.

Nonetheless, you can also reserve specific IPs from a Private Network's CIDR block, and use these IPs to attach specific resources, if you prefer. See our documentation on [how to reserve IPs](/ipam/how-to/reserve-ip/).

## How can I manage IP addresses for my Proxmox Virtual Machines (VMs) on Elastic Metal servers?

For this purpose use the option of attaching a **custom resource** to a Private Network, specifying its MAC address. Full instructions for attaching custom resources are in the [Private Networks documentation](/vpc/how-to/attach-resources-to-pn#how-can-i-manage-ip-addresses-for-my-proxmox-virtual-machines-vms-on-elastic-metal-servers).

You can also [reserve a private IP address](/ipam/how-to/reserve-ip/) with IPAM, and use this reserved address to attach a custom resource.
