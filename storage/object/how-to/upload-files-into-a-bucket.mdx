This page explains how to upload files into an Object Storage bucket using the [Scaleway console](https://consol.scaleway.com/). To upload an object using the S3 API, refer to the [dedicated documentation](/storage/object/api-cli/object-operations/#putobject).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. A list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the bucket name into which you want to upload your file.
3. Click the **upload** button, then select the files you want to upload into the bucket. Alternatively, you can drag and drop your files into the uploading area.

      Before uploading your files, make sure the file name is in accordance with the [AWS S3 Object key naming guidelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMetadata.html#object-key-guidelines/).

4. Select the [storage class](/storage/object/concepts/#storage-class) of your object. Scaleway Object Storage allows you to associate storage classes with each of your objects.
    <Message type="important">
      Do not close your web browser during an upload, as it can result in an incomplete upload. If you want to upload files larger than 1 GB, we recommend [using the CLI](/storage/object/api-cli/object-operations/#putobject).

    When the upload is completed, a list of the objects displays, including the newly uploaded objects.
