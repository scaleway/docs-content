## What is Scaleway's Cockpit?

Scaleway's Cockpit is a monitoring and alerting solution designed for multi-source observability. Cockpit allows you to collect, store, and analyze metrics and logs from your infrastructure and applications, giving you insights into your system's performance and behavior.

## How does Cockpit integrate with other Scaleway products?

Cockpit integrates seamlessly with Scaleway’s ecosystem. It provides pre-built dashboards and alerts to monitor other Scaleway products' performance.

## How am I billed for using Cockpit with my Scaleway data?

Scaleway’s monitoring is included for free for a period of 30 days for metrics and 7 days for logs.

Extended storage is available for €29 per month and entails 12 months of storage for metrics and 1 month of storage for logs.

Pricing plans are scoped per [Project](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project).

## How am I billed for using Cockpit with external data?

Cockpit’s pricing is based on two dimensions: the volume of external logs and metrics ingested and the duration of storage.

Metrics are billed €0.15 per million of samples ingested.
Logs are billed €0.35 per GB ingested.
Traces are free of charge during the public beta. Traces data is retained for 14 days. After this period, data older than 14 days is deleted.
You will not be charged for querying external data and the monitoring of your Scaleway resources is included for free for a period of 30 days.

## How do I send my own data to my Cockpit?

If you have set up an agent, you can send your data using our [dedicated documentation](/observability/cockpit/how-to/send-metrics-logs-to-cockpit/).
If you have not set up any agent, check out our [documentation to find out how to configure the Grafana agent, push your data, and visualize it in Grafana](/observability/cockpit/api-cli/configuring-grafana-agent/).

<Message type="important">
 Sending metrics and logs for Scaleway resources or personal data using an external path is a billable feature. In addition, any data that you push yourself is billed, even if you send data from Scaleway products. Refer to the [product pricing](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/?tags=available,managedservices-observability-cockpit) for more information.

## Will my dashboards be impacted by the Cockpit regionalization?

Soon, a new version of Cockpit will be released. In this version, the concept of **regionalization** will be introduced to offer you more flexibility and resilience for a seamless monitoring. 

If you have created customized dashboards with data for your Scaleway resources before April 2024, you will need to update your queries in Grafana, with the new regionalized data sources.
