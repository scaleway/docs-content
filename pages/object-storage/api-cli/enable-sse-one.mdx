<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Object Storage bucket](/object-storage/how-to/create-a-bucket/)
- Installed and initialized the [AWS CLI](/object-storage/api-cli/object-storage-aws-cli/)

## Enabling SSE-ONE on an existing bucket

You can enable SSE-ONE on existing buckets. Objects uploaded **after** enabling SSE-ONE are automatically encrypted. However, objects existing in the bucket before enabling SSE-ONE will not be encrypted, as encryption occurs during object upload.

1. In a terminal, run the command below to enable SSE-ONE on the target bucket. Make sure to replace `<your-bucket-name>` with the correct value. 

    ```bash
    aws s3api put-bucket-encryption \
    --bucket <your-bucket-name> \
    --server-side-encryption-configuration '{
        "Rules": [
            {
                "ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault": {
                    "SSEAlgorithm": "AES256"
                }
            }
        ]
      }'
    ```

2. run the command below to make sure the encryption was properly applied. Make sure to replace `<your-bucket-name>` with the correct value. 

    ```bash
    aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket <your-bucket-name>
    ```

    An output similar to the following displays:

    ```json
    {
      "ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration": {
        "Rules": [
          {
            "ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault": {
              "SSEAlgorithm": "AES256"
            },
            "BucketKeyEnabled": false
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

SSE-ONE is enabled on your bucket. Each object uploaded from now on will be automatically encrypted using AES-256 keys managed by Scaleway.
