Secret types are now displayed in the Scaleway console for better usability of secrets.

All secrets not explicitly tagged appear as opaque, but you can now decide to create new secrets of a specific [type](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#secret-types) (among opaque, username/password, database credentials, SSH key, SSL/TLS certificate and key/value), and secrets versions will be of the same type.

Read [our documentation](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/api-cli/create-secret-with-type/) for more details on how to create secret types using the Scaleway API.
