You can order up to 64 flexible IPs (IPv4 or IPv6) for each of your Elastic Metal servers. These [Elastic Metal flexible IPs](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/concepts/#flexible-ip) can be attached and detached from any of your Elastic Metal servers using the console's drag-and-drop interface.

<Message type="important">
  Scaleway offers flexible IPs for [Elastic Metal servers](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/concepts/#elastic-metal-server), [Instances](/compute/instances/concepts/#instance), and [Public Gateways](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#public-gateway). Each set of flexible IPs is independent and can only be used with its respective product. Instance flexible IPs cannot be attached to Elastic Metal servers or Public Gateways, and vice versa.
