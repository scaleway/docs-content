Creating a Load Balancer for your Kubernetes cluster allows you to expose an application running inside your cluster to the internet.

To create a Load Balancer for your cluster, you must first create a `LoadBalancer` service in your cluster, which is an abstraction describing the Load Balancer you want to create, what you want to expose with it, and how. When this service is created, the Scaleway Cloud Controller Manager will spin up an external Scaleway Load Balancer, with a single IP address that forwards all traffic to the LoadBalancer Service within your cluster. The LoadBalancer service then takes care of forwarding it to the right pods.


By default, Kubernetes clusters are not exposed to the internet. This prevents external users from being able to access the application deployed in your cluster. There are a number of different ways to expose your cluster to the internet: one of them is by creating an external Load Balancer for your cluster. In this document, we explain when and why a Load Balancer may be the right solution for exposing your cluster, and explain the basics of how to create and configure a Load Balancer for your cluster.

## Ingress or LoadBalancer?

When considering whether to expose your application via Ingress (and an Ingress Controller) or a LoadBalancer service, consider the following:

- A Load Balancer on its own may be sufficient if you have one or few services that you want to expose in your cluster. Each service will need its own external Load Balancer and LoadBalancer service.
- A Load Balancer is also most appropriate for dealing with external TCP traffic
- Ingress Controller with an external Load Balancer may be most appropriate if you have multiple services running in your cluster, and you want to direct HTTP traffic from a single external access point, to different services within your cluster, based on a set of rules.

See [how to create an Ingress Controller](TODO) to find out how to easily create an Ingress Controller for your cluster from the Scaleway console. 

Watch our [webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0uKqYXJRF4) for a deeper dive and practical demonstration of how to create an Ingress Controller with a Load Balancer for your cluster (from the 14 minute mark to the 48 minute mark).

Read on to find out how to create a Load Balancer for your cluster without using Ingress.
