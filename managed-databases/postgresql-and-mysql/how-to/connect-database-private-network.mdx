[Private Networks](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#private-network) allows you to configure your own Layer-2 network with IPv4 addresses. You can enhance the security of your system's architecture by isolating it from the Internet.

When using Private Networks, your application connects directly to your Database nodes without going through a Load Balancer.

This improves performance by reducing the latency between your application and your database nodes. It also increases the security of your databases, as Instances in your Private Network can directly communicate with your Database Instance, without passing through the public Internet.

You can create new Database Instances to attach to your Private Network, or attach existing Database Instances by adding Private Networks endpoints to them.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have a [PostgreSQL or MySQL Database Instance](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/quickstart)
  - You have [generated an API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)

## How to attach a Database Instance to a Private Network

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Click the **Private Networks** tabs. The Private Network configuration displays.
4. Click **+ Attach a Private Network**. The Private Network configuration wizard displays.
  * Choose whether to:
    * Select and attach an existing Private Network and select the network from the drop-down list.
    * Create and attach a new Private Network and enter the name of the network in the form.
  * Enter the static IP for the Database Instance. The static IP can be any valid IP from a private address space, as specified in [RFC 1918](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918).
    <Message type="note">
      You can assign a static IP address from your IP range to your Database Instance. Your static IP must be at least the second IP in the range.

    <Message type="tip">
      You can use the database Virtual IP (VIP) in a DHCP-controlled environment by [reserving the IP](/network/public-gateways/how-to/configure-a-public-gateway/#how-to-review-and-configure-dhcp) in the DHCP server configuration to be sure it is not assigned to any other Instance, then configure it on the Private Networks endpoint.

5. Click **Attach a Private Network** to attach the IP address to your Instance. Your static IP is now assigned to the Database Instance:

<Message type="tip">
  Private Networks are also available on [Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/). Refer to the page on [how to use Private Networks](/compute/instances/how-to/use-private-networks/) to attach an Instance to a Private Network and configure a persistent IP address on it.

<Message type="tip">
  If you are using Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule, you can use the [scaleway-k8s-vpc](https://github.com/Sh4d1/scaleway-k8s-vpc) github project to connect a Database Instance to your pods using a Private Network.
  Once your Kapsule node is connected to the Private Network you can directly reach the database by using the service IP you assigned earlier. There is no need to expose it through a Kubernetes resource like a service. The database is ready to use out of the box.
  Warning: The `scaleway-k8s-vpc` is not an officially suported by Scaleway.

## How to detach a Database Instance from a Private Network

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Click the **Private Networks** tabs. The Private Network configuration displays.
4. Click <Icon name="unlink" /> next to the static IP that you want to unlink from your Database Instance.
5. Click **Detach this Instance** to remove the Instance from your Private Network.
