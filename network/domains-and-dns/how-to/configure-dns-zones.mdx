A [DNS zone](/network/domains-and-dns/concepts/#dns-zone) is a distinct part of the [domain namespace](/network/domains-and-dns/concepts/#dns-namespace) and allows granular control of DNS components. 

It contains configuration stored in multiple [DNS records](/network/domains-and-dns/concepts/#dns-record). Each record consists at minimum of a type, a time to live (TTL) and a value. For example, type A records contain information to resolve a domain name to its associated IP address.  

Each **Zone Name** created translates into a [**Domain Name**](/network/domains-and-dns/concepts/#domain-name-domain). For example the zone `myzone` in the domain `example.com` becomes `myzone.example.com`. This works also on multiple levels, meaning that the zone `myzone.subdomain` becomes the domain name `myzone.subdomain.example.com`.
