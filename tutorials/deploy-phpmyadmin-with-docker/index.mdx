Managing a database can be a complex and laborious part when running a web application. 
Softwares like phpMyAdmin exist to make the process much lighter. It is a popular administration tool that allows you to access and manage your databases much more easily.

In this tutorial you learn how to deploy the tool on a [Instance](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/) using the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) InstantApp.

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have [configured your SSH Key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- You have a MySQL database

## Creating a Docker Instance 

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Instances overview displays. 

2. Click **+ Create an Instance**. The instance creation wizzard displays.

3. Configure your Instance: 
    * Choose the availability zone.
    * Select the Instance type (in this tutorial we use a [DEV1-S Instance](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers/create?area=fr-par-1&imageGroup=distribution_ubuntu&imageKey=c1b530d8-0ca0-45c4-80db-ba06608287b2&region=fr-par-1&selectedImageTab=instantapp&selectedServerGroup=Development&serverKey=fr-par-1DEV1-S))
    * Select the Image for the Instance: Click the **InstantApps** tab and select the **Docker** image.
    * If required, configure storage options
    * Enter a name for the instance and optionally tags for it

4. Click **Create a new Instance** to launch its creation. Once the instance is ready, you are redirected to it's information page.

## Deploying phpMyAdmin 

1. Connect to your instance using [SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance):

    ```bash
    ssh root@<your_instance_ip>
    ```

2. Download the [official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/phpmyadmin) by running the following command: 

    ```bash
    docker pull phpmyadmin
    ```

3. Run the container with the following command: 

    ```bash 
    docker run --name phpmyadmin -d -e PMA_HOST=$DB_HOST -e PMA_PORT=$DB_PORT -p 8080:80 phpmyadmin
    ``` 

    * Replace `$DB_HOST` with the hostname or IP of your MySQL server.
    * Replace `$DB_PORT` with the port your MySQL server is listening on.

    If you are using a [Database for MySQL](https://www.scaleway.com/en/databases/) you can find the connection details on the Database information page: 

    <Lightbox src="scaleway_database_information.webp" alt="" />

    </Message>

4. Open a web browser tab and go to `http://<your_instance_ip>:8080`. The phpMyAdmin login displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway_phpmyadmin_login.webp" alt="" />

5. Enter your MySQL credentials and click **Go**. The phpMyAdmin Dashboard displays: 

    <Lightbox src="scaleway_phpmyadmin_dashboard.webp" alt="" />

You can now manage your MySQL databases using the graphical interface of phpMyAdmin.

<Message type="note">

For security reasons you should stop the Docker container after you completed your database maintenance.  
To stop the container run the following command: 

```
docker stop phpmyadmin
```

To restart the container, repeat the steps above.
