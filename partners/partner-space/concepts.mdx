## Client ID

The Client ID represents your clientâ€™s identifier in your own internal management tools. This ID is requested when you add a new client and allows the API to function properly. 

## Consumption

The consumption refers to a customer's use of Scaleway resources. This value is monthly and corresponds to a period running from the first of the month to the last day of the month. 

## Partner Space

The Partner Space is a dedicated interface within the Scaleway console. It allows resellers to manage their clients' consumption and billing. 

## Reseller ID

The reseller ID is your unique Scaleway identifier as a Partner. It is the same as your Organization ID.
