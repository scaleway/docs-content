## What is IPAM?

**IP** **A**ddress **M**anager (IPAM) is Scaleway's tool for planning, tracking, and managing the IP address space of Scaleway products. It acts as a single source of truth for the IP addresses of Scaleway resources, and has a number of associated functionalities to help manage your Scaleway IPs.

## What can I do with IPAM?

**IP** **A**ddress **M**anager (IPAM) is Scaleway's tool for planning, tracking and managing the IP address space of Scaleway products. It acts as a single source of truth for the IP addresses of Scaleway resources. Managed products, such as Databases and Load Balancer, are fully integrated into IPAM, and Private Networks' [DHCP server](/network/vpc/concepts/#dhcp) uses IPAM to assign private, static IP addresses to attached resources.

The public rollout of IPAM functionality is being carried out gradually. IPAM is now in General Availability, offering several different functionalities in the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/ipam/), including viewing, tagging and filtering all your [private IP addresses](#private-ip-address). You can also [reserve](/network/ipam/how-to/reserve-ip/) a private IP on one of your Private Networks and use it to attach a specified resource to the network.

Management of public (flexible) IP addresses with IPAM is planned for the future.

## Can I use a reserved private IP to attach any kind of resource to a Private Network?

Currently, the Scaleway console only supports attachment with a reserved IP for Instances, Load Balancers and Public Gateways. You can attach Elastic Metal servers to a Private Network using a reserved IP via the [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/elastic-metal/private-network-api/#path-private-networks-add-a-server-to-a-private-network). Support for attachment of reserved IPs for both Elastic Metal servers and Managed Databases in the console will be coming soon.

## Can I use a reserved private IP with a virtual machine hosted on my Elastic Metal server?

Yes, this functionality is now available via the Scaleway console and API. See [how to reserve a private IP address with an attached MAC address](/network/ipam/how-to/reserve-ip/#how-to-reserve-a-private-ip-address-with-an-attached-mac-address).
