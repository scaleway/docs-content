## What is Scaleway Database?


Scaleway Database provides fully-managed relational database Instances, supporting the database engines PostgreSQL and MySQL.

The product lets you focus on development, rather than administration or configuration. It comes with high-availability mode, data replication, and automatic backups.

In comparison to traditional database management, which requires customers to provision their infrastructure and resources to manage their databases, Scaleway Database offers the user access to a database instance without the need for setting up the hardware or configuring the software. Scaleway handles the provisioning, manages the configuration, and provides useful features as high availability, Automated Backup, User management, and more.


## How can I access my database once it is provisioned?


On the details page of your Instance, the IP address and your Instance’s port are shown:

<Lightbox src="scaleway_database1.png" alt="" />

It is possible to connect to your Instance from any application using the IP address and port shown in the **Endpoint** section and the login/password of any valid database user. This can be managed from the “users” tab.


**PostgreSQL** 

To access your Scaleway Database for PostgreSQL Instance, use the psql command-line tool with the following command:
```psql -h $IP -p $PORT -U $YOUR_USER -d $DATABASE_NAME```
You will have to enter your password to establish the connection. The default `$DATABASE_NAME` to be used is `rdb`.


**MySQL**

You can access your Scaleway Database for MySQL Instance with the following command:

```mysql -h $IP --port $PORT -p -u $USERNAME```
You will be prompted to enter your password to log in.


## How do I import data into a Scaleway Database?


**PostgreSQL**

To import data into your Scaleway Database for PostgreSQL, export your data using the `pg_dump` command in a first step:

```pg_dump -h OLD_DB_IP -p OLD_DB_PORT -U OLD_DB_USERNAME -F c -b -v -f "/usr/local/backup/database.backup" DATABASE_NAME```

Once the data is exported, import the database using the pg_restore command:

```pg_restore -h INSTANCE_IP -p INSTANCE_PORT -U USERNAME -d DATABASE_NAME -v "/usr/local/backup/database.backup"```

The different parameters used in the commands represent the following values:

`-h` (--host): IP address of the host
`-p` (--port): Port number of the host
`-U` (--username): PostgreSQL user
`-F` (--format): Format
`c:` c just after a -F means that the format is the binary format specific to postgreSQL
`-b` (--blobs): Specifies the binary string type
`-v` (--verbose)
`-f` (--file): Specifies the file name

**MySQL**

If you want to import your existing database into a Scaleway Database for MySQL, start by exporting your data using the command `mysqldump`:

```mysqldump -u username -p old_database > backup.sql```
Then import the backup into your Scaleway Database for `MySQL`:

```mysql -u username -p new_database < backup.sql```


## Which postgreSQL extensions are available?

The following `pg_extensions` are available for Scaleway Database:

## How do I backup my database?


If the automatic backup feature is enabled, new backups will be created according to your backup schedule, which can be set on the "Instance overview” tab. Your instance is available during backup, but there might be a performance impact and some actions may not be available.
Automatic backups are enabled by default. It is possible to disable them at any time in the backup settings of your Instance. 
It is also possible to launch manual backups by clicking on the **Create a backup** button from the backups tab.
