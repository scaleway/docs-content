## Problem

My container runs out of memory (OOM) and crashes or restarts.

## Possible cause
	
In Sandbox v1 and v2, some directories are mounted as `tmpfs` for temporary in-memory storage. In Sandbox v2, directories such as `/tmp` and `/dev` are stored in memory.

Excessive writes to `/tmp` can fill up the provisioned memory, leading to out-of-memory (OOM) errors, potentially triggering a container restart.

## Solutions

- Avoid writing temporary files in `/tmp`.
- Use alternative storage paths within your container
- Increase the container's memory allocation to accommodate for temporary file usage

Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/serverless-containers/reference-content/containers-sandbox/) for more information on Sandboxes.
