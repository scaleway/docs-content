This page shows you how to change your [Scaleway account](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements) password.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements)

1. Go to your [Account Security](https://console.scaleway.com/settings/account/security) page.
2. Scroll down to the **Change password** section and click the **Change password** button. A pop-up appears.
3. Enter your current password and your new password in the corresponding boxes.
    If you prefer, you can click the magic wand icon to autogenerate a strong password.
4. Click **Update password** to confirm the changes.

    Your password is now updated.

If you have lost your password and cannot access the Scaleway console, refer to the [How to recover a lost password](/account/how-to/recover-a-lost-password) documentation for help regaining access to your account.
