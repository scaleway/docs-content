In this how-to guide you learn how to create and push a container image to the Scaleway [Container Registry](/containers/container-registry/concepts/#container-registry) and how to use it on [Kubernetes Kapsule](/containers/kubernetes/concepts/#kubernetes-kapsule/).

A container image consists of several bundled files, which encapsulate an application. This image can be built on a local machine, uploaded to the image registry, and then deployed on several Kubernetes pods with Kapsule. [Kapsule](/containers/kubernetes/concepts/#kubernetes-kapsule) is the managed [Kubernetes](https://www.kubernetes.io/) service provided by Scaleway. In this tutorial we use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to build the containers.

The generated Docker images are stored in a private Docker registry using the Scaleway [Container Registry](/containers/container-registry/concepts/#container-registry) product.

## How to push an image to the Container Registry

<Message type="note">
  To complete the following steps, it is required that you have a local project with a `Dockerfile` to build a container image from it. If you do not have a Docker project yet, you may follow our [tutorial](/tutorials/install-docker-ubuntu-bionic) to create the required files.
</Message>


1. Open a terminal window on your local computer. 
2. Check that all required files are available to build the container image by running the `ls -l` command in the directory of your project:
    ```bash
    $ ls -l
    total 32
    -rw-r--r--  1 myuser  staff   903 Oct 14 12:19 Dockerfile
    -rw-r--r--  1 myuser  staff  1080 Oct 14 12:19 LICENSE
    -rw-r--r--  1 myuser  staff   476 Oct 14 12:19 Makefile
    -rw-r--r--  1 myuser  staff  1721 Oct 14 12:19 README.md
    drwxr-xr-x  3 myuser  staff    96 Oct 14 12:19 patches
    ```
3. Use the following commands to build the Docker container image locally before pushing it to your private Container Registry. The parameter `-t` configures the tags of the container:
    ```bash
    $ docker build -t mycontainer:latest .
    ```
    ```
    Sending build context to Docker daemon  197.6kB
    ...
    ...
    ...
    ---> c427b132b5fc
    Successfully built c427b132b5fc
    Successfully tagged mycontainer:latest
    ```
4. Check that the image has been added to the local Docker installation by running the `docker images` command. Your newly created container image will be displayed in the list of available images:
    ```bash
    $ docker images
    REPOSITORY                                             TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
    mycontainer                                            latest              c427b132b5fc        22 minutes ago      1.24GB
    ```
5. [Log into your Container Registry](/containers/container-registry/how-to/connect-docker-cli). The endpoint (for example: `rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/myregistry`) of your Container Registry is available from the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com/registry/namespaces) and depends on your configuration:
    ```bash
    $ docker login rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/myregistry -u nologin -p $SCW_SECRET_KEY
    ```
    A `Login Succeeded` message displays once logged in.
6. Tag the image using the `docker tag` command. Make sure to replace the URL of the registry with your personal endpoint:
    ```bash
    $ docker tag mycontainer:latest rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/myregistry/mycontainer:latest
    ```
7. Push the image to the registry using the `docker push` command:
    ```bash
    $ docker push rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/myregistry/mycontainer:latest
    ```
    ```
    ...
    ...

    ```

## How to create an Image Pull Secret

To deploy the previously created container image in a Kapsule cluster, you need to create an Image Pull Secret. This allows your Kapsule cluster to connect to your Container Registry and pull the image itself. For this, your [API Secret Key](/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key) is required.

<Message type="note">
  - Make sure that your [Kapsule cluster](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/connect-cluster-kubectl) is configured on your local computer before continuing.  
  - We suppose that all resources are living in the same [Kubernetes Namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/). The default namespace is named `default`.
</Message>

1. Run `kubectl` to define a secret called `registry-secret` using the `$SCW_SECRET_KEY` variable as follows:
    ```bash
    $ kubectl create secret docker-registry registry-secret --docker-server=rg.fr-par.scw.cloud --docker-username=my-registry-namespace --docker-password=$SCW_SECRET_KEY
    ```
    <Message type="important">
      Replace the value for `docker-server` with the address of your Container Registry (eg if it is in the Amsterdam or Warsaw regions), and the value for `docker-username` with the name of your Container Registry namespace.
    </Message>
2. Display the generated secret with the `kubectl get secret` command. The flag `--output=yaml` will return the output formatted in [YAML](https://yaml.org/):
    ```bash
    $ kubectl get secret registry-secret --output=yaml
    ```
    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      .dockerconfigjson: eyJhdXRocyI6eyJyZy5mci1wYXIuc2N3LmNsb3VkIjp7InVzZXJuYW1lIjoibXl1c2VyIiwicGFzc3dvcmQiOiJkYTI0N2E0Yi1hZDk4LTQ2NGYtOTdhYy1hOGIwNTZmYjU2NWYiLCJlbWFpbCI6Im15QGVtYWlsLmNvbSIsImF1dGgiOiJiWGwxYzJWeU9tUmhNalEzWVRSaUxXRmtPVGd0TkRZMFppMDVOMkZqTFdFNFlqQTFObVppTlRZMVpnPT0ifX19

## How to create a deployment for the container

1. Create a file `deployment.yaml` and open it in a text editor, e.g. `nano`:
    ```bash
    $ nano deployment.yaml
    ```
2. Copy the following content into it, save the file and quit the text editor.  

    Remember to replace the **image name** `rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/myregistry/mycontainer:latest` and **registry secret** `registry-secret` with the values you previously defined.
      
    ```
      apiVersion: apps/v1
      kind: Deployment
      metadata:
        name: mydeployment
        labels:
          app: mydeployment
      spec:
        replicas: 2
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            app: mydeployment
        template:
          metadata:
            labels:
              app: mydeployment
          spec:
            containers:
              - name: mycontainer
                image: rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/myregistry/mycontainer:latest
            imagePullSecrets:
              - name: registry-secret
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      In the configuration above, the secret and deployments are in the same namespace.
    </Message>
3. Run `kubectl apply` to apply the deployment to the cluster:
    ```bash
    $ kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
    ```
4. Use the `kubectl get pods` command to check the status of the deployment:
    ```bash
    $ kubectl get pods
    ```

    ```
    NAME                            READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
    mydeployment-64c9fdd66c-66mrq   1/1     Running            0          2m
    mydeployment-64c9fdd66c-pwhl9   1/1     running            0          2m
    ```

As you can see in the output above, the image has been pulled successfully from the registry and two replicas of it are running on the Kapsule cluster.
