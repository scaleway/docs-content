Traffic management configuration lets you define how your Load Balancer's backend forwards traffic to its final destination backend servers.

1. Select a **balancing method**. This determines how the backend distributes requests between its backend servers. The following methods are available:
        * **Round-robin (default)**: Requests are sent to each backend server in turn.
        * **Least connections**: Requests are forwarded to the backend server with the fewest current connections. 
        * **First available**: Requests are forwarded to the first backend server with available connection slots.

2. Add the **Server IP addresses** of the servers the Load Balancer will forward requests/connections to. These will be your backend servers. They must be Scaleway resources (Instances, Elastic Metal or Dedibox servers) unless you have a [Multi-Cloud](/load-balancer/faq/#what-is-the-difference-between-multi-cloud-and-non-multi-cloud-offers) Load Balancer, in which case this restriction does not apply. Scaleway backend servers can be in any AZ, and are not restricted to the same AZ as the Load Balancer.

        <Message type="note">
        If you want your Load Balancer to communicate with its backend servers over an attached [Private Network](/vpc/concepts/#private-networks), ensure that you enter the servers' private IP addresses. This is necessary in the case of a [private Load Balancer](/load-balancer/reference-content/public-private-accessibility/#private-load-balancers), but may also be desired for public Load Balancers attached to Private Networks where backend servers are in the same VPC. As Load Balancers are compatible with [VPC routing](/vpc/reference-content/understanding-routing/), they will be able to direct requests to any backend server within the same VPC, via its private IP address. The Load Balancer and backend server do not have to be on the same Private Network in that VPC.

3. Choose whether to activate **sticky sessions** (default setting is deactivated). Sticky sessions enable the Load Balancer to bind a given user's sessions to a specific backend server. If you choose to activate sticky sessions, you are prompted to select either **IP-based** (clients' IPs are used to bind sessions) or **cookie-based** (an HTTP cookie is used to bind sessions, and you must choose a name for the cookie).
