## Migration methods and tools

Migrating to the cloud can take different forms depending on your infrastructure, business goals, and long-term strategy.

Choosing the right method depends on your priorities: speed, cost, flexibility, or long-term innovation. Below are the main migration methods you can choose from when planning for your migration.

  <TabsTab label="Lift and Shift">

    Lift and shift is the most direct migration strategy. Applications and workloads are moved “as-is” from their current environment to the cloud, with minimal to no modifications. It focuses on speed and simplicity rather than optimization.

    **When to use it**

    - You need to migrate quickly, with minimal downtime.
    - Your priority is moving out of on-premises infrastructure or another provider.
    - You want a foundation in the cloud before making further optimizations.
  </TabsTab>
  <TabsTab label="Replatforming">

   Replatforming involves making minor adjustments to workloads during migration to take advantage of cloud features, without fully redesigning the application.

    **When to use it**

    - You want to reduce operational complexity.
    - Your goal is to gain some cloud-native benefits (e.g. automated scaling, managed storage).
    - Your applications are stable but can benefit from optimizations.
  </TabsTab>
  <TabsTab label="Refactoring">

    Refactoring goes further by modifying the application code to better align with cloud-native services and architectures.

    **When to use it**

    - You want to modernize applications for better scalability and resilience.
    - You want to integrate managed services (databases, event-driven systems, etc.).
    - Your current architecture is functional but starting to limit growth.
  </TabsTab>
  <TabsTab label="Rearchitecting">

    Rearchitecting means redesigning applications from the ground up to fully leverage cloud-native principles, such as microservices, serverless, and distributed computing.

    **When to use it**

    - Legacy systems limit innovation and agility.
    - You want to build for long-term scalability and resilience.
    - You need to support advanced workloads like AI, big data, or edge computing.
  </TabsTab>
  <TabsTab label="Replacement">

    Instead of migrating an existing system, some organizations choose to replace applications with new cloud-native solutions or SaaS alternatives.

    **When to use it**

    - The existing system is outdated or too costly to adapt.
    - SaaS or managed solutions provide more value.
    - You want to simplify infrastructure and focus resources on core business goals.
