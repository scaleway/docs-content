    <Message type="tip">
    Flexible IPs attached to your server will be detached during server deletion and released back into your [Flexible IP pool](https://console.scaleway.com/elastic-metal/flexible-ips/). 
    You can then attach them to another Elastic Metal server. If you no longer need them, remember to delete them separately.
