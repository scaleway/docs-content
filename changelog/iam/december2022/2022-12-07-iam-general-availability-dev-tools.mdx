Projects can be created, managed and deleted from the CLI, Terraform and other developer tools maintained by Scaleway.

IAM must be used to generate an API key with the permissions to manage Projects.

Find out more on the [Managing projects using Scaleway APIs](/identity-and-access-management/iam/api-cli/managing-projects/) documentation page.
