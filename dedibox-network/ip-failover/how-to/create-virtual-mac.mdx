Virtualization requires, in most cases, that you configure additional IP addresses on your dedicated server to provide network connectivity to your virtual machines.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net)
  - You have [created](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/order-a-server) a Dedibox dedicated server
  - You have ordered a [failover IP](/dedibox-network/ip-failover/concepts/#failover-ips)

In general two connectivity modes are possible for the networking of virtual machines:

* Bridge
* NAT

### Bridged network

In bridge mode, the network equipment sees your server and your virtual machines as different servers.
For security reasons, no other network equipment is allowed on our network, except for the MAC address of your physical network card.

If you start a virtual machine in bridge mode, protection will be activated on the switch, and your network port will be closed.
You can add virtual MAC addresses known and allowed on the network to solve this problem.

### NATed network

In this network setup, all of your virtual machines are assigned the same public IP address through a NAT configuration. This arrangement makes your physical server and its virtual machines appear as a unified entity. The only MAC address that is broadcasted on the network is that of your physical network card.
As a result, there is no need for individual virtual MAC addresses in this configuration.

## How to add a virtual MAC address

1. Click **Server** > **Server list** to display a list of your physical machines.
2. Select the server you want to configure and click **Manage**. The servers' status page displays.
3. Scroll down to the network configuration section and click **+ Info** next to the failover IP you want to configure. The advanced configuration displays.
4. Click **Add virtual MAC**. The virtual MAC configuration displays.
5. Click the cogwheel next to the IP address you want to configure. Then select the type of MAC address and click **Add ... virtual MAC address**.
    <Message type="note">
    Each MAC address is associated with manufacturer/organization. We provide virtual MAC addresses from the following Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI):
    * OUI VMWare: `00:50:56`
    * OUI Xen: `00:16:3e`
    * OUI KVM: `52:54:00`
    You can choose the OUI of your preference. They are technically interchangable.

Once the virtual MAC is activated, use it to configure the network of your VM.

## How to delete a virtual MAC address

You can remove the virtual MAC address associated to a failover IP if you do not require it any longer.

<Message type="tip">
  When you choose to delete a virtual MAC address on an IP address that shares its virtual MAC with other IPs, only the link between this specific IP address and the MAC is deleted, the other IP addresses are not updated.
</Message>

1. Click **Server** > **Server list** to display a list of your physical machines.
2. Select the server you want to configure and click **Manage**. The servers' status page displays.
3. Scroll down to the network configuration section and click **+ Info** next to the failover IP you want to configure. The advanced configuration displays.
4. Click **Edit**. The virtual MAC configuration displays.
5. Click the cogwheel next to the IP address you want to configure. Then click **Delete virtual MAC address**.

    The configuration of the failover IP will be updated, and the virtual MAC address will be deleted.
