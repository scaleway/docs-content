Serverless SQL Databases offers near-complete PostgreSQL compatibility, and allows you to import your data from any PostgreSQL-compatible database.

<Message type="important">
The methods listed below are best suited for database sizes below 100 GB (approx.). Above this size, we recommend you use dedicated tooling to perform this operation, as your local storage size and bandwidth will create bottlenecks, and the operation may last several hours.
</Message>

The import procedure depends on your data source:
    - [Importing data from an existing PostgreSQL database](#importing-data-from-an-existing-postgresql-database)
      - [Using pg_dump](#using-pgdump)
      - [Using pgAdmin](#using-pgadmin)
    - [Importing data from an existing PostgreSQL backup](#importing-data-from-an-existing-postgresql-backup)
    - [Importing data from a file (.csv, .txt, etc.)](#importing-data-from-a-file-csv-txt-etc)

## Importing data from an existing PostgreSQL database

### Using pg_dump

#### Before you start

To complete the actions presented below, you must have:

- Installed PostgreSQL 16 (or newer) with [pg_dump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html) and [pg_restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgrestore.html) (bundled with the default PostgreSQL installation).

- [Created a target Serverless SQL Database](/serverless/sql-databases/how-to/create-a-database) to import your data into.

- Checked that the target database you are importing into is empty, or contains data you can overwrite.

#### Downloading and importing data into a Serverless SQL Database

1. Run the following command to download a local export of your database with `pg_dump`, then enter your password when prompted:

    ```
    pg_dump --no-privileges --no-owner -U {username} -h {host} --port {port} -Fc {databasename} > my-backup
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
    You can download specific tables using the `-t` option:

      ```
      pg_dump -t table1name -t table2name --no-privileges --no-owner -U {username} -h {host} --port {port} -Fc {databasename} > my-backup
      ```
    </Message>

2. When finished, make sure the backup is downloaded on your local machine. The default location is in the current directory, under `/my-backup`.

3. Run the command below to import data into your Serverless SQL Database using `pg_restore`. Make sure to replace the placeholders with your Serverless SQL Database connection parameters:

    ```
    pg_restore --no-privileges --no-owner --clean --if-exists -U {username} -h {host} --port 5432 -d {databasename} my-backup
    ```

    <Message type="note">
    You can find this information on the [overview page](https://console.scaleway.com/serverless-db/databases) of your database.
    </Message>

4. Enter the database password when prompted. 

    <Message type="note">
    The password is the [IAM secret key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#api-key) corresponding to the [IAM user](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#user) or [IAM application](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#application) you are connecting with. 
    </Message>

5. When finished, make sure your data is stored in your new database by [connecting to it](/serverless/sql-databases/how-to/connect-to-a-database/), and performing a query.

### Using pgAdmin

#### Before you start

To complete the actions presented below, you must have:

- Installed [pg_Admin](https://www.pgadmin.org/).

- Ensured your PGAdmin version is compatible with the PostgreSQL version of the database you will import your data into. Currently, pgAdmin 7.8 or newer is required to fully work with PostgreSQL 16.

- [Created a target Serverless SQL Database](/serverless/sql-databases/how-to/create-a-database) to import your data into.

- Checked that the target database you are importing into is empty, or contains data you can overwrite.

#### Downloading the backup on your local machine

1. Open pgAdmin.

2. Connect to your existing database server by selecting it in the left-hand menu.

3. In the **Databases* submenu, connect to the database you want to export by selecting it.

4. In the left-hand menu, right-click the database you want to export, and select **Backup**.

5. Enter a name for the backup file (e.g. `my-backup`), and keep the default **format** and **compression** options.

6. Click **Backup**. The backup creation process starts, and you can follow its progress by clicking **View processes**.

7. When finished, make sure your backup is downloaded on your local machine. By default, the backup location is `Users/{username}/my-backup` on MacOS.

#### Loading your data in your Serverless SQL Database

1. Register your new database in pgAdmin. Refer to the [How to connect to a Serverless SQL Database](/serverless/sql-databases/how-to/connect-to-a-database/#how-to-set-up-credentials) documentation for more information.

2. Connect to your database server by selecting it in the left-hand menu.

3. Select your database in the **Databases* submenu.

4. In the left-hand menu, right-click the name of your new database, then select **Restore**.

5. Enter the file name of your backup (e.g. `my-backup`), and keep the default options.

6. Access the **Data options** tab, and enable the **Do not save - Owner** and **Do not save - Privileges** options.

7. (Optional) If your new database is not empty, access the **Query Options** tab, and enable the **Clean before restore** option. 

    <Message type="tip">
    This option ensures your database is emptied before loading data to avoid potential conflicts with existing data (such as table names or primary key constraints).
    </Message>

8. Click **Restore**. The restore process starts, and you can follow its progress by clicking **View processes**.

9. When finished, make sure your data is stored in your new database by [connecting to it](/serverless/sql-databases/how-to/connect-to-a-database/), and performing a query.

If the process fails and some data were partly already transferred, we suggest you activate the **Clean before restore** option in the **Data options** tab to remove partly transferred data.

## Importing data from an existing PostgreSQL backup

### Using pg_restore

#### Before you start

To complete the actions presented below, you must have:

- Installed PostgreSQL 16 (or newer) with [pg_restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgrestore.html) (bundled with the default PostgreSQL installation).

- [Created a target Serverless SQL Database](/serverless/sql-databases/how-to/create-a-database) to import your data into.

- Checked that the target database you are importing into is empty, or contains data you can overwrite.

- A backup file for your database (named `my-backup` in the following procedure). 

1. In a terminal, access the directory containing the backup file, then run the command below to import data to your Serverless SQL Database using `pg_restore`. Make sure to replace the placeholders with your Serverless SQL Database connection parameters:

    ```
    pg_restore --no-privileges --no-owner --clean --if-exists -U {username} -h {host} --port 5432 -d {databasename} my-backup
    ```

    <Message type="note">
    You can find this information on the [overview page](https://console.scaleway.com/serverless-db/databases) of your database. The password is the [IAM Secret Key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#api-key) corresponding to the [IAM user](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#user) or [IAM application](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#application) you are connecting with. 
    </Message>

2. When finished, make sure your data is stored in your new database by [connecting to it](/serverless/sql-databases/how-to/connect-to-a-database/), and performing a query.

## Import Data from a file (.csv, .txt, etc.)

### Using psql

#### Before you start

To complete the actions presented below, you must have:

- Installed PostgreSQL 16 (or newer) with [pg_restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgrestore.html) (bundled with the default PostgreSQL installation).

- [Created a target Serverless SQL Database](/serverless/sql-databases/how-to/create-a-database) to import your data into.

- Checked that the target database you are importing into is empty, or contains data you can overwrite.

- A data file corresponding to a single table (named named `my-table.csv` in the following procedure).

<Message type="tip">
You can create a `.csv` file from an existing PostgreSQL table with the [COPY TO command](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html), as shown below:

```sql
\COPY {tablename} TO './my-table.csv' WITH DELIMITER ',' CSV;
```
</Message>

1. In a termminal, access the folder containing your data file:

    ```
    cd path/to/my-table.csv
    ```

2. Connect to your Serverless SQL Database using psql:

    ```sh
    psql "postgresql://{username}:{password}@{host}:5432/{databasename}?sslmode=require"
    ```

    <Message type="note">
    You can find this information on the [overview page](https://console.scaleway.com/serverless-db/databases) of your database. The password is the [IAM secret key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#api-key) corresponding to the [IAM user](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#user) or [IAM application](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#application) you are connecting with. 
    </Message>

3. Create the table structure corresponding to your file column types:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE {tablename} (column1name type1, column2name type2, ...);
   ```

4. Run the command below to load your data to your Serverless SQL Database using the [psql \copy command](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html#APP-PSQL-META-COMMANDS-COPY):

    ```sql
    \copy {tablename} FROM './my-table.csv' WITH DELIMITER ',' CSV;
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      The PostgreSQL [COPY command](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html) cannot be used directly, as it requires the source file to be available on the PostgreSQL instance itself.
    </Message>

5. When finished, make sure your data is stored in your new database by [connecting to it](/serverless/sql-databases/how-to/connect-to-a-database/), and performing a query.
