Scaleway Apple silicon as-a-Service uses Apple Mac mini hardware. These devices rely on the power of Apple's silicon technology, ensuring exceptional performance and groundbreaking energy efficiency.

Apple silicon as-a-Service is tailored for developing, building, testing, and signing applications for Apple devices such as iPhones, iPads, Mac computers, and more. The Mac mini boasts a sophisticated neural engine that significantly enhances machine learning capabilities.

## Requirements

- Be the [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) of the Organization in which the actions will be performed, or an IAM user with the [necessary permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission)
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/) added to your account

## How to create a Mac mini

<Message type="important">
  - Due to license constraints, the minimum lease for Apple silicon is 24 hours. As a result, the earliest you can delete a Mac mini is 24 hours after the start of its lease.
</Message>

1. Click **Apple silicon** in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu. The [Apple silicon creation page](https://console.scaleway.com/asaas/servers) displays.
2. Click **Create Mac mini**. The Mac mini creation wizard displays.
3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Select the commitment plan for your Mac mini. Two options are available:
      - **No commitment:** You can terminate the subscription of your Mac mini at any time after the initial 24 hours, a mandatory period required by Apple's software license. [Learn more about Apple's software license requirements (Section 3.A)](https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/macOSSequoia.pdf).
      - **Commitment:** You subscribe to a [commitment plan for Apple silicon](/apple-silicon/concepts/#commitment-plan) and benefit from a discounted monthly price based on your choice.
      <Message type="important">
        Currently, it is not possible to switch from a monthly commitment to hourly billing.
      </Message>
    - Choose an **Availability Zone**, which is the geographical region where your Mac mini will be deployed. The available Mac mini configurations depend on the Availability Zone:
      - Mac mini M4, M2 pro, and M2 are available in PARIS 1
      - Mac mini M1 are available in PARIS 3
    - Choose a macOS version.
        <Message type="note">
          If you choose a macOS other than the one installed by default, there will be a delay of about 1 hour before the Mac mini is made available.
        </Message>
    - Enter a **Name** for your Mac mini, or leave the randomly-generated name in place.
    - Verify the **Estimated cost** for your Mac mini based on your chosen specifications.
4. Tick the checkbox to agree to the Bare Metal specific conditions and the macOS License Agreement.
5. Click **Create Mac mini** to finish. The installation of your Apple silicon is launched, and you are informed when it is ready.

## How to connect to your Mac mini

### How to connect via remote desktop

You can access your Mac mini using VNC, a remote desktop-sharing protocol. It allows you to visualize the graphical screen output of a remote computer and transfer local keyboard and mouse events to the remote computer using a network connection.

Refer to our detailed documentation for Windows, Linux, and macOS for OS specific information: [How to access the remote desktop of a Mac mini](/apple-silicon/how-to/access-remote-desktop-mac-mini/).

<Message type="important">
  The VNC port on Mac mini systems is **randomly assigned** during system installation and may therefore be different from the default VNC port 5900. To connect successfully via VNC, use the specific port shown in the **Overview** section of your Mac mini’s configuration.
  For manual connections, ensure that the port from the **Overview** section is correctly entered in your VNC client settings, as this is necessary for a successful connection.

## How to connect using SSH

1. Navigate to the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) and log in with your credentials.
2. Click **Apple silicon** under the **Bare Metal** section in the side-menu. This displays a list of your Mac minis.
3. Click the name of the Mac mini you want to connect to. The **Overview** page for your selected Mac mini displays.
4. Open your terminal application and use the SSH command provided on the **Overview** page to connect.
   - The SSH command will be in the format:
     ```sh
     ssh your_mac_mini_username@<your_mac_mini_ip>
     ```
   - Replace `<your_mac_mini_username>` with your Mac mini username.
   - Replace `<your_mac_mini_ip>` with the actual IP address of your Mac mini.


## How to delete a Mac mini
