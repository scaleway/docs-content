If your Database Instance uses an End of Life engine version and is no longer maintained, we recommend that you upgrade your engine version.
 
<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have a [PostgreSQL or MySQL Database Instance](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/create-a-database) running on an End of Life engine version
</Message>

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-rdb-engine-version-upgrade.webp" alt="List of Database Instances in the Scaleway console. A warning sign displays under the name of the Database Instance that has an End of Life engine version. Next to the warning, an upgrade hyperlink displays" />
2. Click **Upgrade** next to the Database Instance you wish to upgrade the database engine for. A pop-up appears.
    <Message type="tip">
      Alternatively you can click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info**, then click **Upgrade** under **Database engine** in the Database Instances information page.
    </Message>

    <Message type="note">
      The **Upgrade version** option is only available for:
        - Database Instances using End of Life engine versions.
        - Database Instances using Block volumes. If your Database Instance uses a local volume, you must first [change the volume type](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/change-volume-type) to a Block volume and try again.

3. Make sure that you have read and agree with the conditions of the upgrade. 
    <Message type="note">
        You can currently only upgrade to the next major version. This means that if you have a Database Instance running on PostgreSQL 10, you will be upgraded to PostgreSQL 11. If you want to upgrade to the most recent version of an engine, you must create a new Database Instance and [migrate your databases](/tutorials/migrate-databases-instance/).
    </Message>
4. Click **Upgrade version**. A new Database Instance is created.
    <Message type="important">
      When you upgrade a version, a clone of your current Database Instance with an up-to-date engine version is created. Your current Database Instance will remain available with its original endpoints, and will still be billed.<br /><br />The new, upgraded Database Instance will have new endpoints. To use it, replace the old endpoints with the new across all your applications. The upgrade does not impact your original Database Instance. Even after manually updating your endpoints, you can roll back to the old ones at any time.
    </Message> 

    <Message type="important">
      On PostgreSQL, engine extensions are handled and upgraded automatically during the upgrade process.
