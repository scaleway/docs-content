When creating a secret, its value is stored in its first version, which is enabled by default. At creation, your secret only has one version.
This page explains how to add more [versions](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#version) to a secret using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).
