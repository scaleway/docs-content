To ensure the security of your Scaleway Dedibox account, it is strongly advised that you regularly verify and update your contact details, especially your email address.
This precaution helps prevent potential account lockouts if you lose access to both your console password and email account.

In the unlikely event that you encounter such a situation, follow these steps to recover access to your Scaleway Dedibox account.

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)

### How to recover your password

If you cannot access your email account, send us a contact update request with the following details:

- Your current and new email addresses
- Your postal address
- Two distinct identity documents (e.g., passport or local ID card for individuals, incorporation certificate for companies)-
- A reachable phone number for contact purposes
- A copy of your most recent Scaleway Dedibox invoice (or the amount charged if you do not have the invoice)
- A card statement displaying the Scaleway bill debit

Submit the complete set of required documents via email to [document@scaleway.com](mailto:document@scaleway.com).

Upon receiving your application, we will proceed with updating your email address, subject to validation.

Once your email address is updated, you can submit a [lost password form](https://console.online.net/en/user/recovery) to request the recovery codes for your account.
