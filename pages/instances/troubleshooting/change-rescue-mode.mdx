Rescue mode is a feature that allows you to boot your Instance on a temporary OS over the network, giving you access to your Instance's file system to troubleshoot and repair issues.
This is particularly useful when your Instance is not booting properly due to configuration errors, corrupted files, or other system issues, and you need to recover data or make repairs without affecting the original system.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/)
- A valid [API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)

## Updating rescue mode from the Scaleway console

1. Click **CPU & GPU Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The [Instances page](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) displays.
2. Click the name of the Instance that is using the previous rescue mode. The Instance overview displays.
3. Stop the Instance if it is currently running by using the top right toggle of the Instances overview page.
4. Click the **Advanced settings** tab.
5. Scroll to the **Boot mode** section and change the boot mode of your Instance to **local boot**.
6. Power the Instance on again by using the toggle.
    <Message type="tip">
      If you want to use rescue mode again, change the boot type back to **rescue mode** to reboot the Instance using the latest rescue mode.
    </Message>

## Updating rescue mode using the Scaleway API

1. [List the Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/#path-instances-list-all-instances) of your Project(s).
2. Filter the returned Instances to keep only the ones with `boot_type: "rescue"`.
3. [Stop the Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/#path-instances-perform-action)
4. [Update the Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/#path-instances-update-an-instance) and set `boot_type: "local"`
  <Message type="tip">
    If you still want to use rescue mode for your Instance(s), update these Instances again and switch back the `boot_type` to “rescue”. They will then use the updated rescue system.
