This page shows how to create and manage [topics](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#topic) with Scaleway Topics and Events (formerly part of the Messaging and Queuing product).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to create a topic

1. Click **Topics and Events** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. 

2. Click **Create topic**. The topic creation wizard displays.

3. Choose a region in which to create your topic.

4. Enter a **name** for your topic. The name must contain no more than 80 characters, and consist only of alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. Alternatively, you can go with the auto-generated name suggested for you.

5. Choose a **topic type**. The following topic types are available:
    -  **Standard**: Ensures at-least-once message delivery, where the order of messages is not preserved. Supports Serverless Functions, Serverless Containers and HTTP/S subscriptions. 
    - **FIFO**: Provides first-in-first-out delivery, where the order of messages is preserved without duplication. Supports Scaleway Queues subscriptions. [Content-based deduplication](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#content-based-deduplication) is only available for FIFO topics.

6. Click **Create topic** to finish.

You are returned to the **Topics** tab, where your newly-created topic now displays. The topic's URL is also displayed here, for use in your API/CLI operations.

<Message type="tip">
Remember that you need to [create credentials](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-credentials/) in order to access your Topics and Events service and its topics from an API or CLI. Sending messages to topics requires that credentials have the `can_publish` permission, while receiving messages from topics requires the `can_receive` permission. You can create separate credentials if you need to isolate these two roles in your application.
</Message>

## How to delete a topic

When you no longer want a topic, you can delete it. This action is irreversible and deletes the topic along with all its associated subscriptions.

1. Click **Topics and Events** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. 

2. Use the drop-down menu to select the [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) containing the topic you want to delete.

3. Either:
    - Click the topic you wish to delete. The topic's **Settings** page displays. Click the **Delete topic** button in the bottom right corner.
    - Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the topic you wish to delete, then select **Delete** from the menu that displays.

    A pop-up asks you to confirm that you understand this action will delete the topic and all of its associated subscriptions.

4. Type **DELETE** and click **Delete topic**.
