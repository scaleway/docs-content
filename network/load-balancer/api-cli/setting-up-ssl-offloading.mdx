SSL offloading can be configured using the Load Balancers API.

<Macro id="requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/organization).
</Message>

Before configuring the Load Balancer from the API, prepare your environment to facilitate the API usage. Recover the `secret_key` and the `organization_id` from the Scaleway console or the [API](/identity-and-access-management/iam/api-cli/managing-projects/#creating-a-project) and set them as environment variables. 
Make sure you also have configured the geographical location of your Load Balancer:
```json
export TOKEN="<secret_key>"
REGION="<choose your location (nl-ams/fr-par)>"
ORGANIZATION_ID="<your organization ID>"
```

1. Create a new Load Balancer by running the following API call. Customize the `name`, `description` and `tags`:
    ```
    curl -X POST "https://api.scaleway.com/lb/v1/regions/$REGION/lbs" -H "accept: application/json" -H "X-Auth-Token: $SECRET_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"description\":\"YOUR DESCRIPTION\",\"name\":\"TEST\",\"organization_id\":\"$ORGANIZATION_ID\",\"tags\":[\"test\", \"step by step\"]}"
    ```
  The output of the API call returns a `json` output, similar to the example below where:
    - The first line starting with `id` displays the ID of the newly created Load Balancer.
    - The line starting with `ip_address` displays the load balanced IP.
    ```json no-copy
    {
      "id": "6208ec73-2b0e-4b60-b449-7f6bd72fd522",
      "name": "TEST",
      "description": "YOUR DESCRIPTION",
      "status": "pending",
      "Instances": [],
      "organization_id": "ORGANIZATION_ID",
      "ip": [
        {
          "id": "7906bc2b-00cd-4548-8e06-ebfdf1e850be",
          "ip_address": "51.159.11.11",
          "organization_id": "6208ec73-2f0a-8e06-9ea1-e53b4f625527",
          "lb_id": "6208ec73-2b0e-4b60-b449-7f6bd72fd522",
          "reverse": "",
          "region": "fr-par"
        }
      ],
      "tags": [
        "test",
        "step by step"
      ],
      "frontend_count": 0,
      "backend_count": 0,
      "region": "fr-par"
    }
    ```
2. Copy the `id` field of the response to use during the next steps. To simplify the use, save the ID to a variable, which will be used in the following steps.
	```json
	export LB_ID="REPLACE-BY-ID-OF-YOUR-LOAD-BALANCER"
	```
3. Create a new backend. This tutorial supposes that a web application is running on port `80` of the backend machines. Make sure to replace `REPLACE-BY-IP-OF-YOUR-SERVER1` and `REPLACE-BY-IP-OF-YOUR-SERVER2` with the IPs of the backend servers:
	```
	curl -s -X POST "https://api.scaleway.com/lb/v1/regions/$REGION/lbs/$LB_ID/backends" -H "accept: application/json" -H "X-Auth-Token: $SECRET_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-d "{\"forward_port\":80,\"forward_port_algorithm\":\"roundrobin\",\"forward_protocol\":\"tcp\",\"health_check\":{\"check_delay\":2000,\"check_max_retries\":3,\"check_timeout\":1000,\"port\":80,\"tcp_config\":{}},\"name\":\"main backend\",\"send_proxy_v2\":false,\"server_ip\":[\"<REPLACE-BY-IP-OF-YOUR-SERVER1>\", \"<REPLACE-BY-IP-OF-YOUR-SERVER2>\"]} | jq ."
	```

  A `json` output similar to the first request displays. 
4. Copy the value of the first line of the output, starting with id, and set it as a variable:
	```json
	export BACKEND_ID="<REPLACE-BY-ID-OF-YOUR-BACKEND>"
	```
5. Create the certificate by calling the [API endpoint](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/load-balancer/zoned-api/#path-certificate), after replacing `YOUR-CERTFICATE-NAME` with a friendly name for the certificate and `REPLACE-BY-YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME` with your domain name (i.e. `lb.example.com`):
	```
	curl -X POST "https://api.scaleway.com/lb/v1/regions/$REGION/lbs/$LB_ID/certificates" -H "accept: application/json" -H "X-Auth-Token: $SECRET_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"name\":\"<YOUR-CERTIFICATE-NAME>\",\"letsencrypt\":{\"common_name\":\"<REPLACE-BY-YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME>\"}}"
	```

  The certificate details are presented in the form of a `json` list. 
6. Copy the value of the first line of the list starting with `id` and set it as a variable:
	```json
	export CERT_ID="<REPLACE-BY-ID-OF-YOUR-CERTIFICATE>"
	```
7. Create a [new frontend](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/load-balancer/zoned-api/#path-frontends-create-a-frontend-in-a-given-load-balancer) by specifying the **IDs of the Load Balancer**, **an existing backend** and the **certificate**. Specify also the `inbound_port` (Port `443` for the default `HTTPS` port), on which the frontend will listen for incoming connections.
	```
	curl -X POST "https://api.scaleway.com/lb/v1/regions/$REGION/lbs/$LB_ID/frontends" -H "accept: application/json" -H "X-Auth-Token: $SECRET_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-d "{\"backend_id\":\"$BACKEND_ID\",\"inbound_port\":443,\"name\":\"main frontend\",\"timeout_client\":5000,\"certificate_id\": \"$CERT_ID\"}"
	```

The Load Balancer is now up, configured with a [Let's Encrypt SSL/TLS certificate](https://letsencrypt.org/), accepting `HTTPS` connections on port `443` and terminating the `HTTPS` sessions on the Load Balancer before connecting to the backends via a plain `HTTP` connection.

For more information about the configuration of a Load Balancer via the API, refer to the [API documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/load-balancer/zoned-api/#introduction).
