## Creating a project

You need your API's secret key and your Organization ID for the step below.

Open a terminal and type the following command to create a project:

```
curl -XPOST -H 'X-Auth-Token: your-secret-key' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"organization_id":"0a123456-7b8c-9d0e1-f234-5ghi6789j012","name":"test-project"}' https://api.scaleway.com/account/v2/projects
```
An output similar to the following displays:

```
{"id":"1bc9d87e-6543-2f2g-1hi0-1j234k45l6m7","name":"test-project","organization_id":"0a123456-7b8c-9d0e1-f234-5ghi6789j012","created_at":"2022-07-19T15:02:43.455727Z","updated_at":"2022-07-19T15:02:43.455727Z","description":""}%
