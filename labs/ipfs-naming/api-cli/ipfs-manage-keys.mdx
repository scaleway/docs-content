To manage your keys, we use [Kubo](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/command-line/), the official IPFS implementation in Golang.

## Export key using a Kubo client

To export your Kubo client key and convert it to base64 for import into our naming service, you can use the following sequence of commands:

1. Run the following CLI command to list the keys you own:
    ```
    ipfs key list
    ```
2. Run the following CLI command to export the key to a privkey.pem file:
    ```
    ipfs key export myKey -o privkey.pem
    ```

    <Message type="important">
        The key must be exported in `libp2p-protobuf-cleartext` format, which is the default.
    </Message>
3. Convert the file contents to base64 to import them into the naming service via the Scaleway CLI.
    ```
     cat privkey.pem | base64
    ```

## Import key to Kubo client

After exporting your key from our service, it will be provided to you in `base64` format. Follow these steps to import the key into your Kubo client.

1. Run the following CLI command to decode your `base64` key into a binary file:
    ```
    base64 -d myKeyFileBase64 > privkey.pem
    ```

2. Run the following CLI command to import your decoded key into your Kubo client:
    ```
    ipfs key import myKey privkey.pem
    ```
