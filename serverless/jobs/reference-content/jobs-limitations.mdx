## Default values for CPU and memory limits

When the job vCPU and/or memory are not provided by the client, these default values are automatically used:

| Resources | Default value  |
|-----------|----------------|
| CPU       | 1120 mvCPU     |
| Memory    | 2048 MB        |

## Architecture

Scaleway Serverless Jobs only supports `amd64` architecture for images.

For example, if you build an image using an ARM CPU, such as Apple Silicon, your image will be in the `arm64` architecture, and you will have an error message during deployment.

You must ensure that you build your image to target `amd64` architecture.

## Ports restrictions

In order to ensure the proper functioning of the product, we restrict the use of certain ports and environment variables.

* Blocked ports:
  * **25**: Due to potential abuse (spam), no outbound traffic is allowed through this port, except from Scaleway Transactional Email SMTP servers.
  * **465**: Due to potential abuse (spam), no outbound traffic is allowed through this port, except from Scaleway Transactional Email SMTP servers.
