The **customized error page** feature allows you to redirect users to a static website hosted on Scaleway Object Storage, in the case that none of your Load Balancer's backends are available to serve the requested content. This website could be a simple, single webpage or else something much more complex: you build it according to your own requirements.

If you do not configure a customized error page, and none of your backend servers are available, your users will instead see a standard HTTP error displayed in their browser, e.g. `503 Service Unavailable`.

Benefits of using this feature include:
- Displaying customized, branded and user-friendly error messages
- Providing links to support resources or contact information
- Providing information on service status or maintenance
- Redirecting to a mirrored site or skeleton site

You can set up a customized error page during creation of your Load Balancer, or at any point after creation.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created a bucket which is hosting a [bucket website](/storage/object/how-to/use-bucket-website/)

## How to create a static website for your customized error page

Having activated the customized error page feature on your Load Balancer, you must ensure that you have created a static website or webpage to display.
