Once your external domains have been created and validated, you can manage them from the Scaleway console.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Linked your domain](/network/domains-and-dns/how-to/add-external-domain/) with Scaleway Domains and DNS

1. Click **Domains and DNS** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu.
2. Click the **External domains** tab.
3. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the domain you want to manage.

The domain's **Overview** tab displays. This gives you an overview of the status of your domain, as well as a list of all name servers associated with it. At the bottom of the page, you can also delete your domain from Scaleway Domains and DNS.
