## General

### What is Clusters for Apache Kafka®?

Clusters for Apache Kafka® is Scaleway's product to provide a secure, fully-managed infrastructure for your Apache Kafka® deployments. With our clusters, you can create data pipelines and event-driven architectures that run natively on Apache Kafka®, without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. This product is currently in Private Beta.

### What limitations apply during the Private Beta?

Private Beta is aimed at providing an early version of a future product, to allow users to test and validate it during its development. The following limitations apply to Clusters for Apache Kafka® in its current Private Beta phase:

- Only selected users can test the product ([request an invitation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/betas/))
- Only one Kafka version is supported (TODO).
- Clusters can only be provisioned with either one or three nodes (brokers).
- Storage is fixed at 100 GB per node.
- Connectivity to the cluster is facilitated exclusively through Private Networks.
- Only one set of credentials (username and password) can be created per cluster.

We aim to improve and develop the product based on feedback received during the beta stage.

## Billing

### How am I billed for Clusters for Apache Kafka®?

Clusters for Apache Kafka® are free of charge during Private Beta, and you will not be billed.

### How will pricing work in the future?

We anticipate that future pricing will be based on TODO.
