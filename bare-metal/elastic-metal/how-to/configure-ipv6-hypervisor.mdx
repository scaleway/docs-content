When you install your server with a virtualization solution like Proxmox, you can create multiple virtual machines on the physical server and configure them to use flexible IPv6 addresses.

Below, you will find some examples for the configuration of the network interfaces on different distributions inside a virtual machine.

<Message type="tip">
  * The IPv6 gateway for your machines is learned by RA. You do not need to specify it in your configuration.
  * The DNS cache server (nameserver) may be different depending on the physical location of your server. Refer to our [network information documentation](/console/account/reference-content/scaleway-network-information/#dns-cache-servers/) to find the IPv6 addresses to use with your machine.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner/) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission/) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [Dedibox server](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/order-a-server/) with a hypervisor (Proxmox or ESXi) installed on it
- A [flexible IPv6](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/order-flexible-ip/)
- A [virtual MAC address](/dedibox-network/ip-failover/concepts/#virtual-mac-address/)


## Ubuntu 

Since the release of version 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) Ubuntu has switched to Netplan for the configuration of network interfaces. For older releases of the distribution, refer to the configuration for Debian.

1. Log into your virtual machine and open the network configuration file `/etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml` in a text editor of your choice, for example `nano`:
    ```sh
    sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
    ```
2. Create a network configuration as follows. Remember to replace `FLEXIBLE_IPv6` with your failover IP address: 
    ```yaml
    # This is the network config written by 'subiquity'
    network:
    ethernets:
        ens18:
        addresses:
        - FLEXIBLE_IPv6/64
        nameservers:
            addresses: [ "2001:bc8:1008:1::16" ]
            search: []
    version: 2
    ```
3. Save the file and exit the text editor.
4. Apply the new configuration:
    ```
    sudo netplan apply
    ```

## Debian

1. Log into the virtual machine and edit the file `/etc/network/interfaces/` with a text editor of your choice, for example, `nano`:
    ```sh
    nano /etc/network/interfaces
    ```
2. Configure the network interface as follows. Remember to replace `fail.over.ip.address` with your failover IP address:
    ```sh
    auto ens18
        iface ens18 inet6 static
        address FLEXIBLE_IPv6
        netmask 64
    ```
3. Save the file and exit the text editor.
4. Set the DNS server information by editing the file `/etc/resolv.conf`:
    ```
    nano /etc/resolv.conf
    ```
5. Set the DNS resolver by adding the following lines to the file. Then save it and exit the text editor:
    ```
    nameserver 2001:bc8:1008:1::16
    nameserver 2001:bc8:1008:1::14
    ```

    <Message typ="tip">
      These DNS resolvers are operated by Scaleway. You can also set your preferred alternative DNS resolvers in the file.

6. Activate the network on your virtual machine by running the following code:
    ```
    ifup ens18
    ```

## CentOS

1. Log into the virtual machine and edit the file `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0` with a text editor of your choice, for example, `nano`:
    ```sh
    nano /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
    ```
2. Configure the network interface as follows. Remember to replace `fail.over.ip.address` with your failover IP address and `virtual:mac:address` with the virtual MAC of the VM:
    ```
    DEVICE=ens18
    BOOTPROTO=none
    ONBOOT=yes
    USERCTL=no
    IPV6INIT=yes
    PEERDNS=yes
    TYPE=Ethernet
    NETMASK=64
    IPADDR=FLEXIBLE_IPv6
    DNS1=2001:bc8:1008:1::16
    DNS2=2001:bc8:1008:1::14
    ARP=yes
    HWADDR=virtual:mac:address
    ```
3. Save the file and close the text editor.
4. Run the following command to bring the network interface up:
    ```
    ifup eth0
    ```
