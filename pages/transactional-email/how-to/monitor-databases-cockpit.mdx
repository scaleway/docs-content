You can use Scaleway Cockpit to track TEM metrics and monitor email activity, detect potential deliverability issues, and check key indicators to track your domain's reputation.

This page explains how to get started with Scaleway Cockpit for viewing your Transactional Email metrics and logs.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Configured your domain(s) with Transactional Email](/transactional-email/how-to/configure-domain-with-transactional-email/)
- Added [SPF, DKIM](/transactional-email/how-to/add-spf-dkim-records-to-your-domain/), [MX](/transactional-email/how-to/add-mx-record-to-your-domain/) and [DMARC](/transactional-email/how-to/add-dmarc-record/) records to your domain(s)

## How to activate your Cockpit

Scaleway Cockpit is activated by default if you have created any [Scaleway resources integrated with Cockpit](/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-limitations/#product-integration-into-cockpit).

## How to access the Grafana dashboard

To view your TEM metrics, use the Grafana dashboard which is accessible from the Scaleway console:
  - First, you must create a user and their associated credentials (a username and password) for Grafana
  - Then, you can use these credentials to access the Grafana dashboard for all your Scaleway products, via the Scaleway console.

1. Create a Grafana user and retrieve their username and password by [following this procedure](/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/).

2. From the Scaleway console [Cockpit overview page](https://console.scaleway.com/cockpit/overview), click **Open dashboards** in the top right corner.

3. Enter your Grafana username and password to log in.

    You are directed to the Scaleway Cockpit dashboards homepage.

## How to view and understand your TEM metrics

1. Click **Open dashboards** on the top right from the Scaleway Cockpit dashboards homepage.
2. Click either **TEM Overview** or **TEM Overview**, depending on your engine of choice, on the left side menu.

    You are directed to the TEM Overview dashboard.

### Choosing metric parameters

At the top of the dashboard, you can configure the following parameters, that control which metrics are displayed:

- **Resource name** - Select a specific Database Instance to monitor.
- **Node** - Choose a specific node (main, replica, or Read Replica). In a High Availability (HA) cluster, both nodes might switch from main to replica and vice versa. So you might see two versions of the same node, as main and as replica. If you select main for a specific node, you will only see the node's activity when it was the main, and vice-versa.
- **Timeframe** - Get metrics from the last five minutes up to 31 days (free plan) and 365 days (premium plan).
