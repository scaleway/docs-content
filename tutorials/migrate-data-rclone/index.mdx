[Rclone](https://rclone.org) provides a modern alternative to [rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync). The tool communicates with any S3 compatible cloud storage provider as well as other storage platforms, and can be used to migrate data from one bucket to another, even if those buckets are in different regions.

</Message>

## Installing Rclone

1. Connect to your server as `root` via [SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).
2. Update the APT package cache and the software already installed on the Instance.
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
3. Download and install Rclone with the following sequence of commands:
    ```
    wget https://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-current-linux-amd64.zip
    apt install zip
    unzip rclone-current-linux-amd64.zip
    cd rclone*linux-amd64/
    mv rclone /usr/bin/
    ```

## Configuring Rclone

1. Begin rclone configuration with the following command:
    ```
    rclone config
    ```

    If you do not have any existing remotes, the following output displays:
    ```
    2021/01/18 16:03:28 NOTICE: Config file "/root/.config/rclone/rclone.conf" not found - using defaults
    No remotes found - make a new one
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    ```

    If you have previously configured rclone you may see a slightly different output. However, that does not affect the following steps.
2. Type `n` to make a new remote. You are then prompted to type a name - here we type `remote-sw-paris`:
    ```
    n/s/q> n
    name> remote-sw-paris
    ```

    The following output displays:

  If you want to be able to transfer data to or from a bucket in a different region to the one you just set up, repeat steps 1-14 again to set up a new remote in the required region. Simply enter the required region at steps 7 and 8. Similarly, you may wish to set up a new remote for a different Object Storage provider.

## Migrating data

There are two commands that can be used to migrate data from one backend to another.

- The `copy` command copies data from source to destination.
```
rclone copy --progress <SOURCE_BACKEND>:<SOURCE_PATH> <DEST_BACKEND>:<DEST_PATH>
```

For example, the following command copies data from a bucket named `my-first-bucket` in the `remote-sw-paris` remote backend that we previously set up, to another bucket named `my-second-bucket` in the same remote backend. The `--progress` flag allows us to follow the progress of the transfer:
```
rclone copy --progress remote-sw-paris:my-first-bucket remote-sw-paris:my-second-bucket
```

- The `sync` command copies data from one backend to another, but also deletes objects in the destination that are not present in the source:
```
rclone sync --progress <SOURCE_BACKEND>:<SOURCE_PATH> <DEST_BACKEND>:<DEST_PATH>
```

The following command copies data from a bucket named `my-first-bucket` in the `remote-sw-paris` remote backend that we previously set up, to another bucket named `my-third-bucket` in a different remote backend that we configured for the `nl-ams` region and named `remote-sw-ams`. It also deletes any data that present in `my-third-bucket` that isn't also present in `my-first-bucket`:
```
rclone sync --progress remote-sw-paris:my-first-bucket remote-sw-ams:my-third-bucket
```

<Message type="note">
  This migration may incur in costs from the Object Storage tool you are migrating **from** since they may or may not bill egress bandwidth.
</Message>

For further information, and to discover other commands available, refer to the official [RClone S3 Object Storage Documentation](https://rclone.org/s3/). 

## Transferring data to Scaleway Glacier

When you `copy` or `sync`, you can determine which storage class you wish to transfer your data as.

At Scaleway you can choose from two classes:

- `STANDARD`: The Standard class for any upload; suitable for on-demand content
  like streaming or CDN.
- `GLACIER`: Archived, long-term retention storage;

If the storage class is not specified, the data will be transferred as `STANDARD` by default.

To transfer data to Scaleway Glacier class, add `--s3-storage-class=GLACIER` to your command, as such:

```
rclone copy --progress --s3-storage-class=GLACIER <SOURCE_BACKEND>:<SOURCE_PATH> <DEST_BACKEND>:<DEST_PATH>
```

You can verify the storage class of the transferred data by accessing your bucket on the Scaleway console.
