Express is a lightweight Node.js framework designed to ease building applications and APIs.

In this tutorial you will learn how to configure your [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) application to run on Scaleway Serverless Container.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [Serverless Containers namespace](/serverless/containers/how-to/create-a-containers-namespace/)
- Installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on your computer

## Creating an Express.js application

To begin, we need to create a web server with Node.js and an Express.js framework.

1.  Create a new folder for the project:
    ```
    mkdir my_nodejs_project
    ```
2. Install the `express` library: 
    ```
    npm install express
    ```

    Two files are created during this step: `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. 
3. Create a `server.js` file with the following code. This creates a simple Web Server using Express.js:
    ```js
    const express = require('express');

    // Constants
    const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080;
    const HOST = '0.0.0.0';

    // App
    const app = express();
    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
      res.send('Hello World');
    });

    app.listen(PORT, HOST);
    console.log(`Running on http://${HOST}:${PORT}`);
    ```

## Configuring the Docker image

In order to Dockerize our simple web App, we will use the official Node.js image.

1. Create a Dockerfile using the following command: 
    ```
    touch Dockerfile
    ```
    <Message type="tip">
      A Dockerfile is a document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to create an image.
    </Message>
2. Open the Dockerfile in a text editor and specify the following actions:
    * Define the node version you want to use:

    ```dockerfile
    FROM node:14
    ```

    * Create a directory to store your application code:

    ```dockerfile
    # Create app directory
    WORKDIR /usr/src/app
    ```

    * Install the applications dependencies using the npm binary:

    ```dockerfile
    # Install app dependencies
    # A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
    COPY package*.json ./

    RUN npm install
    ```

    * Copy your code inside the Docker image:

    ```dockerfile
    # Bundle app source
    COPY . .
    ```

    * Your App binds to the port define in the environment variable PORT, define it and expose the port 8080

    ```dockerfile
    ENV PORT 8080
    EXPOSE 8080
    ```

    * Use CMD to run the node server.js command that will start your application
    ```dockerfile

    CMD [ "node", "server.js" ]
    ```

    The final Dockerfile should look like this example:

    ```dockerfile 
    FROM node:14

    # Create app directory
    WORKDIR /usr/src/app

    # Install app dependencies
    # A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
    COPY package*.json ./

    RUN npm install

    # Bundle app source
    COPY . .

    ENV PORT 8080
    EXPOSE 8080
    CMD [ "node", "server.js" ]
    ```

    To lighten your image, some folders and files need to be excluded from the image generation:
3. Create a `.dockerignore` file in the same directory as your Dockerfile:
    ```
    touch .dockerignore 
    ```
4. Open the `.dockerignore` file in a text editor and add the following content:
    ```
    node_modules
    npm-debug.log
    ```

## Deploying the application on Serverless Containers

1. Build your image using the following command: 
    ```sh
    docker build . -t <your application name>
    ```
2. [Push](/containers/container-registry/how-to/push-images/) the created image into the [Container Registry](/containers/container-registry/quickstart/) linked to your Containers namespace
    <Message type="tip">
      The registry name starts with `funcscw` + the namespace name.
    </Message>
3. Deploy the image using the Scaleway console.

## Conclusion

You have built, pushed and deployed your first web application using Node.js and Express Server on Scaleway Serverless Containers. For more information about the Containers product, refer to our [dedicated product documentation](/serverless/containers/quickstart/).
