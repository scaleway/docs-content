Scaleway [Elastic Metal](https://www.scaleway.com/en/elastic-metal/) allows you to order dedicated servers on-demand, similar to cloud Instances. These servers are ideal for large workloads, big data, and applications requiring enhanced security and dedicated resources.

If you ordered your server without a preinstalled operating system, you can install an OS once the Elastic Metal server is delivered to your account.

<Macro id="requirements" />
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An [Elastic Metal server](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/quickstart/#how-to-create-an-elastic-metal-server)

<Message type="tip">
  This procedure is not necessary if you preinstalled an OS on your Elastic Metal server during its creation.

1. Click **Elastic Metal** in the **Bare Metal** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Elastic Metal dashboard displays.
2. Click **Install** next to the server you want to install. The server installation wizard displays.
3. Select the operating system you want to install on the machine.
   <Message type="note">
      Elastic Metal servers are installed with a default partition layout. For custom partitioning, you can manually reinstall your server using [remote access](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/activate-remote-access/).
   </Message>
4. Add your [SSH key](/console/account/concepts/#ssh-key). If you have already [uploaded a key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/#how-to-upload-the-public-ssh-key-to-the-scaleway-interface), it will appear in the list of keys. Select the keys to grant access to the server by checking the corresponding boxes.
5. Click **Install server** to begin the installation process.
   <Message type="note">
      The OS installation can take up to one hour. You will be able to access the machine once the installation is complete.

To view more details about your server, click its name in the Elastic Metal servers list. This will display detailed information about the machine, including its IP address, labels, and description.
