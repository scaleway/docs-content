Public Gateways have a [public flexible IP address](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#flexible-ip) which makes the Public Gateway accessible over the internet. Internally at Scaleway, these IP addresses were originally implemented via a NAT (Network Address Translation) solution. We have now moved to a more efficient routed IP solution. 

Scaleway users were invited to manually move their Public Gateways from NAT to routed at a time that suited them. Between the 27th and 31st May 2024, all remaining Public Gateways will NAT IPs were then automatically moved to routed IPs.  

Moving to routed IP is purely a backend modification to the method Scaleway uses to map IP addresses to the physical hypervisors hosting your resources. It updates your current network interface for a new one, while keeping your attached IP address.

Having routed IPs ensures that when features such as IPv6 are released in the future, your gateway will be compatible. The move from NAT to routed IPs is part of Scaleway's overarching IP mobility project. Read our blog post for [full information](https://www.scaleway.com/en/blog/ip-mobility-removing-nat/).
