This page shows you how to change the [retention](/cockpit/concepts/#retention) period for your data sources.

<Message type="important">

 **Cockpit pricing plans were deprecated on January 1st 2025** <br /><br />

 The [retention](/cockpit/concepts/#retention) period previously set for your Scaleway and custom logs, metrics and traces remains the same. <br /><br />
 You can change the retention period for your metrics, logs, and traces for free during the retention period edition beta (starting January 1st 2025). <br /><br />

         - Reducing the retention period of a data source will permanently delete all observability data in that data source beyond the selected timeframe. This deletion is irreversible and takes effect a few minutes after the retention period is reduced, even if the retention period is later increased.
         - Find out about the [retention periods available for each data source type](/cockpit/concepts/#retention).
