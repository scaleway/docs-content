[Flexible IP addresses](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/concepts/#flexible-ip) are additional IP addresses, available for [Elastic Metal servers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/elastic-metal/). They allow you to move an IP from one server to another without changing your whole configuration. Flexible IPs can also be used as additional IP addresses to create virtual machines on your Elastic Metal server.

<Message type="important">
  Note that Scaleway offers flexible IPs for [Elastic Metal servers](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/concepts/#elastic-metal-server), [Instances](/compute/instances/concepts/#instance) and [Public Gateways](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#public-gateway). Each of these sets of flexible IPs is independent, and usable only with that product. Instance flexible IPs cannot be attached to Elastic Metal servers or Public Gateways, and vice versa.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)  
  - You have [configured your SSH key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key)
  - You have [created](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/create-server) and [installed](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/install-server) an Elastic Metal server

1. Click **Elastic Metal** in the **Bare Metal** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Elastic Metal dashboard displays.
2. Click the **Flexible IPs** tab at the top of the page.
3. Click **+ Order flexible IP**. The order dialog displays. Select if you want to order either:
    * A flexible IPv4 (a single IPv4 address (`/32`) that can be routed to any of your Elastic Metal servers)
    * A flexible IPv6 (a `/64` IPv6 subnet that can be routed to any of your Elastic Metal servers)
4. Optionally, you can enter a description and tags to facilitate the management of your flexible IPs. Tags allow you to filter IP addresses from the Scaleway console. Once done, confirm the order by clicking **Order a flexible IP**.

    The flexible IP is assigned to your account and displays in the list of your Elastic Metal flexible IPs.
