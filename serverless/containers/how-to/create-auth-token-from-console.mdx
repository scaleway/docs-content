This page shows you how to create and manage an authentication token from the console.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a containers namespace](/serverless/containers/how-to/create-a-containers-namespace)
- [Deployed a container](/serverless/containers/how-to/deploy-a-container-from-scaleway-container-registry/)

## Creating authentication tokens from the Scaleway console

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The Serverless Containers page displays.

2. Click the relevant containers namespace to see a list of containers in this namespace.

3. Click the name of the relevant container in the **Containers** tab. The container's details display.

4. Click the **Security** tab. A list of settings displays.

5. Click **Generate token** in the **Tokens** panel. A pop-up displays.

6. Enter the token description and set an expiration date for the token. Optionally, tick the box **No expiration date**, to have a token with unlimited validity. Then click **Generate token**.

7. Copy the token from the pop-up and store it in a safe environment.

    The token key will only be available for copy once. Make sure to store it securely before leaving the page.

## Using tokens

To use your token, you have to add the generated token to a `X-Auth-Token` header.

A **private** container observes this behavior:

* If a call is made without the `X-Auth-Token` header, the call is rejected (status code `403`)
* If the `X-Auth-Token` header is provided, the token is validated using a public key attached to the namespace.

For example, to execute a private container by providing a token using `curl`, run the following command:

```bash
curl -H "X-Auth-Token: <YOUR_CONTAINER_TOKEN>" <YOUR_CONTAINER_ENDPOINT>
```

## Deleting tokens

Tokens will expire by default on their given expiry date. You can delete them manually if they are no longer needed.

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The Serverless Containers page displays.

2. Click the relevant containers namespace to see a list of containers in this namespace.

3. Click the name of the relevant container in the **Containers** tab. The container's details display.

4. Click the **Security** tab. A list of settings displays.

5. Click <Icon name="delete" /> next to the token you want to delete in the **Tokens** panel. A pop-up displays.

6. Confirm by clicking **Delete token** to delete the token and to revoke access to the container.

    <Message type="important">

      This action is irreversible, and this token will not be able to access your container anymore.
