The [Scaleway Block Storage volume](https://www.scaleway.com/en/block-storage/) Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver is an implementation of the [CSI interface](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md) to provide a way to manage Scaleway block volumes through a container orchestration system, like Kubernetes. It is installed by default on every Kubernetes Kapsule and Kosmos cluster.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
- Your Scaleway Project or Organization ID
- [Created](/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/) a Kubernetes cluster running on Scaleway Instances (v1.21+)

    Refer to our video tutorial [Getting Started with Kubernetes Part 4 - Storage](/kubernetes/videos/) to view a visual presentation and step-by-step guidance of how to manage Block Storage volumes on Kubernetes with the Scaleway CSI.

## Verification of CSI driver status

To verify if the driver is running, use the following command:

```bash
kubectl get csidriver
```

The output of this command provides a quick status update on the CSI plugin within your Kubernetes cluster.

To identify your current CSI release version, navigate to the [Cockpit interface](/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards/), specifically the **Kubernetes Cluster - Overview** dashboard.

      * `sbs-5k` and `sbs-15k` are pre-configured storage classes designed to meet your IOPS requirements. You can achieve the equivalent of setting `iops:5k` in your custom class.
