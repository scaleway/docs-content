# What is Serverless Compute?

Serverless computing is a cloud computing model where the cloud providers manages the infrastructure and dynamically alocates computing resources as needed.

This means that you don't have to provision machines, manage a cluster or pay for servers. Your application code is executed on demand and you only pay for the compute time consumed by your software.

This approach enables greater scalability, flexibility and cost-effectiveness.

Key features:
* **Automatic scaling:** your application can scale up or down automatically based on demand
* **No server management:** you don't need to provision, maintain or manage servers
* **Pay as ou go:** you only pay for the compute time you consume, making it cost effective

Serverless is not limited to Serverless Function which is perfect to deploy small chunks of code, it can also directly deploy containers on Serverless Containers and Serverless Jobs.

# Why Serverless?

Serverless offers numerous advantages that can significantly enhance your development and operational efficiency:

* **Cost savings:** You only pay for the compute time your code uses, which can lead to significant cost reductions. No idle resources.
* **Scalability:** Automatically scale your applications to handle varying loads without manual intervention. It's perfect for seasonal traffic and viral apps.
* **Faster time to market:** Focus on writing code rather than managing infrastructure, accelerating your development cycles.
* **Reduced operational overhead:** Let the cloud provider handle server maintenance, updates, and scaling, freeing up your team to focus on innovation.
* **Eco friendly:**  Optimized resource usage reduces wasted energy.


# How to control costs of Serverless?

Serverless is inherently cost-transparent, tips to otpimize costs:
* Use efficient code and set timeouts
* Monitor usage with built-in observability
* Define a max-scale setting

Remember: Serverless eliminates upfront capital expenses and reduces operational costs giving you predictable, granular billing.

# Ready to go Serverless?

By adopting Serverless, you are choosing agility, innovation, and cost savings.
Whether you are a startup scaling rapidly or an enterprise modernizing legacy systems, Serverless lets you focus on what matters: delivering value to your users.

You can fully deploy your API on Serverless or use it to emporer and add automation to your infrastructure.
Serverless is excellent at handling traffic spikes, useful to offload regular servers on special events.

# Is my applicaiton a good fit for Serverless?
Most applications can benefit from Serverless! Here's when it shines:

* Event driven workloads: file processing, real time notification, IoT data streams.
* Microservies and APIs: Stateless, short-lived tasks (e.g., user authentication, payment processing, etc...)
* Sporadic traffic: Aps with variable usage (e.g., marketing campaigns, ticketing system).
* Rapid prototyping: Test ideas quickly without upfront infrastructure investment

# How secure are Serverless resources?

**Isolation:** Each container runs in a secure, isolated environment
**IAM integration:** Fine-grained access control via IAM, inject directly required redentials to Serverless ressources.

# How do I debug and monitor applications in a Serverless environment?

Scaleway provides full observability:

* **Logs and metrics:** Centralized logging and real-time metrics via Cockpit
* **Local debugging:** Test containers locally using the Serverless CLI and emulator
* **Error Reporting:** Automatic alerts for failed invocations or resource bottlenecks via Cockpit

# Will Serverless lock me into the ecosystem?
No. Scaleway Serverless is designed to minimize vendor lock-in.
We believe in empowering your freedom to choose, adapt, and evolve. Here is how we ensure flexibility:

## Container portability
- **Docker compatibility**: Your container images (built with Docker, Helm, or other tools) are portable. You can redeploy them elsewhereâ€”on-premises, on other clouds, or in hybrid environments.
- **No proprietary formats**: We don't modify your containers. What you build works anywhere.

## No proprietary lock-in
- **No forced dependencies**
- **Open APIs**: Manage Serverless Containers via REST APIs, Terraform, CLI, etc... no proprietary control required.
