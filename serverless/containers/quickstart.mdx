A container is a package of software that includes all dependencies: code, runtime, configuration, and system libraries so that the software can run on any host system. The Scaleway Containers platform provides you withÂ containerized stateless applications deployed in the cloud. You can use your favorite technologies such as Django or Ruby On Rails for your containers. We show you how to create a containers namespace, deploy a container, and delete it when you are done.

## How to create a Serverless Containers namespace

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The containers page displays.
2. Click **Create a namespace**. The containers namespace creation wizard displays.
3. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 
    - Enter a **name** and optionally a **description** for your namespace. The name must only contain alphanumeric characters.
    - Choose a **region**, which is the geographical location in which your namespace will be deployed.
    - Enter any **environment variables** required for your namespace. Environment variables configured in a namespace will be available in all containers/apps within the same namespace. For each environment variable, click **+Add** and enter the key/value pair.
    - Verify the **estimated cost**.
4. Click **Create a namespace** to finish.

    Your namespace is now created and you are taken to its **Containers** tab.

## How to deploy a container 

You can deploy a container either from the [Scaleway Container Registry](/containers/container-registry/quickstart/) or from any other public container registry (DockerHub, AWS Container registries, Gitlab container registry, etc.).

### Deploy from the Scaleway Container Registry

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The containers page displays.
2. Click the relevant containers namespace. 
3. Click **Deploy a Container**. The container creation wizard displays.
4. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 
    - Select the **Scaleway** Container Registry. 
    - Choose an **image** from your Container Registry. Select the required Container Registry Namespace from the dropdown list, and then select the container and tag.
    - Choose the **Port** your container is listening on. We recommend configuring your container to listen on the **PORT** environment variable.
    - Choose a **name** for your container, and optionally a **description**. The name must only contain alphanumeric characters.
    - Choose the **resources** to be allocated to your container at runtime. These define the performance characteristics of your container.
    - Set your **scaling** preferences, or leave them at default values. The Scaleway platform autoscales the number of available instances of your container to match the incoming load, depending on the settings you define here.
    - Define any **environment variables** you want to inject into your container. For each environment variable, click **+Add** and enter the key/value pair.
    - Add **secrets** for your container. Secrets are are environment variables which are injected into your function, but the values are not retained or displayed by Scaleway after initial validation.
    - Set the desired **privacy policy** for your container. This defines whether container invocation may be done anonymously (**public**) or only via an authentication mechanism provided by the [Scaleway API](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/containers/api/#authentication) (**private**). 
    - Optionally, use the **advanced options** to add [triggers](/serverless/containers/concepts/#trigger) to your container deployment. Adding triggers enables the container to handle events coming from sources other than an HTTP endpoint, such as CRON (time-based jobs), MQTT queues and more. 
    - Verify the **estimated cost**.
5. Click **Deploy a container** to finish.

### Deploy from an external registry

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The containers page displays.
2. Click the relevant containers namespace. 
3. Click **Deploy a Container**. The container creation wizard displays.
4. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 
    - Select the **External** container registry. 
    - Enter the public container **image URL** provided by the external registry.
    - Choose the **Port** your container is listening on. We recommend configuring your container to listen on the **PORT** environment variable.
    - Choose a **name** for your container, and optionally a **description**. The name must only contain alphanumeric characters.
    - Choose the **resources** to be allocated to your container at runtime. These define the performance characteristics of your container.
    - Set your **scaling** preferences, or leave them at default values. The Scaleway platform autoscales the number of available instances of your container to match the incoming load, depending on the settings you define here.
    - Define any **environment variables** you want to inject into your container. For each environment variable, click **+Add** and enter the key/value pair.
    - Add **secrets** for your container. Secrets are are environment variables which are injected into your function, but the values are not retained or displayed by Scaleway after initial validation.
    - Set the desired **privacy policy** for your container. This defines whether container invocation may be done anonymously (**public**) or only via an authentication mechanism provided by the [Scaleway API](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/containers/api/#authentication) (**private**). 
    - Optionally, use the **advanced options** to add [triggers](/serverless/containers/concepts/#trigger) to your container deployment. Adding triggers enables the container to handle events coming from sources other than an HTTP endpoint, such as CRON (time-based jobs), MQTT queues and more. 
    - Verify the **estimated cost**.
5. Click **Deploy a container** to finish.

## How to delete a container

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The containers page displays.
2. Click the relevant containers namespace.
2. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the container you want to delete, and select **Delete** from the drop down menu. 
3. Type **DELETE** in the pop-up that asks you to confirm the action, then click **Delete this container**.
