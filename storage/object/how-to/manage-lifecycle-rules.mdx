On the Scaleway console, you can use lifecycle rules to [manually](/storage/object/how-to/edit-storage-class/) or automatically change the storage class of your objects. These rules also allow users to set expiration dates for objects and their versions.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created an Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)
</Message>

## How to create a lifecycle rule
1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the name of your bucket. The list of your objects displays
3. Click **Lifecycle rules**.
4. Click **+ Create Lifecycle rule** to add a rule.
5. Enter a name for the rule.
6. Filter the objects you want the rule to be applied to by one or both of the following criteria:
    - [**Prefix**](/storage/object/concepts/#prefix): based on the object name and path. The defined rule will be applied to all objects with the same name [prefix](/storage/object/concepts/#prefix).
    - [**Tags**](/storage/object/concepts/#tags): comprised of a **key** and an associated **value**. These tags should be defined prior to rule creation, for either a bucket or an object. You can add one or more tags to your filter.

## How to configure transition rules

If you wish to change the [storage class](/storage/object/concepts/#storage-class) of two or more objects at a time, you can set up a transition rule that will automate the process.

1. Click <Icon name="toggle" /> **Change object class** to transfer the current version of the objects to a different storage class.
2. Select the class.
3. Click **-** or **+** to set a deadline after which your rule's current version will be transferred to another class. You can also directly type in the number of days you wish to set for your deadline.
4. Click **Next step** to proceed.
5. Check that all settings are correct and click **Create Lifecycle rule** to confirm.

    A list of the lifecycle rules is displayed.


## How to configure expiration rules

If you wish to delete an object after a set number of days, you can set up an expiration rule that will automate the process.

1. Click <Icon name="toggle" /> **Delete after expiration** to define when the current version of your objects will be deleted.
2. Click **-** or **+**, or type in the exact amount of days after the rule's creation you want the current version to be deleted.
3. Click **Next step** to proceed.
4. Check that all settings are correct and click **Create Lifecycle rule** to confirm.

    A list of the lifecycle rules is displayed.


## How to disable a lifecycle rule

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. A list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the name of your bucket.
3. Click the **Lifecycle rules** tab. A list of your rules is displayed.
4. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the rule name.
5. Click **Disable**. A confirmation window pops up.
6. Click **Disable lifecycle rule** if you wish to pursue the action.

    Once disabled, the lifecycle rule remains listed and can be enabled again. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Activate** to do so.

If you wish to permanently delete a rule, click  <Icon name="more" /> > **Delete**.
