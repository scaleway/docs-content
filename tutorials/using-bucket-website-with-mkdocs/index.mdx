This tutorial shows you how to create a documentation website using the Scaleway [Object Storage bucket website](/storage/object/concepts/#bucket-website) feature with MkDocs.

[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is a static site generator that allows users to generate a static website from a set of Markdown files. It is written in Python and uses Markdown for content creation.
We will use MkDocs to generate our website, and Material for MkDocs which is a documentation framework that extends MkDocs with additional features and customization options, to create visually appealing and user-friendly documentation websites.

Find out how to Set up MkDocs and configure your website in the first tab, then click the second tab to learn how to get a preview of your website and how to deploy it.

  <TabsTab label="Set up MkDocs and configure your website">
    1. Open the Visual Studio Code terminal and paste the following command to create a virtual environment to host your MkDocs content:
        ```
         python -m venv envname
        ```
    2. Activate the virtual environment:

        ```
         source envname/bin/activate
        ```
    3. Create a folder inside your virtual environment. This folder will contain your documentation directory.

        ```
         mkdir my-folder
        ```
        <Message type="note">
          Avoid naming your folder `docs` as this is already the default name for the MkDocs directory.
        </Message>
    4. Install MkDocs and the MkDocs Material theme in your virtual environment:
        ```
         pip install mkdocs
         pip install mkdocs-material
        ```
    5. Open the documentation folder you have created and enter the following command:
        ```
         mkdocs new .
        ```
        <Message type="note">
          This will create a YAML file named `mkdocs.yaml`, and a directory named `docs` containing an `index.md` file inside `my-folder`:
          - `docs` is the directory where you will need to create `.md` files containing your website's content.
          - `index.md` is your website's homepage.
          - `mkdocs.yml` is the file in which you can configure and customize your website.
        </Message>

      The architecture of your folder should look like the following:
          ```
            my-folder
            ├─ docs/
            │  └─ index.md
            └─ mkdocs.yml
          ```

    ## Configuring your website

       MkDocs provides many [configuration options](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/creating-your-site/#configuration) that you can use to create a beautiful website.


        Open your `mkdocs.yml` file. The following output should display. We will add to it as we go.

            ```
            site_name: My documentation website
            site_url: https://mydomain.org/mysite
            theme:
              name: material
            ```

    ### Configuring the color palette

        Material for MkDocs provides two default color schemes: `default`, which is the light mode, and `slate` which is the dark mode.

        Copy and paste the following code template under `theme` in the `mkdocs.yml` file to define your website's color scheme. Feel free to replace `default` with `slate` if you want to use the dark mode scheme.

          ```
            palette:
              - scheme: default
          ```
        Your file configuration should look like the following:

          ```
            site_name: My documentation website
            site_url: https://mydomain.org/mysite
            theme:
              name: material
              palette:
                - scheme: default
          ```

    #### Configuring a primary color

        You can use a specific primary color for your website's header, sidebar, and text links. Refer to the [MkDocs documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-colors/#primary-color)to find out which color options are available. You can also set [custom colors](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-colors/#custom-colors).

        Copy and paste the following code template under `palette` to set your primary color to black.

        ```
            primary: black
        ```

    #### Configuring an accent color

        You can use an accent color to emphasize elements such as buttons, scrollbars, and hovered links. Refer to the [MkDocs documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-colors/#accent-color) for a list of available colors.

        Copy and paste the following code template under `palette` to set your accent color to orange.

        ```
            accent: purple
        ```

    #### Configuring the color palette toggle

        You can give your users the choice to read your website in dark mode or light mode using a color palette toggle. Refer to the [documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-colors/#color-palette-toggle) for a list of available toggle options.

        Copy and paste the following code template under `scheme` to set a color palette toggle.

        ```
            # Palette toggle for light mode
              toggle:
                icon: material/toggle-switch
                name: Switch to dark mode

            # Palette toggle for dark mode
              toggle:
                icon: material/toggle-switch-off-outline
                name: Switch to light mode
        ```

        This is what your `mkdocs.yml` file should look like:

        ```
          site_name: My documentation website
          site_url: https://mydomain.org/mysite
          theme:
            name: material
            palette:
              # Palette toggle for light mode
              - scheme: default
                primary: black
                # Primary defines the primary color of the theme.
                accent: purple
                # Accent specifies the accent color of the theme.
                toggle:
                # toggle specifies the icon and name for toggling between light and dark modes.
                  icon: material/toggle-switch
                  name: Switch to dark mode

              # Palette toggle for dark mode
              - scheme: slate
                primary: white
                # primary defines the primary color of the theme.
                accent: deep purple
                # accent specifies the accent color of the theme.
                toggle:
                # toggle specifies the icon and name for toggling between light and dark modes.
                  icon: material/toggle-switch-off-outline
                  name: Switch to light mode
        ```

    ### Configuring fonts

        Material for MkDocs integrates with [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) but you can also add custom fonts if you prefer.

        Copy and paste the following code template to use the `Roboto` font.

        ```
          font:
            text: Roboto
        ```

        Refer to the [documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-fonts/#changing-the-fonts) to further configure your website's font styles.

        Your `mkdocs.yml` file should look like the following:

          ```
            site_name: My documentation website
            site_url: https://mydomain.org/mysite
            theme:
              name: material
              palette:
                # Palette toggle for light mode
                - scheme: default
                  primary: black
                  # Primary defines the primary color of the theme.
                  accent: purple
                  # Accent specifies the accent color of the theme.
                  toggle:
                  # toggle specifies the icon and name for toggling between light and dark modes.
                    icon: material/toggle-switch
                    name: Switch to dark mode

                # Palette toggle for dark mode
                - scheme: slate
                  primary: white
                  # primary defines the primary color of the theme.
                  accent: deep purple
                  # accent specifies the accent color of the theme.
                  toggle:
                  # toggle specifies the icon and name for toggling between light and dark modes.
                    icon: material/toggle-switch-off-outline
                    name: Switch to light mode
              font:
                text: Roboto
          ```

    ### Configuring navigation

        MkDocs provides multiple ways to configure your website's navigation depending on the amount of content your website contains. Find out [all available configurations for navigation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-navigation/) on the MkDocs website.

        Set up the navigation structure of your website using the code sample below. This configuration allows you to organize your navigation menu as you wish.

        ```
        nav:
        # Defines the navigation structure of the website, linking to the corresponding markdown files.
          - Welcome to my documentation website: index.md
          - My documentation website's FAQ: faq.md
          - Understanding a concept in my documentation website: understanding-concept.md
          - How to perform action one: perform-action-one.md
          - How to perform action two: perform-action-two.md
          - How to perform action three: perform-action-three.md
        ```

    ### Configuring admonitions

        You can use admonitions to add side content to your documentation or make parts you want your users to notice stand out more. Refer to the [documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/?h=admonitions#admonition-icons) to see available admonition icons.

    #### Enabling admonitions

        Copy and paste the following code template to enable admonitions, make them collapsible, and nest content inside them.

          ```
          markdown_extensions:
            - admonition
            - pymdownx.details
            - pymdownx.superfences
          ```
    #### Adding admonition icons

        Copy and paste the following code template to use Octicons admonition icons. You can also use the [FontAwesome admonition icons](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/?h=admonitions#admonition-icons-fontawesome).

        ```
          icon:
            admonition:
              note: octicons/tag-16
              abstract: octicons/checklist-16
              info: octicons/info-16
              tip: octicons/squirrel-16
              success: octicons/check-16
              question: octicons/question-16
              warning: octicons/alert-16
              failure: octicons/x-circle-16
              danger: octicons/zap-16
              bug: octicons/bug-16
              example: octicons/beaker-16
              quote: octicons/quote-16
        ```

    #### Using admonitions

        The example below shows you the syntax you need to use in your files for admonitions. You can replace `info` with any of the admonitions you have added in the previous section (`abstract`, `note`, `tip`, `success`, `question`, `warning`, `failure`, `danger`, `bug`, `example`, and `quote`).

        ```
        !!! info

            I am an information admonition. You can use me to give additional information to your user.
        ```

        You can add a custom title inside the admonition box like in the example below.

        ```
        !!! info "Information about the admonition box"

            I am an information admonition. You can use me to give additional information to your user.
        ```

        If you want your admonition box to be collapsible, you can use the code below. The user will only see the box without its content.

        ```
        ??? info

            I am an information admonition. You can use me to give additional information to your user.
        ```

        Find out more about admonitions on the [MkDocs website](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/?h=admonitions#configuration).

    ### Additional configuration

        You can add the following additional configuration options in your `mkdocs.yml` file. The `features` component allows you to use various features of the Material theme.
          ```
          features:
            - content.code.copy
            # Adds a copy button to code blocks.
            - navigation.sections
            # Enables section-based navigation.
            - navigation.path
            # Shows the navigation path (breadcrumbs).
            - navigation.top
            # Adds a "back to top" button.
            - search.suggest
            # Enables search suggestions.
          ```
        Add the `plugins` component to define the MkDocs plugins you want to enable on your website. The `search` plugin allows you to add the search functionality and the `glightbox` plugin allows you to add images and videos.
          ```
          plugins:
            # Lists the MkDocs plugins enabled for the site.
            - search
            # Adds search functionality.
            - glightbox
            # Adds lightbox functionality for images and videos.
          ```
        Add the copyright notice for your website.
          ```
          copyright: >
            Copyright &copy; 2016 - 2024 Martin Donath
          ```
    ## Downloading the mkdocs file template

        If you have only added the elements shown in the sections above, you can download the `mkdcos.yml` below.

          <a href="/tutorials/using-bucket-website-with-mkdocs/mkdocs-example.yml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" download="mkdocs-example.yml"> Download the mkdocs file </a>

</TabsTab>
  <TabsTab label="Preview and deploy your MkDocs website">

      Once your website's content is ready and configured, you can preview it to make sure that everything displays properly.

      ## Previewing and generating a static website

      1. Open the folder containing your `docs` directory in Visual Studio Code. The one we have created in this tutorial is named `my-folder`.
      2. Open the Visual Studio Code terminal and paste the following command:
          ```
          mkdocs serve
          ```
      3. Copy the localhost link that displays in the output into your browser. Your website should display.
      4. Check that everything on your website displays correctly and ensure that there are no broken links.
      5. Run the following command in your terminal to generate your folder's content into a static website:
          ```
          mkdocs build
          ```
          <Message type="note">
           When you run the `mkdocs build` command, MkDocs processes your markdown files and other configurations specified in your `mkdocs.yml` file and outputs a complete static site in a directory named `site` by default.
          </Message>

      ## Deploying your website

      1. [Create an Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/) from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/).
      2. [Enable](/storage/object/how-to/use-bucket-website/) the bucket website feature on your bucket.
      3. Click your bucket, then the **Bucket settings** tab.
      4. Scroll down to the **Bucket website** section and enter the names of your **index** and **error** documents and save your changes. By default, your index file is named `index.html`, and your error file is named `404.html`.
      5. Scroll back up and click the **Files** tab.
      6. On your local computer, open the `site` folder generated in the previous steps.
      7. Select all the files and folders inside your `site` folder and drag and drop them inside your bucket.
      8. Select a storage class when prompted and click **Validate storage class** to confirm. Your file architecture should look like the following.
         <Lightbox src="scaleway-mkdocs-files-in-bucket.webp" alt="File architecture showing the index and error files and folders containing the website content at the root of the bucket." />
      9. Once the transfer of your files is complete, cick the **Bucket settings** tab and scroll down to the **Bucket website** section.
      10. Retrieve the URL of your website under **Website URL**.
