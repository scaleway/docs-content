Clusters using the Kubernetes 1.24 version will be upgraded to Kubernetes 1.25 after May 15th, 2024.
Scaleway will change the CNI configuration to `none` for clusters still running unsupported CNIs (Flannel, Weave).
Find more details in our [version support policy](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/containers/kubernetes/reference-content/version-support-policy/#supported-container-network-interfaces-cni).
