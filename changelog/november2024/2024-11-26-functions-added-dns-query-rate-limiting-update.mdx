To ensure platform stability and performance, we've implemented a rate limit of 20 DNS queries per second for **full DNS resolutions** Function instance. 

This rate limit **only applies** to queries that require a full DNS resolution, and is enforced independently for each Function instance. This rate limit is set at a level that is well above typical usage, so most users should not be impacted. If you do encounter any issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team for assistance.
