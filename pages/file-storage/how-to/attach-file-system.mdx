This page explains how to attach a file system to one or several Instances. File systems can only be attached to Instances within the same [region](/file-storage/concepts/#region).

import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a file system](/file-storage/how-to/create-file-system/)
- [Created at least one POP2 Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/)

## How to attach a file system using the Scaleway console

1. Click **File Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. A list of your file systems displays.

2. Click the name of the file system you want to attach. The **Overview** page displays.

3. Open the **Attached Instance(s)**. A list of currently attached Instances displays.

4. Click **Attach an Instance**. A pop-up displays.

5. Select one Instance or more from the drop-down list, then click **Attach** to confirm.

Your file system is now attached to the selected Instance(s) and can now be [mounted](/file-storage/how-to/mount-file-system/) to a Scaleway Instance.

## How to attach a file system using the API

The Scaleway API allows you to create and manage all your resources programmatically.

<Message type="note">
To attach a file system to an Instance, you must use the [Instance API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instances/#path-instances-attach-a-filesystem-volume-to-an-instance).
</Message>

1. Make sure you have [authenticated and performed your first request](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/#quickstart-first-request) with the Scaleway API.

2. Run the cURL request below to attach your file system to the desired Instance. Do not forget to replace the placeholders with the appropriate values.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST 'https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/<region>/servers/<instance-id>/attach-filesystem' \
      -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"filesystem_id": "<my-fs-id>"}'
    ```

Refer to the [Scaleway API documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instances/#path-instances-attach-a-filesystem-volume-to-an-instance) for more information on the different parameters.

## How to attach a file system using the CLI

Scaleway CLI is a tool to help you pilot your Scaleway infrastructure directly from your terminal.

<Message type="note">
To attach a file system to an Instance, you must use the [Instance CLI](https://cli.scaleway.com/instance/#attach-a-filesystem-volume-to-an-instance).
</Message>

1. Make sure you have [installed and configured the Scaleway CLI](/scaleway-cli/quickstart/).

2. Run the command below to attach your file system to the desired Instance. Do not forget to replace the placeholders with the appropriate values.

    ```bash
    scw instance server attach-filesystem server-id=<instance_id> filesystem-id=<filesystem_id> zone=<availability_zone>
    ```

Refer to the [Scaleway CLI documentation](https://cli.scaleway.com/instance/#attach-a-filesystem-volume-to-an-instance) for more information on the different parameters.
