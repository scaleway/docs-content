## GRE tunnel - Overview

A GRE tunnel allows you to connect [Scaleway Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/) with [Scaleway Dedibox dedicated servers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/) and vice versa to exchange files over a virtual network connection that passes through the public Internet.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-gre-private-tunnel.webp" width="800" alt="" />

The [Generic Routing Encapsultion (GRE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_Routing_Encapsulation) protocol is designed as a tunneling tool in order to carry any [OSI Layer 3 protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer) over an IP network. It creates a point-to-point connection like a virtual Private Network (VPN) but without adding lots of latency or overhead.

</Message>

## Setting up the tunnel on a Scaleway Instance

1. Connect to the Cloud Instance via SSH:
    ```
    ssh root@your-instance-ip
    ```
2. Create a new file called `configure-tunnel.sh`:
    ```
    touch /opt/configure-tunnel.sh
    ```
3. Open the file in a text editor and copy the following code into it (ensure that you relplace the IP as stated):
    ```
    nano /opt/configure-tunnel.sh
    ```

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    REMOTE_IP="123.123.123.123" #Change this value to the public IP address of the Instance
    LOCAL_IP=`scw-metadata | grep "PRIVATE_IP=" | grep -oE '[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+'`

    ip tunnel add tun1 mode gre remote $REMOTE_IP local $LOCAL_IP ttl 255
    ip addr add 192.168.0.1 dev tun1
    ip link set tun1 up
    ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 dev tun1
    echo "Tunnel configured."
    ```
4. Save the file, exit the text editor and make it executable:
    ```
    chmod +x /opt/configure-tunnel.sh
    ```
5. Run the script:
    ```
    /opt/configure-tunnel.sh
    ```

### Setting up the tunnel on a Dedibox Server

1. Connect to the Dedibox dedicated server via SSH:
    ```
    ssh username@your-server-ip
    ```
2. Create a new file called `configure-tunnel.sh`:
    ```
    sudo touch /opt/configure-tunnel.sh
    ```
3. Open the file in a text editor and copy the following code into it (ensure that you relplace the IPs as stated):
    ```
    sudo nano /opt/configure-tunnel.sh
    ```

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    REMOTE_IP="123.123.123.123" #Change this value to the public IP address of the Scaleway Cloud Instance
    LOCAL_IP="123.123.123.123" #Change this value to the public IP address of the Dedibox dedicated server

    ip tunnel add tun1 mode gre remote $REMOTE_IP local $LOCAL_IP ttl 255
    ip addr add 192.168.1.1 dev tun1
    ip link set tun1 up
    ip route add 192.168.0.0/24 dev tun1
    echo "Tunnel configured."
    ```
4. Save the file, exit the text editor and make it executable:
    ```
    sudo chmod +x /opt/configure-tunnel.sh
    ```
5. Run the script:
    ```
    sudo /opt/configure-tunnel.sh
    ```

### Testing the tunnel

1. Run a first test by pinging the other endpoint to see if the tunnel is working:
    ```
    username@dedibox:~# ping 192.168.0.1
    PING 192.168.0.1 (192.168.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.854 ms
    64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=1.67 ms
    64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.854 ms
    64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.651 ms
    --- 192.168.0.1 ping statistics ---
    4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 2999ms
    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.651/1.007/1.670/0.392 ms
    ```

    ```
    root@scw-instance:~# ping 192.168.1.1
    PING 192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1.22 ms
    64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=1.01 ms
    64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=1.17 ms
    64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=1.10 ms
    --- 192.168.1.1 ping statistics ---
    4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3004ms
    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.011/1.130/1.226/0.084 ms
    ```
2. Install a [web server](/tutorials/installation-lemp-ubuntu-bionic/) on the Dedibox:
    ```
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install nginx -y
    ```
3. Enter the directory that is used to serve websites:
    ```
    cd /var/www/html
    ```
4. Download a [test file](http://ping.online.net/) into the `/var/www/html` directory:
    ```
    sudo wget http://ping.online.net/1000Mo.dat
    ```
5. Install [curl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) on the Instance:
    ```
    apt update && apt install curl -y
    ```
6. Run a bandwidth test with curl:
    ```
    root@scw-instance:~# curl -4 -o /dev/null http://192.168.1.1/1000Mo.dat
      % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                    Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
    100  953M  100  953M    0     0  97.8M      0  0:00:09  0:00:09 --:--:-- 67.0M
    ```

As you can see in the example above, the tunnel creates very low overhead and the bandwidth available for the Instance can be used.

<Message type="tip">
  For latency reasons and to avoid IP conflicts, we do not recommend that you create tunnels between different regions (e.g. between Paris and Amsterdam).

## Configuring the automatic start of the tunnel on system boot

<Message type="important"> 
  These steps have to be executed on both machines. You may need to use `sudo` for the Dedibox commands.
</Message>

1. Create a [`systemd`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) script in the directory `/etc/systemd/system`, called `configure-tunnel.service`, and open it in a text editor:
    ```
    nano /etc/systemd/system/configure-tunnel.service
    ```
2. Copy/paste the following content into the file:
    ```
    [Unit]
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/opt/configure-tunnel.sh

    [Install]
    WantedBy=default.target
    ```
3. Save the file and exit the text editor.
4. Set the file permissions, reload the `systemd` daemon and enable the newly created service:
    ```
    chmod 664 /etc/systemd/system/configure-tunnel.service
    systemctl daemon-reload
    systemctl enable configure-tunnel.service
    ```

    On the next reboot `systemd` will run the script during the boot process to automatically configure the tunnel.

### Going further

Scaleway provides a wide range of [Dedibox dedicated servers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/), with options such as Private Network, RPN-SAN, Backup, Monitoring.

You can use the virtual network you just set up to communicate between your Scaleway [Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/), [Elastic Metal servers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/elastic-metal/) and your [Dedibox dedicated servers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/) over a virtual network connection. This can be useful to configure services like databases that are not available on the public network and use the virtual connection to communicate between them.
