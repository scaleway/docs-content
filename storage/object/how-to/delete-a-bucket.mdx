<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created an Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)
</Message>

When you delete a bucket, every object stored inside it is deleted as well.

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the name of your selected bucket in the buckets list.

3. Click the **Bucket settings** tab.

4. Scroll to the end of the page and click **Delete bucket**.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-delete-bucket.webp" alt="" />

    A pop-up appears warning that:
    <Message type="important">
      Every object stored inside this bucket will be lost, and another customer will be allowed to reuse the name of this bucket. The deletion of your bucket will be triggered today at 11.59pm UTC.
    </Message>
5. If you understand and agree to the conditions, type **DELETE** in the box and click **Delete bucket**.

Alternatively, you can delete a bucket just by clicking the <Icon name="more" /> icon and then **Delete** in your bucket list.

Once the bucket is successfully deleted, it disappears from your bucket list.
  <Message type="note">
    For operational reasons you have to wait 24h before creating a bucket with the same name as the one you have just deleted.
