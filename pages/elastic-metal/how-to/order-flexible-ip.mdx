[Flexible IP addresses for Elastic Metal servers](/elastic-metal/concepts/#flexible-ip) are additional IP addresses available for [Elastic Metal servers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/elastic-metal/). 
They allow you to move an IP from one server to another without changing your entire configuration. Flexible IPs can also be used as additional IP addresses to create virtual machines on your Elastic Metal server.

<Message type="important">
  Scaleway offers flexible IPs for [Elastic Metal servers](/elastic-metal/concepts/#elastic-metal-server), [Instances](/instances/concepts/#instance), and [Public Gateways](/public-gateways/concepts/#public-gateway). Each set of flexible IPs is independent and can only be used with its respective product. Instance flexible IPs cannot be attached to Elastic Metal servers or Public Gateways, and vice versa.

<Requirements />
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An [installed Elastic Metal server](/elastic-metal/quickstart/#how-to-create-an-elastic-metal-server)

1. Click **Elastic Metal** in the **Bare Metal** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Elastic Metal dashboard displays.
2. Click the **Flexible IPs** tab at the top of the page to display the flexible IP configuration page.
3. Click **+ Order flexible IP**. The order dialog displays.
   - Select either:
     - A flexible IPv4 (a single IPv4 address (`/32`) that can be routed to any of your Elastic Metal servers in the same Availability Zone)
     - A flexible IPv6 (a `/64` IPv6 subnet that can be routed to any of your Elastic Metal servers in the same Availability Zone)
4. Optionally, enter a description and tags to facilitate the management of your flexible IPs. Tags allow you to filter IP addresses in the Scaleway console.
5. Click **Order a flexible IP** to confirm.

The flexible IP will be assigned to your account and will appear in the list of your Elastic Metal flexible IPs.
