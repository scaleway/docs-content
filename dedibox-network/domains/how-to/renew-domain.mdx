When you buy a domain name, you can use it for the period of time you registered it for, which is typically from one to ten years. When this period is nearing its end, you must renew your domain if you wish to keep using it.

      You can also choose to activate automatic renewal of your web hosting and domain names. To do so, check the **Activate automatic renewal** box on the Summary page. Your services automatically renew 62 days before their expiry dates. As such, automatic renewal can only be activated 62 days prior to the exipration date of the service.
