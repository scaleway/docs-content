We are pleased to introduce the new beta version of the Billing API v2.

Scaleway's Billing API gives you an overview of your cloud consumption and allows you to monitor expenses.

What's New?

- Monthly Consumption History -  access the complete history of your monthly consumption. Until now, only data from the current month was available.

- Granularity of Costs by Project, Product Category, and Month - we have introduced increased granularity, allowing you to view costs based on the project, product category, and month.

Refer to the [Billing API documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/billing/) for more information.
