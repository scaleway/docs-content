This page explains how to mount a file system to one or several Scaleway Instances.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a file system](/file-system/how-to/create-file-system/)
- [Attached](/file-storage/how-to/attach-file-system/) a file system to one or several Instances

1. Click **File Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. A list of your file systems displays.

2. Click the name of the file system you want to mount. The **Overview** page displays.

3. From the **Mount** section of the **Overview** page, copy the mounting command:

    ```sh
    mount -t virtiofs <file_system_id> /mnt
    ```

4. Open a terminal and [connect via SSH to the Instances](/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/) you have [attached to your file system](/file-storage/how-to/attach-file-system/).

5. Create a dedicated directory at the desired location (e.g. `/mnt/my_fs`) to use as a mount point.

5. Run the previously copied mount command to mount your file system. Make sure to specify the appropriate mount point:

    ```sh
    mount -t virtiofs <file_system_id> /mnt/my_fs
    ```

    <Message type="important">
    For safety reasons, we do not recommend mounting your file system directly to the `/mnt` directory, but rather to a dedicated sub-folder (such as `/mnt/my_fs`).
    </Message>

6. Run the following command to display the file systems of your Instance:

    ```sh
    df -h
    ```

    A list of your file systems displays, containing the one you just mounted:

    ```sh
    Filesystem                            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    tmpfs                                 794M  992K  793M   1% /run
    /dev/sda1                             8.0G  2.1G  6.0G  26% /
    /dev/sda2                             881M   61M  758M   8% /boot
    2933ea63-example-file-system-c05fe2    94G     0   94G   0% /mnt/my_fs

Your file system is now mounted and accessible from the specified mount point in your Instance.
