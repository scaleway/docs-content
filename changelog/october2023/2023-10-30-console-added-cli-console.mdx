New feature: Our integrated console CLI works with WebAssembly and uses your console credentials to offer you a seamless CLI experience without installing anything on your machine. Benefit from enhanced output formatting and discover a new way to manage your Scaleway resources. You can also install it natively on your local machine, as we support Windows, macOS, and Linux.
