## Rocket.Chat - Overview

[Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat) is a free and open source team chat software solution. It provides features like audio and video conferencing, guest access, screen sharing, file sharing, LiveChat, LDAP Group Sync, two-factor authentication (2FA), E2E encryption, SSO, and more. The tool uses [MongoDB](/tutorials/mongodb-ubuntu-1604/) as database and the JavaScript runtime [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

</Message>

## Preparing the Instance

1. Update the APT package cache and the software already installed on the Instance.
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
2. Add the key used by apt to install the official MongoDB packages:
    ```
    wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.4.asc | sudo apt-key add -
    ```
3. Create an apt sources list by running the following command:
    ```
    echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu focal/mongodb-org/4.4 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.4.list
    ```
4. Prepare the installation of Node.js.
    ```
    sudo apt-get -y update && sudo apt-get install -y curl && curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo bash -
    ```
5. Install MongoDB, Node.js, [graphicsmagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/) and build tools.
    ```
    sudo apt-get install -y build-essential mongodb-org nodejs graphicsmagick
    ```
6. Install [inherits](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inherits) via npm, the package manager of Node.js.
    ```
    sudo npm install -g inherits n
    ```
7. Create a symbolic link for the node binary file.
    ```
    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/node /usr/local/bin/node
    ```

## Installing Rocket.Chat

1. Download the latest version of Rocket.Chat:
    ```
    curl -L https://releases.rocket.chat/latest/download -o /tmp/rocket.chat.tgz
    ```
2. Extract the downloaded file:
    ```
    tar -xzf /tmp/rocket.chat.tgz -C /tmp
    ```
3. Launch the installation of the application:
    ```
    cd /tmp/bundle/programs/server && npm install
    ```
4. Move the application to its final destination:
    ```
    mv /tmp/bundle /opt/Rocket.Chat
    ```

## Configuring the Rocket.Chat Service

1. Create a user under which the application will run.
    ```
    useradd -M rocketchat && usermod -L rocketchat
    ```
2. Set the ownership and permissions of the application.
    ```
    chown -R rocketchat:rocketchat /opt/Rocket.Chat
    ```
3. Create the `lib/systemd/system/rocketchat.service` file and open it in your favorite text editor. Copy the following content to create a service file for Rocket.chat:
    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=Rocket.Chat Server
    After=network.target remote-fs.target nss-lookup.target nginx.target mongod.target
    [Service]
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/node /opt/Rocket.Chat/main.js
    StandardOutput=syslog
    StandardError=syslog
    SyslogIdentifier=rocketchat
    User=rocketchat
    Environment=MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/rocketchat ROOT_URL=http://rocketchat.example.com/ MONGO_OPLOG_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/local?replSet=rs01 PORT=3000
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    <Message type="important">
      Replace `rocketchat.example.com` with the domain for your Rocket.Chat Instance.
    </Message>

## Configuring a MongoDB replica set

We recommend you to use the [MongoDB replica set](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/replication/) to improve Rocket.Chat's performance with Meteor Oplog tailing.

1. Run the following code to add a replica set to your MongoDB configuration:
    ```
    echo -e "replication:\n  replSetName: \"rs01\"" | tee -a /etc/mongod.conf
    ```
2. Enable and start the MongoDB service.
    ```
    systemctl enable mongod.service && systemctl start mongod.service
    ```
3. Connect to the MongoDB shell and initiate the replica set with `rs.initiate()`.
    ```
    mongo
    > rs.initiate()
    ```

    An output like the following appears:

    ```
    {
      "info2" : "no configuration specified. Using a default configuration for the set",
      "me" : "127.0.0.1:27017",
      "ok" : 1,
      "operationTime" : Timestamp(1548866987, 1),
      "$clusterTime" : {
        "clusterTime" : Timestamp(1548866987, 1),
        "signature" : {
          "hash" : BinData(0,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA="),
          "keyId" : NumberLong(0)
        }
      }
    }
    rs01:SECONDARY>
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      Note the `"ok”` value has to be 1. Any other value, means something is wrong.
    </Message>
4. Press Enter on your keyboard. The following output indicates that the replica set is being used:
    ```
    rs01:PRIMARY>
    ```
5. Leave the MongoDB shell.
    ```
    rs01:PRIMARY> exit
    bye
    ```

## Configuring an Nginx reverse proxy

Rocket.Chat functions as a server on its own, but adding an [Nginx Reverse Proxy](https://www.scaleway.com/docs/how-to-configure-nginx-reverse-proxy/) adds a layer of security, advanced load balancing and acceleration features that the application does not provide by itself.

1. Install Nginx:
    ```
    apt install nginx
    ```
2. Create and open the `/etc/nginx/sites-available/rocketchat.example.com` file and paste the following content into it to create a proxy server block for Rocket.Chat:
    ```
    # Upstreams
    upstream backend {
        server 127.0.0.1:3000;
    }

    # Proxy Server
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name rocketchat.example.com;

        # You can increase the limit if your need to.
        client_max_body_size 200M;

        error_log /var/log/nginx/rocketchat.access.log;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend/;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
            proxy_set_header Host $http_host;

            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forward-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forward-Proto http;
            proxy_set_header X-Nginx-Proxy true;

            proxy_redirect off;
        }
    }
    ```

    <Message type="important">
      Replace `rocketchat.example.com` with the domain name under which your rocket chat Instance will be available.
    </Message>
3. Create a symbolic link to activate the proxy in Nginx:
    ```
    ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/rocketchat.example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/rocketchat.example.com
    ```
4. Test the configuration for syntax errors. 
    ```
    nginx -t
    ```

    If the syntax is correct you see an output like the following:

    ```
    nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
    nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
    ```
5. Install Certbot to generate a [Let's Encrypt SSL certificate](https://letsencrypt.org/) to encrypt the connection to your Rocket.Chat Instance:
    ```
    apt install software-properties-common
    add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
    apt update
    apt-get install python3-certbot-nginx
    ```
6. Run Certbot to request a certificate and to make the required changes to the Nginx configuration:
    ```
    certbot --nginx
    ```

    Certbot will ask you several questions and you should see an output like the following when you have completed the generation of the certificate:

    ```

    ```
    systemctl enable rocketchat.service && systemctl start rocketchat.service
    ```
2. Restart the Nginx web proxy.
    ```
    systemctl restart nginx.service
    ```
3. Open your web browser and type your domain name, for example: `https://rocketchat.example.com/`. The Rocket.Chat setup wizard appears in your browser.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-rocketchat_setup.webp" alt="" />

    Enter your personal information:
    - Your name
    - Your admin user name
    - Your email address
