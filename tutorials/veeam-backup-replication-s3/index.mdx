## Veeam Overview

[Veeam Backup & Replication](https://www.veeam.com/vm-backup-recovery-replication-software.html) is a proprietary backup application, developed by Veeam for virtual environments built on VMware vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisors.

The solution provides backup, restore and replication functionality for virtual machines, physical servers and workstations as well as cloud-based workloads.

A native S3 interface for Veeam Backup & Replication is part of the Release 9.5 update 4, available in General Availability since January 22nd 2019. It allows to push backups to a S3 compatible service to maximize backup capacity.

The following schema represents the functionality of Veeam Backup and Restore which acts as an intermediate agent to manage primary data storage and secondary and archival storage:

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have a machine running [VMware vSphere](https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere.html)
  - You have an intermediate instance running [Veeam Backup & Replication](https://www.veeam.com/vm-backup-recovery-replication-software.html)
  - You have an [Object Storage bucket](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)
</Message>

<Message type="important">
  - **[Glacier storage class](/storage/object/concepts/#storage-class) is currently not supported by Veeam.**
  If you use lifecycle rules to transition your objects from Standard to Glacier, you will lose the link between Veeam and your data. 
  In this case, your data will still exist, but it will no longer be useable. 
</Message>

<Message type="tip">
  By default, Veeam manages data in small objects of 1MB/object. For optimal performance and storage of your backups, the configuration of **Local Target (Large Blocks)** in the storage options of Veeam is recommended. This setting allows you to store your backups in objects of 4MB/object:

  We are currently working on a new backend (available in private beta), which will remove this limitation.

## Configuring Veeam backup & replication

<Message type="important">
  A Veeam **Enterprise** or **Enterprise Plus** license is required in order to configure the Scale out Repository feature which is required for Object Storage. Contact your Veeam Account Manager in case you need a license upgrade. [More information on Veeam Backup & Replication licensing.](https://www.veeam.com/products-edition-comparison.html)
