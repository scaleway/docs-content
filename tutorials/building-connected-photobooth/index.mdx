The [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) is a low-cost, low-power system-on-a-chip microcontroller with integrated WiFi and dual-mode Bluetooth. A Tensilica Xtensa LX6 microprocessor provides the computing power of the ESP32. Its small footprint and low power requirements make it ideal for Internet of Things (IoT) applications.

In this tutorial, we use the camera module available for the ESP32 to build an **IoT Photobooth**. It will allow us to take photos, publish them on a `SMILE` topic using [IoT Hub](https://www.scaleway.com/en/iot-hub/) and store our photos in an [Object Storage bucket](https://www.scaleway.com/en/object-storage/).

## Setting up your developer environment

1. Launch the Arduino IDE on your local computer. 

2. Open the Arduino preferences by clicking on **Arduino** > **Preferences**

3. Add the ESP32 board by adding the following board manager URL to the IDE: `https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json`. Confirm by clicking OK:
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-arduino-pref.png" alt="" />

4. Open the Board Manager by clicking on **Tools** > **Board: "..."** (the board name may differ on your computer) > **Boards Manager**:
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-board-manager.png" alt="" />

5. Type **esp32** in the search bar to locate the package including the official Espressif boards. Click **Install** to download and install them. In this tutorial, we use Version 1.0.5.
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-esp32-bm.png" alt="" />

6. Select the ESP32-CAM by clicking on **Tools**  > **Board: "..."** > **ESP32 Arduino** > **AI Thinker ESP32-CAM**:
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-aithinker-cam.png" alt="" />

## Creating the IoT Hub (message broker) and provisioning of the devices

1. Go to the [IoT Hub](https://console.scaleway.com/iot-hub/hubs) section in your Scaleway console. Click **Create a Hub** to launch the Hub creation wizard:
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-hub.png" alt="" />

2. Choose the **Free SHARED** Plan and enter your Hub's details:
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-hub-1.png" alt="" />

3. Click **Create and add a device** to deploy your Hub in a few seconds. 


## Adding Devices to your IoT Hub

In this tutorial, we will add two distinct devices: The camera itself, our ESP32-CAM hardware, and a software called "MQTT Explorer", which we will be using to trigger the camera and to view the payloads that are going through our Hub.

1. Enter a name for the first device, in our case, `camera`. For this tutorial, we **allow** insecure connections to make it easier. In a production environment you should always deny insecure connections for security reasons. Click **Add a Device to your Hub** to add the device:
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-device.png" alt="" />

2. Click **Add a new Device** and repeat the steps above for the second device, called `mqtt-explorer`. 

3. Click **Close** once the device is added. Your Hub should now have two devices: 
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-iothub-photobooth.png" alt="" />


## Configuring MQTT-Explorer

MQTT Explorer is a lightweight MQTT client, available for Windows, macOS, and most Linux distributions. It provides a structured overview of your MQTT topics and simplifies working with devices/services on your broker. If you have not installed MQTT-Explorer yet, download it from [the official website](http://mqtt-explorer.com/).

Launch MQTT-Explorer on your local computer and fill in the following connection information: 
  - **Host:** `iot.fr-par.scw.cloud`
  - **Username:** `your-device-id`

<Lightbox src="scaleway-mqtt-explorer.png" alt="" />

<Message type="note">

  The Device ID can be found on the overview tab when clicking on a device (see below).

</Message> 
<Lightbox src="scaleway-device-id.png" alt="" />

## Creating an Object Storage bucket

1. Create an Object Storage bucket to store your pictures in. Click on [Object Storage](https://console.scaleway.com/object-storage/buckets) in the side-menu, then **Create a Bucket**:
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-obj-storage.png" alt="" />

2. Name your bucket and chose a region in which your data will be stored:
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-obj-storage-1.png" alt="" />

3. Click on **Create a bucket** to complete the bucket-creation process. 

## Setting-up an IoT Route

IoT Routes allow your IoT Hub to forward messages to non-MQTT destinations. In this project, we will use the [Object Storage Route](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/create-route), which will enable us to communicate with the bucket created in the previous step.

1. Go back to the [IoT Hub](https://console.scaleway.com/iot-hub/hubs) section of the Scaleway console, select your Hub and click on Routes:
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-route.png" alt="" />

2. Create a new route with the following parameters: 

    - **Name:** `object-storage-route`
    - **Topic:** `PICTURE`
    - **Route Type:** Scaleway Object Storage
    - **Region:** Select the region corresponding to the region of your bucket
    - **Bucket:** Select your bucket from the drop-down list
    - **Prefix:** `PIC`
    - **Storage options:** Per message

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-route-1.png" alt="" />

3. Click **Add a new Route** to save the form and to create the new route. 

## Creating the ESP32-CAM Programm

As the cloud environment is set up, we will load our program on the ESP32-CAM module. Either start with the `CameraWebServer` example sketch, modifying the code according to your needs, or open the `SCW_Photobooth` sketch in this [GitHub repository](https://gitHub.com/luisomoreau/ESP32-cam-MQTT).

This tutorial uses the `SCW_Photobooth.ino` sketch, ready to support MQTT connections. 

1. Go to the Arduino IDE and open the `SCW_Photobooth.ino` sketch, available in the `SCW_Photobooth` folder of the repository. 

2. Set your WiFi config and edit one variable to make it working (the `mqttUser` must be your Scaleway Device ID):

  ```c
  //WIFI config
  const char* ssid = "your-ssid";
  const char* password = "your-passord";

  //MQTT config
  bool useMQTT = true;
  const char* mqttServer = "iot.fr-par.scw.cloud";
  const char* HostName = "Photobooth_Scaleway";
  const char* mqttUser = "your-device-id";
  const char* mqttPassword = "";
  const char* topic_PHOTO = "SMILE";
  const char* topic_PUBLISH = "PICTURE";
  const char* topic_FLASH = "FLASH";
  const int MAX_PAYLOAD = 60000; // Maximum payload size to be sent using MQTT (in Bytes)
  ```

3. Include the `PubSubClient` library in the Sketch by clicking on **Sketch** > **Include Library** > **Add .ZIP library**. You find the library in the `libraries` folder of the repository. 

4. Connect your ESP32-CAM board to a USB port of your compter to power it up. Select the USB port from the **Tools** > **Port** menu and upload the sketch by clicking on the Play button. 

5. Open the serial console by clicking on **Tools** > **Serial Monitor**. Once the code is uploaded your device will restart and boot the new code. Your device is ready once you will see a message like the following example:

  ```
  ..............................................
  WiFi connected
  Starting web server on port: '80'
  Starting stream server on port: '81'
  Camera Ready! Use 'http://192.168.43.23' to connect
  Attempting MQTT connection...connected
  ```

  <Message type="note">

    The device's IP configuration uses DHCP. Your local WiFi requires a running DHCP server. 

  </Message>

6. On the MQTT Explorer client, you can send an empty payload under the `SMILE` topic. Click on `PUBLISH`, and your camera will take a picture and publish it under the `PICTURE` topic.
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-arduino-console-mqtt-explorer.png" alt="" />

7. To see your pictures, go back to your [Object Storage bucket](https://console.scaleway.com/object-storage/buckets) in the Scaleway console. You should see your bucket populate more and more as you take new photos.

## Going further

The default `CameraWebServer` sketch also provides a web interface to take pictures and change settings. In this tutorial, we use a slightly modified `app_httpd.cpp` code to also send the picture when captured using the web interface.
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-diagram-2.png" alt="" />

To open the web interface, copy/paste the local IP provided by the Serial console in your web browser: 
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-ov2640-webinterface.png" alt="" />

Click on **Get still** at the bottom left corner. Once taken, the picture will be published under the PICTURE MQTT topic and then forwarded to your Object Storage bucket!

You can observe the upload from the serial console:

```
Sending picture...
Picture sent ? : 1
JPG: 4022B 28ms
```
