An Instance is a virtual machine in the cloud. Scaleway supports several [types of Instances](/instances/reference-content/choosing-instance-type/), each with their own set of resources, unique value propositions, and technical specifications. Each Instance supports the essential operating systems and distributions, as well as customized [Instantapps](/instances/concepts/#instantapp).

## Development Instances

Scaleway's **Development** range includes DEV1 and GP1 Instances. These Instances provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources, and can be used for a wide range of workloads. For example, they are ideally suited for scaling a development and testing environment, but also Content Management Systems (CMS) or microservices. They are also a good default choice if you are not sure which Instance type is best for your application.

See below the technical specifications of Development Instances:
