When you attach a resource to a Private Network, the Private Network's built in DHCP defines an IPv4 and IPv6 address for the resource on that network. This is managed via Scaleway's [internal IPAM](/network/vpc/concepts/#ipam).

However, in some cases an IP address may not be set for your resource on the Private Network. Read on below to find out more about this problem, and how to solve it.

## The IP address is displayed but I haven't activated DHCP on the network

You may have attached a resource to an "old" Private Network on which you [have not activated DHCP](/network/vpc/reference-content/vpc-migration/#dhcp-activation-on-pre-existing-private-networks). In this case, a private IP address for the resource is reserved on Scaleway's [internal IPAM](/network/vpc/concepts/#ipam), but not configured on the resource itself. The IP address shown in the console is therefore the reserved address only. 

You will need to carry out manual configuration to set the IP address on the resource, or [activate DHCP](/network/vpc/how-to/activate-dhcp/). 

We strongly recommend that you activate DHCP on the Private Network to let us automatically handle IP address management. However, if you prefer to carry out manual configuration, we suggest that you use the reserved IP address to avoid conflicts with our internal IPAM. Note that in this case, even if you configure the reserved IP address on the resource, it will remain greyed-out in the screen above.

Read our dedicated documentation about [VPC migration](/network/vpc/reference-content/vpc-migration/) for more information about how "old" Private Networks are migrated to the VPC, including DHCP activation.

## No IP address is displayed

You may find that no address displays at all when you try to [view your resource's IP address on the Private Network](/network/vpc/how-to/attach-resources-to-pn/). This is probably because the resource was attached to the Private Network some time ago, before the product was integrated with IPAM. Therefore, no address is reserved with the IPAM for the resource on this Private Network.

To fix this problem, **detach your resource from the Private Network, and reattach it.**
