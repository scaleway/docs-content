This guide provides instructions on connecting to your Scaleway Dedibox server using SSH (for Linux, macOS, and Windows) or Remote Desktop (for Windows Server).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- [Created and uploaded your SSH key](/dedibox-console/account/how-to/upload-an-ssh-key/)
- [Created](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/order-a-server/) and [installed](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/install-a-server/) a dedicated server and transferred your SSH key to the server during installation

## Connecting via SSH

### For macOS and Linux users

1. Open the terminal on your local machine.
2. Enter the command below, replacing `your_private_key` with the private key filename (typically `id_rsa`), `username` with the defined username, and `your_server_ip` with your serverâ€™s IP address:
    ```bash
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_private_key username@your_server_ip
    ```
3. If prompted, confirm the connection by typing `yes` and pressing **Enter**:
    ```
    The authenticity of host 'myhost.ext (212.47.226.35)' cannot be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is 4f:ba:65:cf:14:64:a7:1e:b6:07:7c:00:71:95:21:fa.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
    ```
4. You are now connected to your server.

## Connecting via Remote Desktop

If you have installed Windows Server on your Dedibox, follow these steps to connect using Remote Desktop:

1. Open **Remote Desktop Connection** on your local Windows machine.
2. Enter the IP address of your Dedibox server in the **Computer** field.
3. In the **Username** field, enter `Administrateur` (for Windows Server).
4. Click **Connect** and enter the password set during the server installation.
5. Confirm the connection if prompted.

You are now connected to the Windows Server graphical interface. For language settings, refer to the [Windows Server language change guide](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/change-win-server-language/).

## Transferring data to your server

You can transfer files to and from your Dedibox server using SFTP or SCP.

### Using SFTP with FileZilla

1. [Download and install FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org) on your local machine.
2. Open FileZilla and navigate to **File** > **Site Manager**.
3. Enter the following details:
    - **Protocol**: SFTP
    - **Host**: Your server's IP address
    - **Port**: 22
    - **User**: Your username
    - **Key file**: Your private key file location
4. Click **Connect** to start transferring files.

### Using SCP in a terminal

1. Open a terminal on your local machine.
2. Use the following command:
    ```s
    scp file username@ipaddress:/DestinationDirectory
    ```
    Replace:
    - **file**: Path of the file to transfer
    - **username**: Your username
    - **ipaddress**: Server IP address
    - **/DestinationDirectory**: Destination path on the server

    For example:
    ```s
    scp config.txt toto@62.210.***.***:/home/toto/prog/
    ```
