Domain names are locked by default to avoid any unsolicited outgoing transfer. If you want to transfer your domain to another registrar, you can unlock it from the Scaleway console.

<Message type="important">
  You cannot unlock internal domains for a period of 60 days after creating them.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An **internal domain** registered with Scaleway Domains and DNS

## How to unlock a domain name

1. Click **Domains and DNS** in the **Domains & Web Hosting** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu.
2. Click the domain you want to unlock. The domain's **Overview** tab displays.
