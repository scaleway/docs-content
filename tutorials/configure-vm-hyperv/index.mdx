## Hyper-V - Overview

[Microsoft Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/hyper-v-on-windows-server) is a hypervisor which allows creating virtual machines on x86-64 systems.
It is available since the release of Windows Server 2012.

A free stand-alone, but command-line only, version of Hyper-V Server is also available.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net)
  - You have a [Scaleway Dedibox](http://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox) server
  - You have at least one [failover IP](/dedibox-network/ip-failover/concepts/#failover-ips) with a [virtual MAC address](/dedibox-network/ip-failover/concepts/#virtual-mac-address)
  - Your Scaleway Dedibox server fulfills the hardware requirements of the [HyperV version](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/system-requirements-for-hyper-v-on-windows) used by you
</Message>

<Message type="note">
  This tutorial is based on the 2019 version of HyperV running on [Windows Server 2019](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2019).

## Installing HyperV

A Windows distribution can be installed on a Scaleway Dedibox server in two ways: through the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net/en/login) or through [KVM over IP](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch#KVM_over_IP_(IPKVM)>).

### Via the Dedibox console

When installing Windows automatically via the console, a monthly subscription to a license is required.

Scaleway Dedibox offers monthly subscriptions to different versions of Microsoft Windows Standard Server licenses, but to benefit from HyperV it is recommended to install the **2012 R2 English (64-bit)** version.

1. Access the server page of your Dedibox on the console and click **Install**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-click-on-install.webp" width="600" alt="" />
2. Click **Server Distributions**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-distribution-options.webp" width="600" alt="" />
3. Select **Windows** on the distribution menu, then **windows standard_2012_r2 64BITS** under **Choose a Version** and click **Install Windows**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-install-windows.webp" width="600" alt="" />
4. Complete the next steps by including your **Partitioning** and **System Configuration** preferences when requested and conclude installation.

### Via KVM over IP

Your server can also be booted from a Windows Server ISO file through a KVM over IP device if included in your Dedibox. This type of installation gives you the possibility of installing your own licenses or remote ISO files.

<Message type="tip">
  You can download Windows and HyperV ISO images from Microsoft's [evaluation center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter).
</Message>

1. Access the server page of your Dedibox on the console and click **Install** to begin installation via KVM over IP.
2. Click **on KVM over IP**. A Disclaimer window pops up. 
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kvm-over-ip.webp" width="600" alt="" />
3. Click **I ACCEPT** once you have read and agreed to the terms displayed. You are redirected to your server's status page.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-disclaimer.webp" width="300" alt="" />
4. Click the third button on the right. The model of the KVM over IP device is determined by the brand of your Dedibox chassis. For a Dell chassis, use **IDRAC**.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-idrac.webp" width="600" alt="" />

The process from this step forward may differ according to the KVM model being used. Refer to the technical documentation of your machine to conclude the installation.

### HyperV on Windows

1. Connect to your server using the [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol) once the installation is complete, and launch the Application **Hyper-V Manager** from the **Windows Administrative Tools** section of the start menu:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-hyperv_manager.webp" width="250" alt="" />

  <Message type="note">
    If you can not find the **Hyper-V Manager** application on your machine, the Hyper-V role might not be installed. You can [install the role](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/get-started/install-the-hyper-v-role-on-windows-server) from the Windows Server Manager.

## Deploying a Virtual Machine

1. Click **New** in the **Actions** menu, then **Virtual Machine** in the Hyper-V Manager application to launch the virtual machine creation wizard:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-hyperv_01.webp" width="800" alt="" />
2. Click **Next** to begin the configuration of the new virtual machine:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-hyperv_02.webp" width="600" alt="" />
3. Choose a name and a location for the virtual machine. If no specific configuration is required from your side, leave the default value:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-hyperv_03.webp" width="600" alt="" />
4. Choose the generation of the virtual machine. You can either use the older **Generation 1** for compatibility with older versions of Hyper-V, or the newer **Generation 2**. For more information about the different generations, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/plan/should-i-create-a-generation-1-or-2-virtual-machine-in-hyper-v).
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-hyperv_04.webp" width="600" alt="" />
5. Assign memory to the virtual machine. You can either define a static value or enable dynamic memory allocation, depending on your workloads:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-hyperv_05.webp" width="600" alt="" />
6. Choose the network for the virtual machine. If your Dedibox has more than one network interface, choose the public Internet facing network adapter from the drop-down list:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-hyperv_06.webp" width="600" alt="" />
7. Connect the virtual hard disk to the virtual machine. Either create a new virtual disk, or choose an existing disk to restore a machine from a previous backup. By default, all virtual disks are stored in the directory `C:\Users\Public\Documents\Hyper-V\Virtual Hard Disks\`. Choose the disk size for the virtual machine towards your requirements:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-hyperv_07.webp" width="600" alt="" />
8. Choose the installation options for the virtual machine. In order to create the machine without an operating system, specify a local ISO file or provide information for a network-based installation server. If you have downloaded an ISO file to install your OS, choose the second option and specify the file path before clicking **Next**. Then a configuration summary displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-hyperv_08.webp" width="600" alt="" />
9. Click **Finish** to launch the creation of the virtual machine:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-hyperv_09.webp" width="600" alt="" />
10. Assign a virtual MAC address to the failover IP from the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net/) to make sure that the virtual machine is able to communicate on the Internet. Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/dedibox-network/ip-failover/how-to/create-virtual-mac/) for more information about how to create a virtual MAC address. Click **Settings** in the VM section of the menu.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-hyperv_10.webp" width="800" alt="" />
11. Click **Network Adapter** (1), **Advanced Features** (2), then on **Static** in the **MAC Address** section. Enter the virtual MAC address of the failover IP in the form and validate by clicking on **Apply**, then **OK** to leave the settings window.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-hyperv_11.webp" width="800" alt="" />
12. Start the Virtual Machine by clicking on **Start** in the side menu. The virtual machine will boot from the ISO file and the installation wizard of the operating system displays. Follow the steps of the wizard to complete the installation.
13. Configure the virtual networking as described in our [documentation](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/configure-flexible-ip/) once the installation of the guest OS has completed. Then, you may run a ping test to check the connectivity of the virtual machine:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-hyperv_12.webp" width="800" alt="" />
