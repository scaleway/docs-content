## Netbox - Overview

[NetBox](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox) is a web application designed and built to help manage and document large computer networks. It is designed for IP address management (IPAM) and data center infrastructure management (DCIM). The application runs as a web application based on the Django Python framework and uses a PostgreSQL database to store information. The open source software was developed specifically with the needs of network and infrastructure engineers in mind.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to install and configure NetBox on an Instance running on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and a Database for PostgreSQL.

<Message type="requirement">

</Message>

## Configuring the database

NetBox requires a PostgreSQL database. Configure your [Database for PostgreSQL](https://www.scaleway.com/en/databases/) with a few steps from your [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/rdb/Instances)

1. Enter the Databases section of your [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/rdb/Instances) by clicking on **Databases** in the side menu.

2. Click the name of the Database you want to use to view the Instance's details:
<Lightbox src="scaleway-db_instance_list.webp" alt="" />

3. Click the **Databases** tab to view the databases of your instance.
<Lightbox src="scaleway-dbaas_databases_list.webp" alt="" />

4. Click **+ Add Database**. The new database dialog appears.

5. Enter the name for the new database (`netbox`) and click **Create Database** to launch the database creation:
<Lightbox src="scaleway-dbaas_new_db.webp" alt="" />

6. Select the **Users** tab to view the users of your Database Instance.

7. Click **+ Add user** to create a new `netbox` user for the database. Enter the identifier and password for the user:
<Lightbox src="scaleway-dbaas_new_user.webp" alt="" />

8. Then click the **Permissions** tab and set **ALL** permissions for the user on the `netbox` table.

9. Once done, click **Create a user** to validate the form and launch the user creation process:
<Lightbox src="scaleway-dbaas_permissions.webp" alt="" />

## Installing NetBox

1. Log into your instance using [SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).

2. Update the `apt` package cache and upgrade the software already installed on the instance to the latest version available in Ubuntu's repositories:
  ```
  apt update && apt upgrade -y
  ```

3. Install the required packages using the `apt` package manager:
  ```
  apt install -y libpq-dev python3 python3-pip python3-dev python3-venv build-essential libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libffi-dev graphviz libpq-dev libssl-dev redis-server zlib1g-dev git nginx
  ```

4. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/releases/latest) of NetBox. At the time of writing this tutorial it is version 3.2.3. Unpack it into the `/opt` directory:
  ```
  wget https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/archive/refs/tags/v3.2.3.tar.gz && tar -xzf v3.2.3.tar.gz -C /opt
  ```

5. Create a symlink from the actual netbox directory to `/opt/netbox`:
  ```
  ln -s /opt/netbox-3.2.3/ /opt/netbox
  ```

6. Create a new system user for the NetBox application:
  ```
  adduser --system --group netbox
  ```

7. Set the ownership of the `/opt/netbox/netbox/media/` to the `netbox` user. This is important as otherwise NetBox will not be able to write in this directory and you will not be able to upload any documents or images.
  ```
  chown --recursive netbox /opt/netbox/netbox/media/
  ```

8.  Move into the NetBox configuration directory:
  ```
  cd /opt/netbox/netbox/netbox/
  ```

9. Make a copy of `configuration.example.py` and name it `configuration.py`:
  ```
  cp configuration.example.py configuration.py
  ```

10. Open the configuration file in a text editor of your choice, e.g. `nano`:
  ```
  nano configuration.py
  ```

11. Edit the variables `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `DATABASE`, `REDIS`, `SECRET_KEY` as following:

- `ALLOWED_HOSTS` specifies the hostnames or IP-addresses that are used for the NetBox instance:
  ```
  ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['netbox.example.com', '198.51.100.35']
  ```

- `DATABASE` specifies the database credentials of your PostgreSQL database. Use the database `netbox` with the credentials of the `netbox` user previously created. You can find the required database host and port on the Instance Information in your [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com/rdb/Instances).
  ```
  DATABASE = {
      'NAME': 'netbox',                             # Database name
      'USER': 'netbox',                             # PostgreSQL username
      'PASSWORD': '<YOUR_DATABASE_USER_PASSWORD>',  # PostgreSQL password
      'HOST': '<YOUR_RDB_IP>',                      # Database server IP (available in your Scaleway console)
      'PORT': '<YOUR_RDB_PORT>',                    # Database port (available in your Scaleway console)
      'CONN_MAX_AGE': 300,                          # Maximum database connection age
  }
  ```

- `REDIS` specifies the configuration parameters of Redis, an in-memory key-value store required as part of the NetBox installation. For most installations the default configuration is good enough and you can leave it as it is. For more information about advanced Redis configuration, you may refer to the [official documentation](https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration/required-settings/#redis).

- `SECRET_KEY` specifies a secret cryptographic key that is used to improve the security of cookies and password resets. It should be at least 50 characters long and should not be shared outside the configuration file. You may change the value of the key at any time, resulting in a termination of all active sessions.

Enter the key in the configuration file as follows, then save the file and exit your text editor:
  ```
  SECRET_KEY = 'uyK5ajt-Vl$!gd2HeLbN=^6@&EhDmv8%)zT1S03kXPCsUGrI9_'
  ```
<Message type="important">

The `SECRET_KEY` is not used for hashing user passwords or for the encrypted storage of secret data in NetBox.  
NetBox comes with a script, that you may use to generate a random key:
```
python3 /opt/netbox/netbox/generate_secret_key.py
```

</Message>

12. Once NetBox has been configured, proceed with the actual installation by running the packaged upgrade script (`upgrade.sh`):
  ```
  /opt/netbox/upgrade.sh
  ```

This script performs the following actions on your instance:

- Creating a Python virtual environment
- Installing all required Python packages
- Running database schema migrations
- Aggregating static resource files on disk

<Message type="note">
  
  The upgrade script may warn you, that no existing virtual environment was detected. As this is a new installation, you can safely ignore this warning.

</Message>

The basic configuration for NetBox is done now, several other configuration options are available but optional. Refer to the [official documentation](https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration/optional-settings/) for more information on them.

## Creating a superuser

NetBox does not come with any default user accounts. Create a first user by completing the following steps:

1. Enter the NetBox `venv` created by the installation script:
  ```
  source /opt/netbox/venv/bin/activate
  ```

2. Enter into the `netbox` directory:
  ```
  cd /opt/netbox/netbox
  ```

3. Run the `manage.py` script as follows:
  ```
  python3 manage.py createsuperuser
  ```

Enter the `username`, `email`, `password`, and `password confirmation` for the user and confirm by pressing Enter. The following message displays once the user is created: `Superuser created successfully.`

## Testing the application

1. Run the following command to start a test webserver with the NetBox application:
  ```
  python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 --insecure
  ```

2. Open a web browser and point it to the IP address or hostname of your instance on port 8000: `http://netbox.example.com:8000`. The NetBox dashboard displays.

3. Terminate the test webserver by pressing `CTRL`+ `C`.

## Configuring gunicorn

[gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) is a Python [WSGI](https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what.html) HTTP Server for UNIX which will be used to serve the NetBox application to Nginx.

1. Copy the gunicorn configuration file from the `contrib` directory to its final destination:
  ```
  cp /opt/netbox/contrib/gunicorn.py /opt/netbox/gunicorn_config.py
  ```

The configuration file shipped with the NetBox application works for most setups, however if you need some specific settings, refer to the [gunicorn documentation](https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/configure.html).

## Configuring systemd

We use systemd to start NetBox automatically during the boot process of the instance.

1. Copy the systemd scripts from the `contrib` directory to their final location:
  ```
  cp /opt/netbox/contrib/*.service /etc/systemd/system/
  ```

2. Reload they systemd daemon:
  ```
  systemctl daemon-reload
  ```

3. Start and enable the `netbox-rq` service
  ```
  systemctl start netbox netbox-rq
  systemctl enable netbox netbox-rq
  ```

## Configuring a NGINX Reverse Proxy

To provide an additional layer of security, NetBox will be running behind a [NGINX reverse proxy](/tutorials/nginx-reverse-proxy). This proxy replies to all requests to NetBox and avoids exposing the application directly on the Internet.

1. Create and open the file `/etc/nginx/sites-available/netbox.conf` in a text editor of your choice, i.e. `nano`:
  ```
  nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/netbox.conf
  ```

2. Copy the following configuration into the file `/etc/nginx/sites-available/netbox.conf`. Make sure to replace `netbox.example.com` with the hostname of your instance.
  ```
  server {
      listen 80;

      # CHANGE THIS TO YOUR SERVER'S NAME
      server_name netbox.example.com;

      client_max_body_size 25m;

      location /static/ {
          alias /opt/netbox/netbox/static/;
      }

      location / {
          proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8001;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $http_host;
          proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
      }
  }
  ```

Save the file and exit the text editor.

3. Create a symlink to enable the new configuration with NGINX:
  ```
  ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/netbox.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/netbox.conf
  ```

4. Reload NGINX to activate the new configuration:
  ```
  service nginx reload
  ```

5. Install `certbot` to configure a TLS encrypted connection to your NetBox instance:
  ```
  apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
  ```

6. Run `certbot` to request a TSL/SSL certificate for your NetBox instance, issued by the [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate authority:
  ```
  certbot --nginx
  ```

Follow our [dedicated documentation](/tutorials/configure-nginx-lets-encrypt/) about Let's Encrypt for detailed information how to use the `certbot` tool.

7. Open your web browser and point it to your NetBox domain (i.e. `http://netbox.example.com`). The Netbox dashboard displays:
<Lightbox src="scaleway-dbaas_netbox_dashboard.webp" alt="" />

You can log into Netbox by clicking on the **Log In** button in the top right corner using the username and password of the superuser configured in a previous step.

## Conclusion

You now have successfully installed Netbox and linked it with a managed PostgreSQL database. The application is now ready to be configured. You can add your servers, racks and other network equipment directly from the NetBox webinterface.

For more information how to add your devices to NetBox, refer to the [official documentation](https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
