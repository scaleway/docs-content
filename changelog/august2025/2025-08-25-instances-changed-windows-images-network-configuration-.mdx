title: Windows Images - Network configuration now uses DHCP. Serial console enabled

The newly released Windows server 2022 and Windows server 2022 core images now use DHCP for network configuration. This is the default mechanism for all existing Instances O/S Images.

For currently running instances, no specific network configuration is required unless you decide to change the public IPv4 address of your instance.

In this case, the existing static configuration will remain and your instance will keep using the previous public IPv4 address. To enable DHCP configuration for your instance do the following prior to setting a new public IPv4 address. 

<Message type=important> There is a risk of loosing network connectivity while doing the following steps. It is advisable to enable the serial console prior to run those steps so you keep serial access to your instance. The method is described in the document [Azure Serial Console for Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/windows/serial-console-windows)</Message>

Not that the last step reboots your instance.  This step may be delayed until a reboot is possible :
