## Veeam Overview

[Veeam Backup & Replication](https://www.veeam.com/vm-backup-recovery-replication-software.html) is a proprietary backup application, developed by Veeam for virtual environments built on VMware vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisors.

The solution provides backup, restore, and replication functionality for virtual machines, physical servers, and workstations as well as cloud-based workloads.

A native Object Storage interface for Veeam Backup & Replication is part of the Release 9.5 update 4, available in General Availability since January 22nd, 2019. It allows to push backups to an Amazon S3-compatible service to maximize backup capacity.

The following schema represents the functionality of Veeam Backup and Restore which acts as an intermediate agent to manage primary data storage and secondary and archival storage:

<Lightbox image={image} alt="" />

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A machine running [VMware vSphere](https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere.html)
- An intermediate Instance running [Veeam Backup & Replication](https://www.veeam.com/vm-backup-recovery-replication-software.html)
- An [Object Storage bucket](/object-storage/how-to/create-a-bucket/)

<Message type="important">
  - **[Glacier storage class](/object-storage/concepts/#storage-class) is currently not supported by Veeam.**
  If you use lifecycle rules to transition your objects from Standard to Glacier, you will lose the link between Veeam and your data. 
  In this case, your data will still exist, but it will no longer be usable. 
</Message>

<Message type="tip">
  By default, Veeam manages data in small objects of 1 MB/object. For optimal performance and storage of your backups, the configuration of **Local Target (Large Blocks)** in the storage options of Veeam is recommended. This setting allows you to store your backups in objects of 4MB/object:

## Configuring Veeam backup & replication

<Message type="important">
  You must have a Veeam **Enterprise** or **Enterprise Plus** license to configure the Scale out Repository feature, which is required for Object Storage. Contact your Veeam Account Manager in case you need a license upgrade. More information on [Veeam Backup & Replication licensing](https://www.veeam.com/products-edition-comparison.html).

    <Lightbox image={image24} alt="" />

### Configuring a scale-out repository

1. Enter the **Scale-out Repositories** section:
    <Lightbox image={image25} alt="" />
2. Enter a **Name** and an optional **Description** for the Scale-out repository, then click **Next**:
    <Lightbox image={image26} alt="" />
3. Click **Add** and choose the local Backup repository from the list. Confirm and click **Next**:
    <Lightbox image={image27} alt="" />
4. Choose the **Placement Policy** for the repository. The default settings can be used, click **Next**:
    <Lightbox image={image28} alt="" />
5. Click **Extend Scale-out capacity with Object Storage** and choose your Object Storage repository from the drop-down list. It is also possible to define a time frame in which backups are uploaded to Object Storage and after how many days backups are transferred automatically. If required data can also be encrypted by activating the option. Once the Object Storage settings are configured, click **Apply**:
    <Lightbox image={image29} alt="" />

    <Lightbox image={image39} alt="" />
3. Click **Add** (1) and choose the virtual machines or hypervisors (2) to be backed up. Once finished, click **Next**:
    <Lightbox image={image40} alt="" />
4. Choose the previously configured Scale-out repository from the drop-down menu and choose the restore points to keep on disk for the backup. Click **Next** once this is done:
    <Lightbox image={image41} alt="" />
5. Configure guest OS processing options for virtual machines (the default settings are usually sufficient), then click **Next**:
    <Lightbox image={image42} alt="" />
6. Configure a schedule to execute the backup job automatically. If no schedule is configured, the job must be started manually for each backup. Once the schedule is set, click **Next**:
    <Lightbox image={image43} alt="" />
7. A summary of the configured job is shown. Tick the box **Run the job when I click Finish** to execute the job immediately. If the box is not ticked, the first backup will be created according to the schedule. Click **Finish** to exit the wizard:
    <Lightbox image={image44} alt="" />

Veeam proceeds with the backup and stores data on Object Storage. To verify it, log yourself into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com), enter the Object Storage section, and choose the Bucket used for Veeam. Several files and folders created by the application are visible:

## Troubleshooting

This section is designed to help you solve common issues encountered while performing the actions described in the procedure.

### Bucket access errors

#### Error messages

- `Failed to preprocess target Error: S3 error: Access Denied`
- `Error: Shared memory connection was closed.`
- `Failed to upload disk 'shadowSpec>'`
- `Agent failed to process method {DataTransfer.SyncDisk}.`

#### Cause

The application cannot access the Object Storage resource.

#### Solution

If you encounter one or several of the error messages above:

- make sure that you have the `ObjectStorageFullAccess` [IAM permission](/iam/concepts/#permission).

- make sure that there is no [bucket policy](/object-storage/api-cli/bucket-policy/) preventing the application to access your bucket.

### Too many requests error

#### Error messages

- `Error: S3 error: Too Many Requests`
- `Code: Too Many Requests`
- `Shared memory connection was closed.`
- `Agent failed to process method {DataTransfer.SyncDisk}.`

#### Cause

Scaleway Object Storage applies a rate limit on PUT operations for safety reasons.

#### Solution

You can limit the number of concurrent tasks and update the timeout duration of Object Storage requests on the Veeam Backup & Replication server managing the backup copy operation by adding the elements below:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Veeam\Veeam Backup and Replication

S3ConcurrentTaskLimit
Type: REG_DWORD
Value: 8

Type: DWORD
Name: S3RequestTimeoutSec
Value: 900

Type: DWORD
Name: S3RequestRetryTotalTimeoutSec
Value: 9000
```

Then, restart every Veeam service, or restart the Veeam server.

<Message type="note">
You may experience reduced throughput due to the limitation.
</Message>

### Going further

If you did not manage to identify the error and solve it by yourself, [open a support ticket](/account/how-to/open-a-support-ticket/), and provide as many details as possible, along with the necessary information below:

- Object Storage Endpoint (e.g. `s3.fr-par.scw.cloud`)
- Bucket name
- Object name (if the request concerns an object)
- Request type (PUT, GET, etc.)
- HTTP status code
- Date and time (timestamp)
- User-agent (SDK, client, console, etc.)
- Transaction ID (if possible)
- Log / trace of the error (if possible)
