## Ruby on Rails InstantApp - Overview

The intended audience of this image is Rails developers who want to bootstrap or test a Rails application easily, in seconds.

Common packages have been installed:

- Nginx
- Ruby
- RVM
- Rails
- Unicorn
- Node.js

> **Requirements**

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have [configured your SSH Key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)

### Create and start a new instance using the Ruby on Rails InstantApp

Before starting, click the "Create a Server" button in the control panel.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-nc-new-server.png" alt="" />

You will land on the server-creation page where you can choose the **Ruby on Rails** image in the **InstantApps** tab for your Cloud Instance:

<Lightbox src="scaleway-nc-instantapps.png" alt="" />

Choose the server type and click the **Create a Server** button. This action starts your server.

### Run a Ruby on Rails web application

Log into your server with the following command:

{% highlight sh %}
$> ssh -i /path/to/key root@<your_server_ip>
{% endhighlight %}

Once connected to the server, log-in as rails user:

{% highlight sh %}
$> su rails
$> source /etc/profile
{% endhighlight %}

In the home directory of rails user `/home/rails`, you will find the `default` directory containing a fresh rails application. You can use it to bootstrap your rails project.

Unicorn is configured to serve the default Rails application in `/home/rails/default`.

You can access the Rails application via your browser at `http://your_server_ip` to view the default app website.

If you want to create a new Rails application, you will have to use the following commands to get it running with unicorn:

{% anchor h4%}
Create a new Rail application

{% highlight sh %}
$> rails new yourapplicationname
{% endhighlight %}

{% anchor h4%}
Generate SECRET_KEY_BASE

{% highlight sh %}
$> rake -f /home/rails/yourapplicationame/Rakefile secret
{% endhighlight %}

{% anchor h4%}
Edit Unicorn configuration

Open the file `/etc/default/unicorn` to change the working directory and SECRET_KEY_BASE.

Set application working directory to `APP_ROOT=/home/rails/yourapplicationame` and SECRET_KEY_BASE value to the key generated previously.

Then in `/etc/unicorn.conf` change the `working_directory` value to `/home/rails/yourapplicationame`.

Restart Unicorn as `root` user, open your browser and visit your IP to view your new application. 

{% highlight sh %}
$> service unicorn restart
{% endhighlight %}

Suggestions

If you think something is missing in this image, or if it would have been
easier if you had this or that tool, or if this `<whatever>` should be configured
that way instead of how it currently is, we'd love to hear from you!
