Scaleway Messaging and Queuing is evolving. We have increased the limitations on our resource quotas, meaning that each Scaleway Project can now scale up to:
- 50 SQS queues
- 50 SNS topics
- 50 NATS streams

This update empowers you to handle larger workloads and enables more robust communication.

For detailed information on the limitations and capabilities of our Messaging and Queuing protocols, please refer to the [documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/organizations-and-projects/additional-content/organization-quotas/).
