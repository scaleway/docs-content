The configuration of a flexible IPv6 depends on the Linux distribution running on your machine. You can configure your flexible IPv6 on machines running Debian, Ubuntu, or CentOS.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="note">
  Make sure your flexible IPv6 is [attached](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/attach-detach-flexible-ip/) to your Elastic Metal server before configuring it.

  You can find information about the DNS resolver to use in each datacenter at the [network reference documentation](/console/account/reference-content/scaleway-network-information/#dns-cache-servers).

## How to configure IPv6 on Debian

1. Open the network configuration file `/etc/network/interfaces` in a text editor and edit it as follows:
    ```
    auto eno1
    iface eno1 inet6 static
        address IPV6_ADDRESS
        netmask 64
    ```

    Remember to replace `eno1` with the proper Internet interface name.
2. Restart the network:
    ```
    sudo systemctl restart networking.service
    ```

<Message type="tip">
  The network interface is initialized with the command `allow-hotplug` by default on Debian 9. It is possible that the network restart fails with this configuration. In this case, you can initialize the network with `auto` to avoid the problem.

## How to configure IPv6 on Ubuntu

Ubuntu uses [netplan](https://netplan.io) as network configuration tool since the release of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
It replaces the classical network configuration with new configuration files, written in [YAML](https://yaml.org) format, and located in the `/etc/netplan` directory. For more information regarding netplan, refer to the official [netplan documentation](https://netplan.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/).

1. Open the default configuration file `/etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml` in a text editor, and edit it as follows:
    ```yaml
    # This is the network config written by 'subiquity'
    network:
    ethernets:
        eno1:
        critical: true
        dhcp-identifier: mac
        dhcp4: true
        addresses: [ "IPV6_ADDRESS/64" ]
        nameservers:
            addresses:
            - 62.210.16.6
            - 62.210.16.7
            search:
            - online.net
    version: 2
    ```

    Remember to replace `eno1` with the proper name of your Internet interface. 

    <Message type="note">
      The configuration example above is valid for the main IP address of your Dedibox server. If you want to use IPv6 on a [virtual machine](/dedibox-network/network/how-to/configure-network-netplan/#configuring-failover-ip-for-virtual-machines), remember to use the unique gateway for the failover IPv4.
    </Message>
2. Check and validate your configuration file.
    ```
    sudo netplan try
    ```
3. Activate the new configuration: 
    ```
    sudo netplan apply
    ```

## How to configure IPv6 on CentOS

1. Open the automatically generated configuration file for your Internet interface in a text editor, for example `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0` and edit it as follows: 
    ```
    # Generated by parse-kickstart
    UUID=xxxxx
    DNS1="62.210.16.6"
    IPADDR="DEDIBOX_MAIN_IP"
    GATEWAY="DEDIBOX_MAIN_IP_1" # The IPv4 gateway is your servers main IP address ending on .1 (e.g. Your servers IP is 62.210.16.123 means the gateway is 61.210.16.1)
    NETMASK="255.255.255.0"
    IPV6ADDR="IPV6_ADDRESS/64"
    IPV6_AUTOCONF="yes"
    BOOTPROTO="static"
    DEVICE="eth0"
    ONBOOT="yes"
    IPV6INIT="yes"
    ```
2. Restart the networking service:
    ```
    systemctl restart network.service
    ```
