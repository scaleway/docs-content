n8n is an open-source workflow automation tool that allows users to build automated workflows by connecting various AI agents, apps, and services. It provides a visual interface to facilitate the creation of workflows - this document will show you how to use this interface to integrate Scaleway Generative APIs, by:
- Adding a chat model to a workflow
- Adding an embedding model to a workflow

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) for API authentication
- [Installed n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/) on your local machine

## Adding a chat model

You can add a chat model to a workflow by adding an **AI Agent** node, and configuring it to use Scaleway Generative APIs. Follow the steps below.

1. Open the n8n visual interface on your local machine.

    <Lightbox image={scwN8nInterface} alt="The visual interface of n8n displayed in a browser" />

2. Click `+` > **Workflow** in the top left corner to create a new workflow.
3. Click **Add first step** to define what will trigger this workflow.
4. Type **AI agent** in the search bar, and select that option from the search results.
    A form displays prompting you to define parameters and settings for the AI agent. You can come back to this later, if necessary.
5. Click **Back to canvas** in the top left corner.
    A canvas displays, visually showing the trigger **When chat message received**, connected to the node **AI agent**.
6. Click **Chat Model +** underneath the AI agent node to define a chat model for the agent.
    A list of language models displays.
7. Select **OpenAI Chat Model**.
    A form displays prompting you to define parameters and settings for the model.
8. Under **Credential to connect with**, click **Select Credential** > **Create new credential**.
    A form displays prompting you to enter the credentials.
9. Fill in the form, to add where prompted:
    - The secret part of your [Scaleway API key](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/api-keys)
    - The URL `https://api.scaleway.ai/v1` as your base URL
    <Message type="tip">
    If you are using a Project other than your [default Project](/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#default-project), modify the base URL accordingly: `https://api.scaleway.ai/{project_id}/v1`
    </Message>
10. Click **Save**.
    The credentials are saved, and an automatic connection test is carried out, displaying the message **Connected tested successfully**. This confirms that n8n can access the `/v1/models` and `/v1/chat/completions` endpoints. 
11. Close the credentials screen to go back to the model parameters.
12. Under **Model**, click your chosen model, e.g. `llama-3.3-70b-instruct`.
13. Click **Back to canvas** in the top left corner.

<Lightbox image={scwN8nChatmodel} alt="The visual interface of n8n shows the chat model workflow" />


Your AI agent node is now configured to use the model you configured via Scaleway Generative APIs.

### Testing the model

You can test the model by opening a chat from the interface, asking it questions and checking the answers.

1. Click the **Open chat** button at the bottom of the screen.
    The chat interface displays.
2. Enter your question in the **Chat** box on the left, e.g. `How much is 1 + 1 ?`, and send it.
3. Check the result that displays in the **Output** box on the right, e.g. `I can calculate that for you. The answer is 2.`.

### Adding tools

You can add **tools** to the AI Agent node you created, to define new capabilities and actions for the agent. A "tool" lets the agent, for example, call another n8n workflow, make an HTTP request, or run pre-defined code.

In the example below, we create and add a code tool to provide weather information.

1. Click **Tool +** underneath the AI agent node to define a new tool for the agent.
  A list of tools displays.
2. Click **Code Tool**.
  A form displays prompting you to define parameters and settings for the tool.
3. In the **Description** box, enter `This tool provides the weather in Paris.`
4. Under **Language**, select **Javascript**.
5. In the **Javascript** code box, edit the return statement in the sample code as follows:
    ```javascript
    return "Paris is sunny with clear skies, and the temperature is 30 degrees"
    ```
6. Click **Back to canvas** in the top left corner.

Now when you [test the model](#testing-the-model) by asking a question such as `What's the weather in Paris?`, you should see via the workflow that the agent calls the code tool, and ultimately returns the answer `Paris is sunny with clear skies, and the temperature is 30 degrees`.

<Message type="tip">

You can also specify a schema to define the input the tool receives, and modify the code accordingly. For example, edit the tool description with `This tool provides the weather in a city`, and edit the Javascript as follows:

  ```
  let weather = "unknown";
  if (query.city === "Paris") {
      weather = "sunny";
  } else if (query.city === "London") {
      weather = "rainy";
  }
  return weather;
  ```

Toggle the **Specify Input Schema** setting on, and under **Schema Type** select **Define using JSON Schema**. Add the following input schema:

    ```json
    {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
         	"city": {
          		"type": "string",
          		"description": "City name"
          		}
         	}
    }
    ```
  
Now when you ask `What's the weather in London?` you should get the output `rainy.`, and `What's the weather in Tokyo` should generate the response `unknown`.

## Adding an embedding model

You can add an embedding model to a workflow by adding a **Simple Vector Store** node, and configuring it to use Scaleway Generative APIs. Follow the steps below to see how to create a workflow that takes a chat message as an input, and outputs an embedding of the message (list of vectors).

1. Open the n8n visual interface on your local machine.

    <Lightbox image={scwN8nInterface} alt="The visual interface of n8n displayed in a browser" />

2. Click `+` > **Workflow** in the top left corner to create a new workflow.
3. Click **Add first step** to define what will trigger this workflow.
3. Select **On chat message** as the trigger, then click **Back to canvas**.
4. Test the chat by sending a message in the bottom left. The output is a JSON object containing session ID, action and chatInput fields.
5. Click `+` to the right of your **When chat message received** node to define what happens next.
6. Type **Simple Vector Store** in the search bar, and select that option from the search results.
7. From the **Actions** sub-menu that displays, click **Add documents to vector store**.
    A form displays prompting you to define parameters and settings.
8. Click **+** under **Embeddings** at the bottom of the form to add an embedding.
    A list of embeddings nodes displays.
9. Click **Embeddings OpenAPI**.
    A form displays prompting you to define parameters and settings.
10. Under **Credential to connect with**, select existing credentials and skip to step 15, or click **Select Credential** > **Create new credential**.
    A form displays prompting you to enter the credentials.
11. Fill in the form, to add where prompted:
    - The secret part of your [Scaleway API key](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/api-keys)
    - The URL `https://api.scaleway.ai/v1` as your base URL
    <Message type="tip">
    If you are using a Project other than your [default Project](/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#default-project), modify the base URL accordingly: `https://api.scaleway.ai/{project_id}/v1`
    </Message>
12. Click **Save**.
    The credentials are saved, and an automatic connection test is carried out, displaying the message **Connected tested successfully**. This confirms that n8n can access the `/v1/models` and `/v1/chat/completions` endpoints. 
13. Close the credentials screen to go back to the **Parameters** tab.
14. Under **Model**, click your chosen model, e.g. `bge-multilingual-gemma2` (other listed models are not supported by Scaleway Generative APIs at the time of writing).
    <Message type="note">
    For n8n versions earlier than `1.104.1`, a [known issue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues/16716) prevents the model list from displaying. If you cannot upgrade your n8n version, you can still Select **Expression** instead of **Fixed** and type the model name.
    </Message>
15. Click **Back to canvas** in the top left corner.
16. Click **Document +** underneath the Simple Vector Store node.
  A list of document loaders displays.
17. Click **Default Data Loader**.
  A form displays prompting you to define parameters and settings for the data loader.
18. Under **Mode**, select ** Load Specific Data**.
17. Drag and drop the **chatInput** field from the **Input** panel on the left into the **Data** field of the main form. Alternatively type `{{ $('When chat message received').item.json.chatInput }}` into the **Data** field.
18. Click **Back to canvas**

### Testing the workflow

You can test the workflow by opening a chat from the interface, sending it a message, and checking that the output is an embedding (list of vectors). 

1. Click the **Open chat** button at the bottom of the screen.
    The chat interface displays.
2. Enter your chat input in the **Chat** box on the left, e.g. `This is a message to embed`, and send it.
3. In the middle **Logs** panel, click **Simple Vector Store** > **Embeddings OpenAI**.
5. Check that the input shows your chat message, and the output is an embedding (list of vectors).

### Going further

You now know how to add a simple embedding model to your n8n workflows. To go further, you can:

- Replace the **Simple Vector Store** node with a persistent storage node, such as **Postgres PGVector Store** or **Qdrant Vector Store**.
- Implement a RAG pipeline using Vector retrieval components, such as **AI Agent** and **Query Data Tool** (using for instance [RAG Starter Template](https://n8n.io/workflows/5010-rag-starter-template-using-simple-vector-stores-form-trigger-and-openai/)).
