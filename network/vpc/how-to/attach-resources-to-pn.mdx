VPC allows you to build your own **V**irtual **P**rivate **C**loud on top of Scaleway's shared public cloud. Within each VPC, you can create multiple **Private Networks** and attach Scaleway resources to them, as long as the resources are in an AZ within the network's region. Attached resources can then communicate between themselves in an isolated and secure layer 2 network, away from the public Internet.

Private Networks also have built-in **D**ynamic **H**ost **C**onfiguration **P**rotocol (DHCP), making it easy to manage the private IP addresses of your resources on the network.

Up to 512 resources can be attached to each Private Network, and each resource can be attached to up to eight Private Networks.

The following resource types can be attached to a Private Network:
- Instances
- Elastic Metal servers
- Kubernetes Kapsule (TODO; check)
- Load Balancers
- Public Gateways
- Managed Databases for PostgreSQL and MySQL
- Managed Databases for Redisâ„¢ (TODO: check)

## How to attach a resource to a regional Private Network

1. Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the side menu.

    A default VPC for each available region has been automatically created for you.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-vpc.webp" alt="" />

2. Click the **Default VPC** for your chosen region.

    A list of your regional Private Networks in this VPC displays.

3. Click the regional Private Network to which you want to attach resources.

    The regional Private Network's dashboard displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-rpn-dashboard.webp" alt="" />

4. Click the **Attached resources** tab.

    If you already have resources attached to the regional Private Network, a list of these displays. Otherwise, you see a welcome screen.

5. Click **+Attach resource**. The following screen displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-attach-resource.webp" alt="" />

6. Select the type of resource (Instance, Elastic Metal server etc.) that you want to attach. Then select the specific resource to attach. Only resources within the same region (or one of its Availability Zones) as the regional Private Network will be displayed.

7. Click **Attach resource** to finish.

    You are returned to the list of attached resources, where the newly-attached resource now displays.

## How to configure resources in a regional Private Network

Once you have attached a resource to a regional Private Network, it is necessary to configure the resource on the network (e.g. assign it a private IP address on the network).

There are different options for this:

- Use a [Scaleway Public Gateway](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#public-gateway) with DHCP enabled to dynamically assign IP addresses to resources as they join the network. You can also configure other features, such as NAT.
- Use a Scaleway Public Gateway without DHCP, configured as a standalone gateway for ingress/egress, with [IPAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address_management) (beta). See our [dedicated documentation](/network/vpc/api-cli/standalone-pgw-rpn/) to find out how to set up this functionality.
- Carry out configuration manually. See our documentation on [configuring Instances on Private Networks](/compute/instances/how-to/use-private-networks/#how-to-configure-the-private-network-interface-on-your-instances) for help with this.

## How to detach a resource from a regional Private Network

1. Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the side menu.

    A default VPC for each available region has been automatically created for you.

2. Click the **Default VPC** for the relevant region.

    A list of your regional Private Networks in this VPC displays.

3. Click the regional Private Network from which you want to detach resources.

    The regional Private Network's dashboard displays.

4. Click the **Attached resources** tab.

    A list of resources attached to the regional Private Network displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-attached-resource-list.webp" alt="" />

5. Click the <Icon name="unlink" /> icon next to the resource you want to detach.

6. Click **Detach resource** when prompted to confirm.
