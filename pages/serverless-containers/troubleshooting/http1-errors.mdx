## Problem

I get an `HTTP 426 Upgrade Required` error while using Serverless Containers.

## Cause
	
Scaleway Serverless Containers only supports **HTTP/1.1** and **HTTP/2**. Other protocols are not compatible.

## Solutions

- Send **HTTP/1.1** requests if you have control over the protocol to use when calling a Serverless Container.
- Deploy a layer in front of your container to translate HTTP/1.0 into HTTP/1.1.
