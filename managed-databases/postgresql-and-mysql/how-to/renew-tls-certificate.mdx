The creation and management of TLS certificates is a feature included in the Managed Database for PostgreSQL offers.

A certificate is generated automatically upon the creation of a Database Instance. You can renew your certificates at any time.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [PostgreSQL or MySQL Database Instance](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/quickstart)

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Click **Renew** under **TLS Certificate** in the **Database Instance Information** section. A pop-up appears.
4. Click **Renew TLS certificate** once you have read the warnings displayed and wish to continue.

    <Message type="important">
      Renewing a certificate means you:
        - Will not be able to connect to your Database Instance with the previous certificate when using the [verify-ca and verify-full](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/api-cli/verify-ca-postgresql).
        - Will need to download and update the new certificate for all database clients.
    </Message>

A green success message pops up in the top right corner of the screen to confirm the certificate has been renewed.
