An Edge Services **W**eb **A**pplication **F**irewall (WAF) evaluates requests to your Load Balancer origin to determine whether they are potentially malicious. You can choose the [paranoia level](/edge-services/concepts/#paranoia-level) to be used when evaluating requests, and set [exclusions](/edge-services/concepts/#exclusions) to define traffic that shouldn't be filtered by the WAF. Requests that are judged to be malicious are blocked or logged, depending on the settings you choose.

This page walks you through the processing of enabling and configuring WAF to protect your Load Balancer origin.

WAF is not available for Object Storage bucket origins.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An Edge Services pipeline for a [Load Balancer](/edge-services/how-to/create-pipeline-lb/) origin

## How to enable and configure WAF

1. In the Scaleway console, navigate to the Edge Services dashboard for the Load Balancer pipeline on which you want to enable WAF:
    TODO UPDATE
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-services-dashboard.webp" alt="A screenshot of the Edge Services dashboard in the Scaleway console. This is a dashboard for Edge Services on an Object Storage bucket, showing links to the documentation, Scaleway Cockpit, the endpoint, cache settings and a button to disable the pipeline." />

2. In the **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** panel, use the <Icon name="toggle" /> icon to enable WAF.

    A pop-up displays:

    TODO SCREENSHOT

3. Choose the **paranoia level**, from 1 - 4, that is best adapted to your use case. The higher the paranoia level, the more sensitive WAF is to potential threats, and the more likely it is to class a request as malicious. For help with choosing a paranoia level, see our [dedicated documentation](TODO).

        <Message type="tip">
        After enabling WAF, you will be able to [set exclusions](TODO) that filter out requests matching certain criteria from being evaluated by WAF.
        </Message>

4. Select a WAF **mode**. Requests judged to be malicious can either be **blocked** and prevented from passing to the Load Balancer origin, or **logged** but allowed to pass.

5. Click **Save**
