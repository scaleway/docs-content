## How to activate your Cockpit

Scaleway Cockpit is activated by default if you have created [Scaleway resources integrated with Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-limitations/#product-integration-into-cockpit).

## How to access the Grafana dashboard

To view your Serverless Functions logs, use the Grafana dashboard which is accessible from the Scaleway console:
  - First you must create a user and their associated credentials (a username and password) for Grafana.
  - Then use these credentials to access the Grafana dashboard for all your Scaleway products, via the Scaleway console.

1. Create a Grafana user and retrieve their username and password by following [this procedure](/observability/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/).

2. From the Scaleway console [Cockpit overview page](https://console.scaleway.com/cockpit/overview), click **Open dashboards** in the top right corner.

3. Enter your Grafana username and password to log in.

    You are directed to the Scaleway Cockpit dashboards homepage.

4. From the **Scaleway Dashboards** panel, select:
    - **Serverless Functions logs** to access the logs of your functions.
    - **Serverless Functions Overview** to access the metrics of your functions.

  You are directed to the selected dashboard. You can use the filters at the top of the page to refine the displayed information.
