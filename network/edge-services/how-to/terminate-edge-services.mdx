Edge Services is an additional feature for Scaleway Load Balancers and Object Storage buckets. It lets you benefit from a powerful caching service to reduce the load on your origin servers and streamline delivery. On top of this, you get a customizable Edge Services endpoint and can set it to a subdomain of your choice, securing it with an SSL/TLS certificate. To use Edge Services, you must subscribe to a monthly plan.

## How to terminate your Edge Services subscription

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An active [Edge Services subscription](/network/edge-services/how-to/subscribe-edge-services/)
- [Deleted all your Edge Services pipelines](/network/edge-services/how-to/delete-pipeline/)

You can terminate your Edge Services subscription at any time, as long as you have deleted all your pipelines. You will be charged pro-rata for the month you cancel, based on how much of that month your subscription was active.

1. Click **Edge Services** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. Your Edge Services dashboard displays.

2. Click the **Plans** tab. An overview of your current plan displays, along with options to manage your plan or terminate your subscription.

3. Scroll down to the **Terminate subscription** section, and click **Terminate subscription**. 

    A pop-up displays, asking you to confirm that you want to terminate your subscription.

4. Type **DELETE** in the box, and click **Terminate** to confirm.

    Your Edge Services subscription is terminated. You can subscribe again at any time.
