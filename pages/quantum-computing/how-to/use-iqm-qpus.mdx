**IQM Quantum Computers** is the European leader in building superconducting quantum computers. Headquartered in Finland, IQM provides on-premises quantum computers for supercomputing centers and research laboratories, as well as cloud access.

The technology is based on **superconducting transmon qubits**, the most established approach in the industry (similar to IBM or Google). These processors operate at near-absolute zero temperatures using dilution refrigerators. IQM's unique "co-design" strategy optimizes hardware for specific applications, but they also offer powerful general-purpose processors.

## How to access IQM with Scaleway
IQM quantum computers are accessible through multiple SDKs. [Please check SDK/Backend compatibility](/quantum-computing/additional-content/sdk-backend-compatibility).

The primary way to program IQM machines on Scaleway is through **Qiskit**. You do not need to learn a proprietary language; standard Qiskit circuits are fully compatible.

The integration is handled by the [Scaleway Provider for Qiskit](https://github.com/scaleway/qiskit-scaleway), which manages the translation of your circuits and their submission to the specific IQM backend.

The workflow below is identical to other gate-based providers on the platform. You connect using your credentials, select the specific IQM backend you want to target, and run your circuit.

<Message type="important">
  Currently, there are no specific high-performance GPU emulators (Digital Twins) available for IQM chips on the Scaleway Quantum Computing platform. Jobs are executed directly on the physical QPUs.

  Refer to the [IQM QPUs information page](/quantum-computing/additional-content/iqm-qpus) for more details.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account with a valid **Project ID**
- A Scaleway **API Key** (Secret Key)
- Python and `qiskit` installed on your local machine

1. Install the `qiskit-scaleway` provider. Refer to the [Qiskit Scaleway GitHub repository](https://github.com/scaleway/qiskit-scaleway) for more information.

    ```bash
    pip install qiskit-scaleway
    ```

2. Create a file with the following computation script. Replace `$SCW_PROJECT_ID` and `$SCW_SECRET_KEY` with your Scaleway Project ID and secret key.

    ```python
    from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
    from qiskit_scaleway import ScalewayProvider

    # 1. Connection credentials
    PROJECT_ID = "$SCW_PROJECT_ID"
    SECRET_KEY = "$SCW_SECRET_KEY"

    # 2. Initialize the Scaleway Provider
    provider = ScalewayProvider(
        project_id=PROJECT_ID,
        secret_key=SECRET_KEY
    )

    # 3. Select the Backend
    # - 'QPU-SIRIUS-24PQ' : Sirius real hardware (Paid per shot)
    # - 'QPU-GARNET-20PQ' : Garnet real hardware (Paid per shot)
    # - 'QPU-EMERALD-54PQ' : Emerald real hardware (Paid per shot)
    backend_name = "QPU-GARNET-20PQ"

    try:
        backend = provider.get_backend(backend_name)
        print(f"Connected to backend: {backend.name}")

        # 4. Create a Quantum Circuit (e.g., Bell State)
        # Note: IQM supports square-lattice connectivity, so you don't need to worry about coupling maps.
        qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
        qc.h(0)
        qc.cx(0, 1)
        qc.measure_all()

        # 5. No transpilation
        # Scaleway QaaS handles the transpilation server-side for you

        # 6. Execute the Job
        # Warning: On the real QPU, this line triggers billing.
        print("Submitting job...")
        job = backend.run(qc, shots=100)

        # 7. Retrieve Results
        result = job.result()
        print("Results:", result)

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
    ```

4. Save the script. In this example we save it as `iqm.py`.

5. Run the script.
    ```bash
    python ~/iqm.py
    ```

<Message type="tip">
  Always check the connectivity map (topology) of the specific QPU you are targeting, especially for Sirius, to optimize your circuit transpilation.
