This page shows you how to configure triggers for your functions. Triggers are configured during function deployment, and determine how and when the function will execute.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)

<Message type="important">
  It is possible to create triggers on private functions. But, if you want to **update** the privacy of a function from public to private, you will need to recreate the existing **SQS** and **NATS** triggers after the privacy change. We are actively working to make this operation as seamless as possible, but for now, you will need to recreate the triggers.

  Triggers send messages through a `POST` request with the message body in the request body.

## SQS triggers

[SQS triggers](/serverless/functions/concepts/#sqs-trigger) allow you to automatically invoke a function using events stored in a [queue](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#queue).

SQS queues of the [Scaleway Messaging and Queuing](/serverless/messaging/quickstart/) product are compatible with Serverless Functions.

The configuration of the queue retention may affect the behavior of the trigger. Refer to the [Considerations to configure event retention for trigger inputs](/serverless/functions/reference-content/configure-trigger-inputs/) page for more information.

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.
2. Click the relevant functions namespace.
3. Click the name of the function you want to manage. The function overview displays.
4. Click the **Triggers** tab. The trigger configuration displays.
5. Click **Create trigger**. The trigger creation form displays in a pop-up.
6. Enter a **name** for your trigger and select the **SQS (Scaleway)** type, then select your queue name.
7. Click **Create trigger** to launch trigger creation.

## CRON triggers

[CRON triggers](/serverless/functions/concepts/#cron-trigger) allow you to invoke your functions based on a recurring schedule.

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.
2. Click the relevant functions namespace.
3. Click the name of the function you want to manage. The function overview displays.
4. Click the **Triggers** tab. The trigger configuration displays.
5. Click **Create trigger**. The trigger creation form displays in a pop-up.
6. Enter a **name** for your trigger and select the **CRON** type.
7. Enter the cron schedule in UNIX format (`* * * * *`) and paste your JSON arguments in the form.
8. Click **Create trigger** to launch trigger creation.
