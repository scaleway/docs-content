## ASN

An **A**utonomous **S**ystem **N**umber (ASN) is a unique identifier assigned to a network or group of networks that operate under a single administrative domain, and use a common routing policy on the internet. When creating a customer gateway, you are asked to provide its ASN, to enable dynamic routing using [BGP](#bgp) across the VPN. Each BGP peer must have a unique ASN to identify its routing domain.
