This page shows you how to activate [traces](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#traces) from the Scaleway console, retrieve the traces push paths, configure the OpenTelemetry HTTP agent, and push traces.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
 - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
 - You have [activated your Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/how-to/activate-cockpit)
</Message>

## Activate traces

1. Click **Cockpit** in the Observability section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Cockpit** overview page displays.
2. Click the **APIs and Tokens** tab.
3. Click the **Activate traces** button. A pop-up displays.
4. Click **Activate traces** to confirm.

### Retrieve traces push paths

<Message type="important">
 During the beta of the traces feature, only the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/what-is-opentelemetry/) HTTP push path is supported. Scaleway is working on implementing the [Open Telemetry gRPC](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/rpc/grpc/), [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/) and [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.50/) protocols.
</Message>

Scaleway provides the following push path for the OpenTelemetry agent: `/otlp`.
The complete endpoint is `https://traces.cockpit.fr-par.scw.cloud/otlp`.

## Push traces

1. [Generate a token](/observability/cockpit/how-to/create-token/) with **Push** permissions for traces.
    <Message type="important">
     Once you have created your token, your secret key displays only once. Make sure you copy and save it before you exit the page.
    </Message>
2. Configure your applications to send traces to your [preferred endpoint](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#endpoints) using your newly-created token for authentication.
3. [Create your Grafana credentials](/observability/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/).
4. [Log in to your Grafana account](/observability/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards).
5. Create your [Grafana dashboard](/observability/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards) and start monitoring your data.
