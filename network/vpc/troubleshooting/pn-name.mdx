## TLD naming problem with Private Networks

If you have given your Private Network a name that is also a **T**op **L**evel **D**omain, you may experience SSL or addressing errors and conflicts when you try to access resources on the public internet with the same TLD as your Private Network, or when trying to reach resources on your Private Network from the public internet. Examples are:

- Errors when trying to reach  `google.dev` from a Private Network named `dev`
- Errors when trying to reach `scw.cloud.network` from a Private Network named `network`

## Solutions

Scaleway is working on a solution to allow users to name their Private Networks with a TLD name without experiencing any conflicts. In the meantime, until this solution is deployed, you should **not** give your Private Network a name that is also a TLD. 

- For a complete reference of TLDs to avoid, see the full list provided by [IANA](https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt)
- Giving a name that **uses** a TLD in combination with something else (e.g. `dev-123` or `cloud-sarah`) is OK, as long as the entire Private Network name is not the same as a TLD (e.g. `dev`, `cloud`)

You can change your Private Network name at any time in the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/):

1. In the side menu, click **VPC**.
2. Click the VPC containing the Private Network to rename.
3. Click the Private Network to rename.
4. Click the Private Network's name at the top of the screen, change it to a new name, and click <Icon name="validate" /> to confirm.

    <Message type="important">
    - After changing the name of Private Network, it can take up to an hour for the new name to be propagated. 
    - You should also renew DHCP leases in order to update the list of search domains for the Private Network: do this by running `netplan apply` on Ubuntu servers.
    - Note that resources in a Private Network are in any case always reachable by their IP address.
