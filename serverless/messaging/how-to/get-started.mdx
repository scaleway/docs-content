This page shows how to get started with Scaleway **NATS**, **Queues** or **Topics and Events** (previously grouped together as the **Messaging and Queuing** product). 

The process differs depending on the [messaging protocol](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#messaging-protocol) you want to use:

- For NATS, you need to **create a NATS account**.
- For **Queues** and **Topics and Events**, you no longer need to activate the protocol, but can proceed directly to [creating queues](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-queues) and/or [topics](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-topics).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to create a NATS account

To start using a NATS message broker, you must first create a NATS account. This sets a scope for your NATS credentials, messages, queues and stream.

1. Click **NATS** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. 

TODO CHECK STEPS

2. Select a [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) from the drop-down menu. The region designates the geographical area where the NATS account will be hosted.

3. Click **NATS**. The NATS welcome screen displays.

4. Click **Create a NATS account**. The creation wizard displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-nats-account.webp" alt="" />

5. Complete the following steps in the wizard:

    - Check the **region**, which is the geographical location in which your NATS account will be created. If you want to use a different region to the one shown, go back to step 2 to change it.
    - Enter a **name** for your NATS account, or use the auto-generated name suggested for you.
    - Optional: Use the *Estimated cost** calculator to simulate how messages sent and stored with NATS streams will be billed. Note that simply creating a NATS account does not in itself incur any billing. For more information about NATS billing, see the [FAQ](/faq/messaging-and-queuing/#how-is-messaging-and-queuing-billed).
    - Click **Create NATS account** to finish.

    You are directed to the listing of your NATS accounts, where your newly-created NATS account now appears.

    <Message type="tip">
    You can create more NATS accounts in your pre-selected region if you wish, by clicking on the `+ Create NATS account` button. To create NATS accounts in other regions, repeat the steps above starting from step 2 and selecting the required region.

## How to activate Queues or Topics and Events

For **Queues** and **Topics and Events**, you no longer need to activate the individual protocols. Proceed directly to [creating queues](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-queues) or [topics](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-topics) directly.
