For security reasons, SMTP ports are now blocked by default on every new Elastic Metal server delivered.
You can [enable them](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/elastic-metal/how-to/enable-smtp/) in the Scaleway console (through general settings) when your [identity is validated](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/console/my-account/how-to/verify-identity).
