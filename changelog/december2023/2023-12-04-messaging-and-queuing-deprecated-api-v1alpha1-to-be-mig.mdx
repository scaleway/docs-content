Effective December 1st 2023, the Messaging and Queuing v1alpha1 API has been deprecated and its resources and endpoints are no longer available. The v1beta1 APIs, available for Messaging and Queuing [SQS](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/messaging-and-queuing/sqs-api/), [SNS](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/messaging-and-queuing/sns-api/) and [NATS](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/messaging-and-queuing/nats-api/), must now be used going forward.
