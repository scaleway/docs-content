New features: Our CLI works with webassembly and uses your console credentials to offer you a CLI experience without requiring installation on your machine. Use the output formatting and discover how the CLI could be useful for you. You can also install it natively on your local machine, as we support Windows, macOS and Linux.

See our [product documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/developer-tools/scaleway-cli/quickstart/) for more information.
