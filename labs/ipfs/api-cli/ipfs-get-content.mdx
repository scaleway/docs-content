## Get your content from Kubo client

Once your content is pinned on our service, you can fetch it via any other [Kubo client](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/command-line/). It is Linux/Max/Windows compatible.

First, make sure your client is running:

```
ipfs init && ipfs daemon
```

then, just do as follow:

```
ipfs get <YOUR_PINNED_CID> > myFile
```

Your content will be stored into myFile.

## Get your content from an HTTP gateway

If you don't want to bother you with a local client, you can fetch public content via an IPFS gateway. Up to you, to use your web browser or curl.

```
curl https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<YOUR_PINNED_CID>
```

## Get your content from the go client

If you plan to fetch your pinned content via a go program, we recommand you to fetch the official [go-ipfs-api package](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-api).

In that case, you need to run an IPFS node (like Kubo) to perform operations with the IPFS network.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
  "os"

  ipfs "github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-api"
)

func main() {
	// Where your local node is running on localhost:5001
	sh := ipfs.NewShell("localhost:5001")
	err := sh.Get("<YOUR_PINNED_CID>", "myFile")
	if err != nil {
      fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "error: %s", err)
      os.Exit(1)
	}
}
```
