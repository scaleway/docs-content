Generative APIs offer seamless access to pre-configured, serverless endpoints of leading AI models.
No need to configure hardware or deploy your own models.

Hosted in European data centers and priced competitively per million tokens used, these APIs enable efficient and scalable integration of AI capabilities into your applications.

<Macro id="requirements" />

  - A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
  - A valid [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
  - Python 3.7+ installed on your system

## Start with the Generative APIs Playground

Scaleway provides a web playground for instruct-based models hosted on Generative APIs.

### Accessing the Playground
1. Navigate to **Generative APIs** under the **AI** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The list of models you can query displays.
2. Click the name of the chat model you want to try. Alternatively, click <Icon name="more" /> next to the chat model, and click **Try model** in the menu. 

The web playground displays.

### Using the playground
1. Enter a prompt at the bottom of the page, or use one of the suggested prompts in the conversation area.
2. Edit the hyperparameters listed on the right column, for example the default temperature for more or less randomness on the outputs. 
3. Switch models at the top of the page, to observe the capabilities of chat models offered via Generative APIs. 
4. Click **View code** to get code snippets configured according to your settings in the playground.

## Install the OpenAI Python SDK

To start using Generative APIs in your code, you can install the OpenAI Python SDK. Run the following command:

```sh
pip install openai
```

<Message type="tip">
  Ensure Python is installed on your local machine. If you need to install Python, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
</Message>

## Configure and set your API key and service URL

1. Have your [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) ready or generate a new one from the Scaleway console.
2. Use the following code in your Python script:

```py
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.scaleway.ai/v1", # # Scaleway's Generative APIs service URL
    api_key="<SCW_SECRET_KEY>" # Your unique API secret key from Scaleway
)
```

Make sure that you replace `<SCW_SECRET_KEY>` with the API key obtained from your Scaleway account.

<Message type="tip">
  It is recommended to store your API keys securely using environment variables or [secret management tools](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/) to prevent unauthorized access.
</Message>

## Send your first API request

You are now ready to make your first API request. Below is an example of generating a description of a futuristic city:

```py
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize the client with your base URL and API key
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.scaleway.ai/v1",
    api_key="<SCW_API_KEY>"
)

# Create a chat completion for Llama 3.1 8b instruct
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Describe a futuristic city with advanced technology and green energy solutions."}],
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=100
)

# Output the result
print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

This very simple example demonstrates how the Chat API can be used to generate creative content based on your prompts.

## Going further

Now that you are familiar with the basics, explore the full potential of Generative APIs by customizing your API requests. Refer to our [How-to guides](/ai-data/generative-apis/how-to/) for more advanced features and usage.
