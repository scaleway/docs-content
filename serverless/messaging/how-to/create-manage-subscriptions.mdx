This page shows how to create and manage SNS [subscriptions](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#subscription) with Scaleway Messaging and Queuing. When you create a subscription to a [topic](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#topic), you are effectively signing up an endpoint to receive all messages published to that topic.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An existing [topic](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-topics/)

## How to create a subscription

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of Messaging and Queuing protocols displays.

2. Use the dropdown menu to select the [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) of the topic you want to create a subscription for.

3. Click **SNS**, then navigate to the **Topics** tab and click the topic you want to create a subscription for.

4. Click **create subscription**. The subscription creation wizard displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-subscription.webp" alt="" />

5. Verify the parameters of the topic that you are creating a subscription for.

6. Choose a protocol, based on the type of endpoint or client you want to subscribe. Click the tab below for further details and full instructions on each protocol:

    <Tabs id="messaging-subscription-protocol">
        <TabsTab label="HTTP">
          <br />
          Select **HTTP** to create a subscription for a service or web server that can receive `HTTP POST` requests from SNS, via standard HTTP protocol.

          Note that for security reasons, we recommend using the HTTPS protocol, rather than HTTP.

          You are prompted to enter the URL of the HTTP endpoint to subscribe, e.g. `example.com`. Note that the scheme (`http://`) is not required.

          After your HTTP subscription is created, you must confirm it. Find out how in our [dedicated documentation](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-subscriptions/#how-to-confirm-an-http-or-https-subscription).

        </TabsTab>
        <TabsTab label="HTTPS">
          <br />
          Select **HTTPS** to create a subscription for a service or web server that can receive `HTTP POST` requests from SNS, via secure HTTP protocol.

          You are prompted to enter the URL of the HTTP endpoint to subscribe, e.g. `example.com`. Note that the scheme (`https://`) is not required.

          After your HTTP subscription is created, you must confirm it. Find out how in our [dedicated documentation](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-subscriptions/#how-to-confirm-an-http-or-https-subscription).
        </TabsTab>
        <TabsTab label="Serverless Functions and Containers">
          <br />
          Choose **Serverless Functions and Containers** to create a subscription for a Scaleway Serverless Function or Container that you have created.

          You are prompted to select the **namespace** containing the Function or Container that you want to subscribe. Only namespaces in the same [Project](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project) and [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) as the SNS topic can be selected.

          You are prompted to select the Serverless Function or Container to subscribe. Only Functions and Containers with a public [privacy policy](/serverless/functions/concepts/#privacy-policy) can subscribe to an SNS topic.
        </TabsTab>
    </Tabs>

7. Click **Create subscription** to finish.

    The subscription is created. If you created an HTTP or HTTPS subscription, you will now need to **confirm** it, as described below. This step is not required for Serverless Functions or Containers subscriptions.

## How to confirm an HTTP or HTTPS subscription

An HTTP or HTTPS subscription will have a `Pending` status until you **confirm** it. This is essential for it to be able to start receiving messages. Follow the steps below to confirm the subscription:

1. Access the subscription's **Settings** page (from the console side menu, **Messaging** > **SNS** > **Topics**, click the topic containing the subscription, then click the subscription).

2. Click the **Confirm Subscription** button at the top right of the page. A pop-up displays:

     <Lightbox src="scaleway-confirm-subscription.webp" alt="" />

3. Retrieve the confirmation message that Scaleway SNS sent to your endpoint (delivered as an `HTTP POST` request), and extract the `SubscribeURL` from the message payload.

4. Enter the `SubscribeURL` value (e.g. `https://sns.mnq.{region}.scaleway.com/?Action=ConfirmSubscription&TopicArn={your-topic-arn}&Token={your-subscription-token}`) in the box. The correct values for region, topic ARN and subscription token should be pre-filled for you in the URL.

5. Click **Confirm subscription**.

    You are returned to the subscription's **Settings** page, where its status is now shown as **Confirmed**. The subscription will now receive messages published to the topic.

## How to delete a subscription

When you no longer want a subscribed endpoint or service to receive messages from the topic, you can delete the subscription.

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of Messaging and Queuing protocols displays.

2. Use the drop-down menu to select the [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) containing the subscription you want to delete.

3. Click **SNS** > **Topics**, then click the topic containing the subscription you want to delete.

4. Click the **Subscriptions** tab. The list of subscriptions to this topic displays.

5. Either:
    - Click the subscription you wish to delete. The subscription's **Settings** page displays. Click the **Delete subscription** button in the bottom right corner.
    - Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the subscription you wish to delete, then select **Delete** from the menu that displays.

    A pop-up asks you to confirm that you understand this action will delete the subscription.

6. Type **DELETE** and click **Delete subscription**.
