Failover IPs are IP addresses that you can order and move from one server to another (even across datacenters), without changing your whole configuration. If your server is out of order, you can move the failover IP to your fallback server, and have your services remain available without any downtime. Failover IPs can also be used as additional IP addresses for a single server, for example if you want to give each website in Plesk its own IP. Another functionality of Failover IPs is to create virtual machines on your Dedibox.

## How to order a failover IP

1. Click **Server** in your Dedibox console to display a list of your dedicated servers. Then click on the server you want to configure.
2. On the server's status page click **Failover** in the menu on the left. 
3. The list of your existing failover IPs displays. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Order IP addresses**.
4. Select either an IP block or individual IP address and click **Command failover IP block** or **Command failover IP** for individual IPs.
5. Confirm the order by clicking **Order**.

## How to assign a failover IP

1. Click **Server** in your Dedibox console to display a list of your dedicated servers. Then click on the server you want to configure.
2. On the server's status page click **Failover** in the menu on the left. 
3. The list of your existing failover IPs displays. Drag and drop your failover IP from the list on the left to the ID of server you want to use as destination host. 
4. Click **Update** once you finish the failover IP destination configuration. 

    The failover IP will be routed to the new destination host within a few minutes.
