## Description

Attach a Serverless Function or Container to a Private Network.

### Availability

- Binding is done per Function or Container, not per namespace: multiple functions/containers in the same namespace can be attached to different PNs
- Works for both sandboxes (v1, v2)
- Feature is free of charge

### Features
Container to PN resources (egress)
Currently, no ingress (PN resources to container)
but container still available through public traffic

- All internal traffic (to PN) will be routed through the private interface, but external traffic (Internet) will be through the public (already existing) interface

- All DNS resolution is done through PN (using DNS server `169.254.169.254` (=VPC dns server)). This allows to resolve `*.internal` records




## Users limitations

### API

- A Function/Container can **only** be attached to a single PN
- extra quota for VPC via Containers (Container Unique Private Networks) 5/10
- UPDATE QUOTAS DOC



### Infrastructure

- **VPC routing** (custom routes) doesn't work yet

- Each Function/Container instance will have a unique IP in the PN, assigned by Scaleway. this implies:
  - it won't be possible for a user to **preemptively book an IP** in IPAM, and reference it in the attachment
  - this can result in a **large number of IPs** being used in the PN. It might be confusing for clients as a single resource (a given Function/Container) with multiple instances will have multiple IPs

- **Cold-starts will be slightly longer** due to the additional steps required to attach the node to the PN and book an IP.

Also, as of today, only ingress is implemented (phase 1: call a resource in the PN from a Function/Container). 

Egress (phase 2: calling a Function/Container from a resource in the PN) will be done [later](../#phases).
