An IAM application is a non-human user in an [Organization](#organization). This feature lets you create API keys that are not linked to a specific user, to give programmatic access to resources and make your production code more robust. As with users, you can define permissions and access rights for each IAM application via policies.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You are the Owner of your Organization, or an IAM user in an Organization where you have the relevant [permission set(s)](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/permission-sets). 
</Message>

1. Click **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** from the top-right of your [**Organization Dashboard**](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) in the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) displays.

3. Click the <Icon name="plus" /> button to create a new IAM application. The application creation wizard displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-app.webp" alt="" />
4. Complete the steps of the creation wizard:
    - Enter a name for the application, or use the auto-generated name suggested for you
    - Enter a description (optional)
    - Attach an existing policy to the application (optional)
    <Message type="note">
      You can choose not to attach a policy to the application at this stage. Unless your application is a part of a group, be aware that until you attach a policy to the application, it will have no permissions in your Organization.
    </Message>
5. Click **Create application** to finish.

    You are returned to the list of your applications, where your newly created application now appears.
