Outsourcing a Dedibox dedicated server means entrusting the technical management of your machines and services to another Scaleway Dedibox account while retaining control over your main account.

By outsourcing your servers, you grant permission to a third party to handle management on your behalf. This allows the designated Dedibox account holder access to all the necessary technical details of your Dedibox. However, they will not be able to view your billing information or make any changes to the services within your primary account. This ensures you maintain full control over your billing and service configurations while benefiting from external technical expertise.

  If you have multiple machines, you can outsource each of them individually to different users, if required.
