[Snapshots](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/concepts/#database-snapshot) allow you to restore data in a new Database Instance, instead of creating individual automated database backups. It is only available for Database Instances that use Block Storage volumes.

When you set up [autobackups](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/manage-backups/) for Database Instances that use Block Storage, the automatic backups are created in snapshot format.

You can create new Database Instances from a snapshot.

You can have up to 100 snapshots per Instance and Project (depending on quotas).

    </Message>
    A pop-up displays.
3. Enter a name for your snapshot and set up the expiration date and time.

## How to delete snapshots

When you delete an Instance, its associated snapshots are not deleted. Snapshots can be manually deleted or will be deleted after the retention period defined.

If you do not wish to wait for the snapshot to expire, you can delete it manually.

1. Go to the **Snapshots** tab of your Database Instance of choice.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the name of the snapshot.
3. Click **Delete**. A pop-up displays to warn you that:
    <Message type="important">
      This action is irreversible and will permanently destroy your snapshot and all its data.
    </Message>
4. Type **DELETE** and click **Delete snapshot** if you wish to continue.
