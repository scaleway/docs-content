The default rate limiting threshold has been significantly increased on all requests for all Regions to better support intensive workloads. 

For users who still reach the limit (429 error code), the process for asking for a rate limit upgrade remains unchanged, through [opening a support ticket](/console/account/how-to/open-a-support-ticket/).
