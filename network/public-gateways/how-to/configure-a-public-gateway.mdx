## How to attach a Public Gateway to a Private Network

1. Click **Public Gateways** in the **Networks** section of the side menu.
2. Click the Public Gateway that you want to attach to a Private Network. You are taken to the **Overview** page for that Public Gateway.
3. Click the **Private Networks** tab. A list of Private Networks attached to the Public Gateway displays. If no Private Networks are attached, the list will be empty.
4. Click <Icon name="plus" /> to attach a new Private Network to the Public Gateway. The following pop-up displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-vpc-gw-attach-pn.webp" alt="" />
5. Choose to attach an existing or a new Private Network.
    - If you want to attach an existing Private Network, select **Select and attach an existing Private Network** and choose the desired network from the drop-down list.
      <Message type="note">
        Note: Only Private Networks which are in the same Availability Zone as the Public Gateway are displayed in this list.
      </Message>
    - If you want to create and attach a new Private Network, select **Create and attach a new Private Network**. A default name will be suggested for you, but feel free to overwrite this with a new name of your choice.
    - Choose whether to **Enable** or **Disable** the DHCP server:
        - **Enable DHCP**: The Public Gateway will dynamically assign IP addresses to Instances in the Private Network. Enabling DHCP also enables the advertisement of a default route and DNS server through the Public Gateway. Both of these options can be disabled later.
        - **Disable DHCP**: None of the above functionalities will be applied.
    - Choose the subnet you would like to use for this network, e.g. `192.168.42.0/24`. You may find the note [here](/compute/instances/how-to/use-private-networks/) helpful if you are having difficulty choosing a subnet. Alternatively, click **Auto** to auto-generate a subnet, if you have enabled DHCP.
    - Choose whether to **Enable** or **Disable** Dynamic NAT:
        - **Enable Dynamic NAT**: Private IP addresses in the Private Network are automatically mapped to the public IP address of the Public Gateway, enabling automatic routing of egress traffic to and from multiple devices within the Private Network. Note: you will also be able to configure static NAT settings for ingress traffic.
        - **Disable Dynamic NAT**: The above functionality is not applied.
6. Click **Attach a Private Network** to finish. You are taken back to the Private Networks tab, where the network you attached now appears, along with the services configured and the IP address of the Public Gateway.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-vpc-gw-pn-attached.webp" alt="" />

Your Private Network is now attached to your Public Gateway. You can repeat the steps above to attach more Private Networks to the same Public Gateway if you wish.

## How to review and configure DHCP

You can review and (if you wish) modify the DHCP configuration of an existing Public Gateway as follows:

1. Click **Public Gateways** in the **Networks** section of the side menu.
2. Click the Public Gateway whose configuration you wish to modify. You are taken to the Overview page for that Public Gateway.
3. Click the **DHCP** tab. The following page displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-dhcp.webp" alt="" />
4. DHCP is configured per Private Network. Select a Private Network from the drop-down menu to review its configuration.
    - Toggle <Icon name="toggle" /> to **View DHCP Status** to view the current MAC/IP associations (aka DHCP leases).
    - Toggle <Icon name="toggle" /> to **Configure DHCP** and click <Icon name="edit" /> **Edit** to modify the network's DHCP configuration.
5. Modify the following configuration parameters according to your needs:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-dhcp-edit.webp" alt="" />

    - Enable or disable the DHCP server
    - Change the advertised subnet by specifying a subnet address with a mask. Click **Auto** to automatically compute a /24 subnet. The minimum subnet size is /28. The Public Gateway is assigned the first address of the subnet.
    - Enable or disable the advertisement of a default route through the Public Gateway
    - Enable or disable the advertisement of a DNS server. By default, the Public Gateway's IP address is specified, which allows Instance names to be resolved to their allocated IP addresses. You can also specify the address of a DNS server of your choice. Clicking **Auto** will reset this to the Public Gateway's IP address.
    - Modify the dynamic range used to dynamically assign IP addresses to devices on the network. This range should fall within the configured subnet and should not overlap with the static associations.
    - Create or delete static associations to assign IP addresses based on the MAC addresses of the Instance. Statically assigned IP addresses should fall within the configured subnet, but be outside the dynamic range.
6. Click <Icon name="validate" /> to save your configuration changes, or the red cross to cancel.
    <Message type="note">
      Newer Instances support DHCP auto-configuration, learning their IP address and the default route through the gateway automatically. However, older Instances may require manual configuration. You should refer to the documentation on [configuring Instances attached to a Public Gateway](/network/public-gateways/how-to/configure-instances-public-gw/) for further clarification on these points, and instructions for manual configuration.

<Message type="note">
  For services like DBaaS which requires a service IP, you can reserve one IP address in the DHCP pool by assigning it to a non existing MAC address.
  You can use the `00:00:00:00:00:00` MAC address for this purpose.

## How to review and configure NAT

You can review and (if you wish) modify the NAT configuration of an existing Public Gateway as follows:

1. Click **Public Gateways** in the **Networks** section of the side menu.
2. Click the Public Gateway whose configuration you wish to modify. You are taken to the Overview page for that Public Gateway.
3. Click the **NAT** tab. The following page displays, allowing you to review your NAT configuration:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-nat-tab.webp" alt="" />
4. In the **Dynamic NAT** panel, toggle <Icon name="toggle" /> Dynamic NAT on or off for each Private Network attached to this Public Gateway, as you wish.
5. In the **Static NAT** panel, click **Add Static NAT** to add a new configuration for any Private Network attached to this Gateway. The following screen displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-nat-add-static.webp" alt="" />
6. Add the following information for your new static NAT configuration:
    - **Protocol**: Choose TCP, UDP or Both from the drop-down menu
    - **Public Port**: Choose the Public Gateway port you want to use for this mapping
    - **Private IP address**: Enter the Private IP address of the Instance you want to map to. This should be included within one of the configured subnets of an attached Private Network. Usually, a static DHCP association is used too, to make sure this address does not change.
    - **Private Port**: Choose which of the Instance's ports you want to map to.
7. Click <Icon name="validate" /> to save your configuration changes, or <Icon name="cancel" /> to cancel.

    Your new static NAT configuration is now saved, and displays on the NAT panel. You can repeat steps 6-8 to add new static NAT configurations as you wish.

## How to enable SMTP

By default, the SMTP ports (25, 465, 587 and 2525) on your Public Gateway are blocked to avoid spam. If you wish to send emails from resources located behind your Public Gateway, make sure those resources [have also enabled SMTP](/compute/instances/how-to/send-emails-from-your-instance/) and then enable SMTP on your Public Gateway as follows:

1. Click **Public Gateways** in the **Networks** section of the side menu.
2. Click the Public Gateway whose configuration you wish to modify. You are taken to the **Overview** page for that Public Gateway.
3. Scroll down to the **SMTP** panel, and use the toggle <Icon name="toggle" /> to enable SMTP.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-enable-smtp.webp" alt="" />
