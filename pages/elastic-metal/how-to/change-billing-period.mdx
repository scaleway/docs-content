Scaleway's Elastic Metal servers offer flexible billing options to suit your needs. If you are currently using hourly billing, you can upgrade to monthly billing directly from the Scaleway console.
By switching to monthly billing, you can benefit from significant discounts compared to the hourly pricing model.
This provides you with cost savings for longer-term server rentals and allows you to retain your existing server configuration without requiring a new setup.

<Macro id="requirements" />
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Elastic Metal server](/elastic-metal/how-to/create-server/)

1. Click [Elastic Metal](https://console.scaleway.com/elastic-metal/servers) in the **Bare Metal** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Elastic Metal dashboard displays.
2. Click the server you want to configure. The server's information page displays.
3. Scroll down to the **Billing preferences** section. Here, you can see information about your current billing option. Click **Update to monthly billing**. A pop-up displays.
4. Review the server and optipons details and their new monthly pricing. Note that switching to monthly billing incurs a one-time commitment fee, which is charged immediately.
    <Message type="important">
        - Once switched to monthly billing, reverting to hourly billing is not possible.
        - A commitment fee is due immediately upon switching. This fee can be redeemed after 12 months as a voucher for other Scaleway services. [Learn more.](/elastic-metal/how-to/get-use-loyalty-reward/)

5. Tick the checkbox to acknowledge that the commitment fee will be debited immediately upon upgrading.
6. Confirm the new billing period by clicking **Update billing**.
    <Message type="note">
      Switching from hourly to monthly may take a few minutes, during which the server will be in a `migrating` state.
