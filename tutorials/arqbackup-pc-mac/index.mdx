**Arq Backup** automatically backs up Macs and PCs to cloud storage while encrypting the data in an [open and documented format](https://www.arqbackup.com/arq_data_format.txt).

In this tutorial you learn how to back up your PC or Mac computer to Object Storage using Arq Backup, using version 7 of the application.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Object Storage bucket](https://www.scaleway.com/en/object-storage/)

## Installing and configuring Arq Backup

1. Open your web browser and go to the [Arq website](https://www.arqbackup.com/index.html) and download the application for your operating system.
2. Double-click the downloaded file to open the setup tool. Follow the instructions given by the setup wizard to complete the installation of the application.
3. Start the Arq application once it is installed. Enter your license code or start the free trial:

4. Validate the terms of service to use the application:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-arq7_license.webp" alt="" />
5. Gain full disk access to the application, so it can back up the entire disk of your computer:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-arq7_disk_access.webp" alt="" />

  The main window displays.
6. Click **Create a backup plan** to add a new backup endpoint:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-arq7_create_backup.webp" alt="" />
7. Select **S3-Compatible Server** as storage location and click **OK**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-arq7_s3.webp" alt="" />
8. Enter the Object Storage credentials:
    - **Server URL:** The URL of the Object Storage endpoint:
      - For FR-PAR (Paris, France) enter `https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud`
      - For NL-AMS (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) enter `https://s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud`
      - For PL-WAW (Warsaw, Poland) enter `https://s3.pl-waw.scw.cloud`
    - **Access key ID:** The [access key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) of the API key used for authentication
    - **Secret key:** The [secret key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) of the API key used for authentication
    - **Region**: The region of your Object Storage bucket (`fr-par`, `nl-ams`, or `pl-waw`)

9. Choose the bucket for storing backups. Two options are proposed:
    - Create a new bucket
    - Choose an existing bucket from the drop-down list
10. Create the new backup plan using the previously configured storage location. Click **Continue** to confirm:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-arq7_choose_storage.webp" alt="" />
11. Configure an optional password to increase the security of your backups. You will need this password to decrypt your data. Tick the checkbox and enter your password and its confirmation, then click **Continue** to confirm:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-arq7_password.webp" alt="" />

    <Message type="important">
      Make a note of the password and keep it in a safe place. It is not possible to decrypt a backup without having the password. You can restore backups using the Arq Backup application, or an open source [restore tool](https://arqbackup.github.io/arq_restore/).
    </Message>

    A summary of your configuration displays.
12. Click **Create** to validate the settings and to create the new backup plan:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-arq7_summary.webp" alt="" />

    The status of the new backup plan displays. By default, Arq makes an hourly backup of the entire disk of your computer: 
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-arq7_status.webp" alt="" />

    If required, the backup frequency and the files and folders to back up can be adjusted from the backup plan preferences by clicking on **Edit** in the plan details:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-arq7_edit_plan.webp" alt="" />

### Restoring Files

1. Go to the **Restore Files** section of Arq
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-arq7_restore.webp" alt="" />
2.  Expand the menu on the left to see a list of all backups. They are sorted by the time/date of their creation. Click the desired backup, and the contents of the backup appear on the right.
    - Click the Item to restore, then click the **Restore...** button.
    - Choose if you want to restore the item in its original location, on the desktop, or in another specific location. Tick the checkbox if you want to overwrite existing files, then click **Restore**.
    - Arq may prompt for an administrator username and password to avoid permission issues when restoring files.

    Alternatively it is possible to restore files anywhere by dragging-and-dropping them from the backup window to the desktop or a Finder window
