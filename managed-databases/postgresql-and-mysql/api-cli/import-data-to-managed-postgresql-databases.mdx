Managed Databases for PostgreSQL offers near-complete PostgreSQL compatibility, and allows you to import your data from any PostgreSQL-compatible database.

<Message type="important">
The methods listed below are best suited for database sizes below 100 GB (approx.). Above this size, we recommend you use dedicated tooling to import your data, as your local storage size and bandwidth will create bottlenecks, and the operation may last several hours.

## Importing data from an existing PostgreSQL database

### Using pg_dump

#### Prerequisites

To complete this procedure, you must have installed PostgreSQL in a version compatible with your target Managed PostgreSQL, with [pg_dump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html) and [pg_restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgrestore.html) (bundled with the default PostgreSQL installation).

#### Downloading and importing data into a Managed Database for PostgreSQL

1. Run the following command to download a local export of your database with `pg_dump`, then enter your password when prompted:

    ```
    pg_dump --no-privileges --no-owner -U {username} -h {host} --port {port} -Fc {databasename} > my-backup
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
    You can download specific tables using the `-t` option:

      ```
      pg_dump -t table1name -t table2name --no-privileges --no-owner -U {username} -h {host} --port {port} -Fc {databasename} > my-backup
      ```
    </Message>

2. When finished, make sure the backup is downloaded on your local machine. The default location is in the current directory, under `/my-backup`.

3. Run the command below to import data into your Managed Database for PostgreSQL using `pg_restore`. Make sure to replace the placeholders with your Managed Database for PostgreSQL connection parameters:

    ```
    pg_restore --no-privileges --no-owner --clean --if-exists -U {username} -h {host} --port 5432 -d {databasename} my-backup
    ```

    <Message type="note">
    You can find this information on the [overview page](https://console.scaleway.com/rdb/instances) of your database.
    </Message>

4. Enter the database password you defined upon [Database Instance creation](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/create-a-database/) when prompted.

5. When finished, make sure your data is stored in your new database by [connecting to it](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/connect-database-instance/), and performing a query.

### Using pgAdmin

#### Prerequisites

To complete the following procedure, you must have:

- Installed [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/).

- Ensured your pgAdmin version is compatible with the PostgreSQL version of the database you will import your data into. Refer to the official [pgAdmin documentation](https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/7.8/release_notes.html) to check the compatibility.

#### Downloading the backup on your local machine

1. Open pgAdmin.

2. Connect to your existing database server by selecting it in the left-hand menu.

3. In the **Databases** submenu, connect to the database you want to export by selecting it.

4. Right-click the database you want to export in the left-hand menu, and select **Backup**.

5. Enter a name for the backup file (e.g. `my-backup`), and keep the default **format** and **compression** options.

6. Click **Backup**. The backup creation process starts, and you can follow its progress by clicking **View processes**.

7. When finished, make sure your backup is downloaded on your local machine. By default, the backup location is `Users/{username}/my-backup` on MacOS.

#### Loading your data in your Managed Database for PostgreSQL

1. Register your new database in pgAdmin. Refer to the [How to connect to a Managed Database for PostgreSQL](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/connect-database-instance/) documentation page for more information.

2. Connect to your database server by selecting it in the left-hand menu.

3. Select your database in the **Databases** submenu.

4. Right-click the database you want to export in the left-hand menu, then select **Restore**.

5. Enter the file name of your backup (e.g. `my-backup`), and keep the default options.

6. Access the **Data options** tab, and enable the **Do not save - Owner** and **Do not save - Privileges** options.

7. (Optional) If your new database is not empty, access the **Query Options** tab, and enable the **Clean before restore** option.

    <Message type="tip">
    This option ensures that your database is emptied before loading data to avoid potential conflicts with existing data (such as table names or primary key constraints).
    </Message>

8. Click **Restore**. The restore process starts, and you can follow its progress by clicking **View processes**.

9. When finished, make sure your data is stored in your new database by [connecting to it](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/connect-database-instance/), and performing a query.

If the process fails and some data was already partly transferred, we suggest that you activate the **Clean before restore** option in the **Data options** tab to remove partly transferred data.

### Using Airbyte

</Message>

### Using Meltano

Tools such as [Meltano](https://meltano.com/) are better suited to load data only, without keeping constraints on column types or relations. To load all PostgreSQL objects (such as table constraints, users, etc.), we recommend using other tools such as [pg_dump and pg_restore](#using-pgdump).

#### Prerequisites

To complete the following procedure, you must have:

- Installed [Meltano](https://docs.meltano.com/getting-started/installation/)

#### Initializing your Meltano project

1. In a terminal, run the command below to initialize a Meltano project named `migrate-postgresql`:

    ```sh
    meltano init migrate-postgresql
    ```

2. Run the following command to access the newly created directory that contains the project:

    ```sh
    cd migrate-postgresql
    ```

3. Run the following command to add a PostgreSQL-compatible extractor and loader:

    ```sh
    meltano add extractor tap-postgres
    meltano add loader target-postgres
    ```

#### Configuring the extractor to connect to your existing database

1. Run the command below to configure the connection to your existing database:

    ```sh
    meltano config tap-postgres set --interactive
    ```

    A list of settings displays, with a number associated with each parameter.

2. Fill in the required information below by entering the number associated with each parameter:

    - **Database Name** (5)
    - **Host** (13)
    - **Password** (14)
    - **Port** (15)
    - **Username** (32)

3. Select the tables you want to load:

    ```
    meltano select tap-postgres {schema-name}-{table1name}
    meltano select tap-postgres {schema-name}-{table2name}
    ...
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
    For instance `meltano select tap-postgres public-cities` if you are importing the table `cities` from the schema `public`.
    You can check the selected tables and columns with `meltano select tap-postgres --list --all`.
    </Message>

#### Configuring the loader to connect to your new Managed Database for PostgreSQL

1. Run the command below to configure the connection to your existing database:

    ```sh
    meltano config tap-postgres set --interactive
    ```

    A list of settings displays, with a number associated with each parameter.

2. Fill in the required information below by entering the number associated with each parameter:

    - **Database Name** (5)
    - **Host** (13)
    - **Password** (14)
    - **Port** (15)
    - **Username** (32)

    <Message type="note">
    You can find this information on the [overview page](https://console.scaleway.com/rdb/instances) of your database. These are the username and password that you defined upon Database Instance creation.
    </Message>

#### Executing the data import and loading

1. Run the following command to execute the data import and loading:

    ```sh
    meltano run tap-postgres target-postgres
    ```

2. When finished, make sure your data is stored in your new database by connecting to it, and performing a query.

    <Message type="note">
    By default, the `tap-postgres` extractor loads data in the `tap_postgres` schema, rather than the `public` schema. You can find your loaded tables with the following command:

    ```
    SELECT * from tap-postgres.{table1name} LIMIT 10;
    ```
    </Message>

## Importing data from an existing PostgreSQL backup

### Using pg_restore

#### Prerequisites

To complete the following procedure, you must have:

- Installed PostgreSQL 15 (or older) with [pg_restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgrestore.html) (bundled with the default PostgreSQL installation).

- A backup file for your database (named `my-backup` in the following procedure).

1. In a terminal, access the directory containing the backup file, then run the command below to import data to your Managed Database for PostgreSQL using `pg_restore`. Make sure to replace the placeholders with your Managed Database for PostgreSQL connection parameters:

    ```
    pg_restore --no-privileges --no-owner --clean --if-exists -U {username} -h {host} --port 5432 -d {databasename} my-backup
    ```

    <Message type="note">
    You can find this information on the [overview page](https://console.scaleway.com/rdb/instances) of your database. These are the username and password that you defined upon Database Instance creation.
    </Message>

2. When finished, make sure your data is stored in your new database by [connecting to it](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/connect-database-instance/), and performing a query.

## Import Data from a file (.csv, .txt, etc.)

### Using psql

#### Prerequisites

To complete the following procedure, you must have:

- Installed PostgreSQL in a version compatible with your target Managed PostgreSQL, with [pg_restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgrestore.html) (bundled with the default PostgreSQL installation).

- A data file corresponding to a single table (named named `my-table.csv` in the following procedure).

<Message type="tip">
You can create a `.csv` file from an existing PostgreSQL table with the [COPY TO command](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html), as shown below:

```sql
\COPY {tablename} TO './my-table.csv' WITH DELIMITER ',' CSV;
```
</Message>

1. In a terminal, access the folder containing your data file:

    ```
    cd path/to/my-table.csv
    ```

2. Connect to your Managed Database for PostgreSQL using `psql`:

    ```sh
    psql "postgresql://{username}:{password}@{host}:5432/{databasename}?sslmode=require"
    ```

    <Message type="note">
    You can find this information on the [overview page](https://console.scaleway.com/rdb/instances) of your database. These are the username and password that you defined upon Database Instance creation.
    </Message>

3. Create the table structure corresponding to your file column types:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE {tablename} (column1name type1, column2name type2, ...);
   ```

4. Run the command below to load your data to your Managed Database for PostgreSQL using the [psql \copy command](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html#APP-PSQL-META-COMMANDS-COPY):

    ```sql
    \copy {tablename} FROM './my-table.csv' WITH DELIMITER ',' CSV;
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      The PostgreSQL [COPY command](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html) cannot be used directly, as it requires the source file to be available on the PostgreSQL instance itself.
    </Message>

5. When finished, make sure your data is stored in your new database by [connecting to it](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/connect-database-instance/), and performing a query.
