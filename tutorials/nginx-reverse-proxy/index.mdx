A [Nginx HTTPS reverse proxy](https://nginx.org) is an intermediary proxy service which takes a client request, passes it on to one or more servers, and subsequently delivers the serverâ€™s response back to the client. While most common applications are able to run as web server on their own, the Nginx web server is able to provide a number of advanced features such as load balancing, TLS/SSL capabilities and acceleration that most specialized applications lack. By using a Nginx reverse proxy all applications can benefit from these features.

There are a important benefits of setting up a Nginx HTTPS reverse proxy:

- **Load Balancing:** A Nginx reverse proxy can perform load balancing which helps distribute client requests evenly across backend servers. It also improves redundancy as if one server goes down, the reverse proxy will simply reroute requests to a different server according to the routing policy.
- **Increased Security:** A Nginx reverse proxy also acts as a line of defense for your backend servers. Configuring a reverse proxy ensures that the identity of your backend servers remains unknown.
- **Better Performance:** Nginx has been known to perform better in delivering static content file and analyse URLs
- **Easy Logging and Auditing:** Since there is only one single point of access when a Nginx reverse proxy is implemented, this makes logging and auditing much simpler.
- **Encrypted Connection** By encrypting the connection between the client and the Nginx reverse Proxy with TLS, users profit from a encrypted and securized HTTPS connection, protecting their data.

- You have a web application running on a non-standard web port on the instance (You can for example install a lightweight web server like [Webfsd](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/webfsd.1.html), which runs on port 8000 by default to be reachable on the standard HTTP(s) ports via the proxy.)

## Installing and Configuring Nginx

In the following example, we will configure an Nginx reverse proxy in front of an Apache web server. As a result, we assume that Apache is already installed and configured (on the same machine).

1. Update the APT packet cache and install the Nginx web server via the packet manager:

  ```
  apt update
  apt install nginx
  ```

2. Disable the default virtual host, that is pre-configured when Nginx is installed via Ubuntu's packet manager apt:

  ```
  unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
  ```

3. Enter the directory `/etc/nginx/sites-available` and create a `reverse proxy` configuration file.

  ```
  cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
  nano reverse-proxy.conf
  ```

4. Paste the following Nginx configuration in the text editor. The proxy server redirects all incomming connections on port 80 to the Webfsd server, listening on port 8000. Edit the port value depending on the applications specific port.

  ```
  server {
          listen 80;
          listen [::]:80;

          access_log /var/log/nginx/reverse-access.log;
          error_log /var/log/nginx/reverse-error.log;

          location / {
                      proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
    }
  }
  ```

  <Message type="note">
  
    Accesses and errors are located in a log files at `/var/log/nginx`.

  </Message> 

5. Copy the configuration from `/etc/nginx/sites-available` to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`.
   It is recommended to use a symbolic link.

    ```
    ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/reverse-proxy.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/reverse-proxy.conf
    ```

6. Test the Nginx configuration file

  ```
  nginx -t
  ```
  ```
  nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
  nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
  ```

7. Open a web browser on your local computer and paste your `public_ip` which will display your web applications homepage.

## Adding TLS to your Nginx Reverse Proxy using Let's Encrypt

> **Important:** Make sure your domain name points towards your server ip (A or AAAA record).

With the current setup, all incoming traffic on the standard, non-securized, HTTP port is anserwered by Nginx, which passes it to the web application on the instance.

For security reasons, it is recommended to add an encryption layer with TLS/SSL and to use HTTPS. Whilst it is technically possible to use self-signed certficates, it may cause very inconveniences as a warning is displayed by default in an users web browser when a self-signed certificate is used. A certificate authentity (CA) can issue trusted certificates which a recognized by most modern web browsers. The CA [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) provides TLS certificate for free and the configuration of Nginx can be done easily with [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/), a tool provided by the [EFF](https://www.eff.org/).

1. Install Certbot on your instance by using the APT packet manager:

  ```
  apt-get update
  apt-get install software-properties-common
  add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
  apt-get update
  apt-get install python-certbot-nginx
  ```

2. Certbot provides a plugin designed for the Nginx web server, automatizing most of the configuration work related with requesting, installing and managing the TLS certificate:

  ```
  certbot --nginx
  ```

3. Answer the prompts that display on the screen to request a valid Let's Encrypt TLS certificate:

    ```
    Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
    Plugins selected: Authenticator nginx, Installer nginx

  <Message type="note">

  When asked if you want to redirect HTTP traffic automatically to HTTPS, choose the option **2**. This enables the automatic redirection of all incoming requests via an unencrypted HTTP connection to a secure HTTPS connection. Providing an additional layer of security for the Web application running behind the Nginx reverse proxy.
