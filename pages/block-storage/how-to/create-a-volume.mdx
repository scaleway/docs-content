import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'


<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

1. Click **Block Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The Block Storage page displays.
2. Click **+ Create volume**.
3. Follow the steps in the creation wizard:
    - Choose the same [Availability Zone](/instances/concepts/#availability-zone) as the Instance you want to attach your block to.
    - Configure the volume:
        - Enter a name for your volume or leave the automatically generated name.
        - Select an [IOPS](/block-storage/concepts/#iops) option. You cannot edit the IOPS of a volume after its creation.
        <Message type="note">
          To use **Block Storage Low Latency 15k**, your Instance must have at least **3 GiB/s of block bandwidth**.
          You can verify if an Instance type meets this requirement by consulting the [Scaleway Instances internet and Block Storage bandwidth overview](/block-storage/reference-content/block-instances-bandwidth-overview/) documentation.  

          Alternatively, use the [Instances API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/#path-instance-types-list-instance-types) to check the `block_bandwidth` field at `/instance/v1/zones/{zone}/products/servers`.  
          This field provides detailed information about block bandwidth for each Instance type, helping you ensure compatibility with high-performance storage.

        - Define a volume size of at least 5 GB.
    - Optionally, select an Instance from the drop-down to attach your volume.
    - Verify the estimated cost.
4. Click **Create volume**. The volumes overview page displays.
