Each function comes with an automatically generated domain on which it is available. However it is possible to use your own domain name to address your functions to facilitate their use.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- A running [Serverless Function](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/functions/how-to/deploy-a-function/)
- A domain name 

</Message>

1. Add a CNAME pointing to your function default URL from the [domains dashboard](/network/dns-cloud/how-to/manage-dns-records/).
2. Click the **Endpoints** tab on your Functions' page.

3. Click **+ Add a New Endpoint**.
4. Enter your custom URL and validate the form.

Connect to your function using your custom domain once you have checked the CNAME and TLS fields.
