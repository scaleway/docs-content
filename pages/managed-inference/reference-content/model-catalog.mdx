### Gemma-3-27b-it
Gemma-3-27b-it is a model developed by Google to perform text processing and image analysis on many languages.
The model was not trained specifically to output function / tool call tokens. Hence function calling is currently supported, but reliability remains limited.

#### Model names
```
google/gemma-3-27b-it:bf16
```
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Supported image formats | PNG, JPEG, WEBP, and non-animated GIFs |

### Mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct-2503
Mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct-2503 is a model developed by Mistral to perform text processing and image analysis on many languages.
This model was optimized to have a dense knowledge and faster tokens throughput compared to its size.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Supported images formats | PNG, JPEG, WEBP, and non-animated GIFs |
| Maximum image resolution (pixels) | 1540x1540 |
| Token dimension (pixels)| 28x28 |

#### Model names
```
mistral/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct-2503:bf16
```

- Bitmap (or raster) image formats, meaning storing images as grids of individual pixels, are supported. Vector image formats (SVG, PSD) are not supported, neither PDFs nor videos.
- Images size are limited in the following ways:
  - Directly by the maximum context window. As an example, since tokens are squares of 28x28 pixels, the maximum context window taken by a single image is `3025` tokens (ie. `(1540*1540)/(28*28)`)
  - Indirectly by the model accuracy: resolution above 1540x1540 will not increase model output accuracy. Indeed, images above 1540 pixels width or height will be automatically downscaled to fit within 1540x1540 dimension. Note that image ratio and overall aspect is preserved (images are not cropped, only additionaly compressed).

### Pixtral-12b-2409
Pixtral is a vision language model introducing a novel architecture: 12B parameter multimodal decoder plus 400M parameter vision encoder.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|

| Maximum image resolution (pixels) | 1024x1024 |
| Token dimension (pixels)| 16x16 |
| Maximum images per request | 12 |

#### Model name

### Sentence-t5-xxl
The Sentence-T5-XXL model represents a significant evolution in sentence embeddings, building on the robust foundation of the Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) architecture.
Designed for performance in various language processing tasks, Sentence-T5-XXL leverages the strengths of T5's encoder-decoder structure to generate high-dimensional vectors that encapsulate rich semantic information.
This model has been meticulously tuned for tasks such as text classification, semantic similarity, and clustering, making it a useful tool in the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) framework. It excels in sentence similarity tasks, but its performance in semantic search tasks is less optimal.
