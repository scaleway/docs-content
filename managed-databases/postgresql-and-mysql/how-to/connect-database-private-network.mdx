[Private Networks](/network/vpc/concepts/#private-networks) allows you to enhance the security of your system's architecture by isolating it from the internet.

When using Private Networks, your application connects directly to your Database nodes without going through a Load Balancer.

This improves performance by reducing the latency between your application and your database nodes. It also increases the security of your databases, as Instances in your Private Network can directly communicate with your Database Instance, without passing through the public internet.

You can create new Database Instances to attach to your Private Network, or attach existing ones.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
- A [PostgreSQL or MySQL Database Instance](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/quickstart)

## How to attach a Database Instance to a Private Network

  <Message type="note">
      You can only attach your Database Instance to one Private Network at a time.
  </Message>

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Scroll to the **Network** section.
    <Message type="note">
      Alternatively, you can follow the next steps from the **Private Networks** tab. Click **+ Attach to a Private Network** to open the configuration pop-up.
    </Message>
4. Click **Attach Private Network** next to **Private endpoint**. A pop-up appears.
5. Choose whether to:
    - Select and attach an existing Private Network and select the network from the drop-down list.
        <Message type="important">
          The Database Instance must be attached to a Private Network in the same region.
        </Message>
    - Create and attach a new Private Network and enter the name of the network in the form.
        <Message type="important">
          If you select this option, a Private Network with default settings will be created in the same region as your Database Instance. Do not use a TLD (e.g. dev, cloud) as a name, to avoid conflicts.
        </Message>

    <Message type="note">
      Your private IP addresses are automatically allocated. They are managed via an IP Address Manager (IPAM). You can retrieve them on the Private Network tab of your Database Instance. To allocate IPs manually, you can use the Scaleway API and CLI, or Terraform.
    </Message>
6. Click **Attach to Private Network** to conclude.

<Message type="important">
Managed Databases for PostgreSQL and MySQL are currently not compatible with the [Static NAT](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#nat) feature of [Scaleway Public Gateways](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#public-gateway).

You can use Public Gateways in [SHH bastion](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/network/public-gateways/how-to/use-ssh-bastion/) mode and perform port forwarding.
</Message>

<Message type="tip">
  If you are using Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule, you can use the [scaleway-k8s-vpc](https://github.com/Sh4d1/scaleway-k8s-vpc) GitHub project to connect a Database Instance to your pods using a Private Network.<br /><br />
  Once your Kapsule node is connected to the Private Network you can directly reach the database by using the assigned service IP. There is no need to expose it through a Kubernetes resource like a service. The database is ready to use out of the box. <br /><br />
  **The `scaleway-k8s-vpc` is not an officially supported by Scaleway.**

## How to detach a Database Instance from a Private Network

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Click the **Private Networks** tabs. The Private Network configuration displays.
4. Click <Icon name="unlink" /> next to the static IP that you want to unlink from your Database Instance.
5. Click **Detach resource** to remove the Instance from your Private Network.

<Message type="note">
This action takes a few moments to complete. During this time, your Database Instance:
  - remains available,
  - goes into **Configuring** mode, and
  - network configuration actions become unavailable
