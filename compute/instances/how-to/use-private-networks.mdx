[Private Networks](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#private-network) allow your Instances to communicate in an isolated and secure network without needing to be connected to the public Internet. Each Instance can be connected to one or several Private Networks, letting you build your own network topologies. 

Private Networks are LAN-like layer 2 ethernet networks. A new network interface with a unique media access control address (MAC address) is configured on each Instance in a Private Network. Private Networks' built-in DHCP server manages the allocation of private IP addresses for Instances (and other resources) when they are attached to the network.

## How to create a Private Network

TODO CHECK THIS AND ADD NOTE ABOUT DEFAULT CIDR
1. Click **Instances** (A) in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Instances page displays.
2. Click the Instance you want to add a Private Network to.
3. Click the **Private Networks** tab. 
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-private-networks.webp" alt=""/>
4. Click the **Attach to a Private Network** button. A pop-up displays.
5. Select **Create and attach a new Private Network**
6. Enter a **Name** for your Private Network, or leave the randomly-generated name in place.
7. Click **Attach to a Private Network** to finish. Your Private Network is created. You are taken back to the Private Networks tab, where your new Private Network is now displayed in the list.
  
## How to attach Instances to a Private Network

TODO CHECK THIS AND ADD NOTE ABOUT VIEWING IP ADDRESSES
1. Navigate to the **Private Networks** tab (click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu, then click **Private Networks**)
2. Click the Private Network you want to add Instances to.

    You are taken to the **Overview** page for that network.

    You are taken back to the **Attached resources** tab, where the Instance you just added displays in the list along with its associated MAC address.

## How to detach Instances from a Private Network

TODO CHECK THIS
1. Navigate to the **Instances** tab of the Private Network in question (see steps 1-3 [above](/compute/instances/how-to/use-private-networks/#how-to-create-a-private-network)). The list of Instances attached to this Private Network displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-pn-detach-inst.webp" alt=""/>
2. Click the **unlink** button next to the Instance you wish to detach from the Private Network. A pop up displays, asking you to confirm.
3. Click **Detach this Instance**.

    You are taken back to the Instances tab, where the Instance you just detached is now removed from the list.

## How to delete a Private Network

<Message type="note">
  Prior to deleting a Private Network, all Instances attached to the network have to be [detached](/compute/instances/how-to/use-private-networks/#how-to-detach-instances-from-a-private-network).
</Message>

1. In the **Network** section of the side menu, go to **Private Networks**. A list of your **Private Networks** displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more"/> next to the Private Network you want to delete, then click **Delete**. A pop-up displays.
3. Confirm by typing **DELETE** in the box, and clicking **Delete Private Network**

    You are taken back to the **Private Networks** tab, where the network you just deleted no longer displays.
