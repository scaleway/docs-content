You may be attempting to delete a Private Network VPC via the Scaleway console, API, or other developer tool, and see one of the following error messages:

- `resource_still_in_use`
- `Detach resources from this Private to delete it`
- `Private Network must be empty to be deleted`
- `precondition failed: resource_still_in_use`

## Cause

If your Private Network has no attached resources (Instances, Elastic Metal servers etc), this error is probably due to a private IP address being reserved for the Private Network in IPAM.

## Solution

You must release the reserved private IPs from IPAM in order to delete the Private Network.

In the [IPAM section](https://console.scaleway.com/ipam/) of the Scaleway console, use the filters to select the region and VPC of your Private Network. If there are any private IPs reserved for the Private Network, release them.

<Message type="tip">
If you cannot see any reserved IPs in IPAM, check again that you have correctly used the **filters** to display reserved IPs for a given region / VPC / Private Network. In the console, IPAM shows **only** reserved IPs for the selected filters. There is no overview of all reserved IPs across all your Private Networks.
