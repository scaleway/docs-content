We have completely redesigned the backend management experience in the console:
- The Load Balancer creation process has been streamlined
- The backend management pages have been completely reorganized to provide a clearer and more consistent experience
- You now have access to many backend configuration settings that were previously only available through API

On top of this we have taken the opportunity to introduce 2 new features:
- [Backend protection](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/network/load-balancer/reference-content/configuring-backends/#backend-protection/) allows limiting the number of sessions on backend servers
- [Backend retry logic](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/network/load-balancer/reference-content/configuring-backends/#retries/) allows fine tuning how to retry failed connections to backend servers

For more information you can have a look at our updated [reference documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/network/load-balancer/reference-content/).
