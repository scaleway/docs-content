To create a Site-to-Site VPN, you must create several individual elements and then join them together:

1. **Create a VPN gateway**, your Scaleway endpoint
2. **Create a customer gateway**, your remote endpoint
3. **Create a routing policy**, to control traffic flow
4. **Create a VPN connection**, to link all elements and enable the encrypted VPN tunnel

This document explains how to create a **VPN gateway** with the Scaleway console, as the first step to creating a working Site-to-Site VPN.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to TODO

1. Click **Site-to-Site VPN** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu.

2. Click the **VPN gateways** tab, then **Create VPN gateway**. The creation wizard displays.

3. **Choose a region** in which to create your VPN gateway. The resource will be created in this geographical location. VPN gateways must be in the same region as the resources (customer gateways, connections etc.) you want to use them with.

4. **Choose a zone** (optional) if you want to pinpoint exactly where in the region your gateway should be created. 

5. **Choose a gateway type**, based on bandwidth and how many [connections](TODO) the gateway should be able to support.

6.
