You may want to delete a Private Network or a VPC if you are reorganizing your infrastructure, cleaning up after tests, or if you want to delete a Scaleway [Project](/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project) or account.

This page helps you solve potential errors that prevent successful deletion.

## VPC vs Private Network

Understanding this difference is important for successful deletion.

- The deletion of a **V**irtual **P**rivate **C**loud (VPC) is prevented if it still contains Private Networks.
- The deletion of a Private Network is prevented if it still has attached resources or reserved IPAM IPs.

Resources (Instances, Managed Databases, Elastic Metal servers, etc.) are attached to **Private Networks**, also known as subnets. 

Private Networks are created inside a single VPC. One VPC can contain many Private Networks.

### VPC deletion problems

You may be attempting to delete your VPC via the [Scaleway console](/vpc/how-to/delete-vpc/), [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/vpc/#path-vpcs-delete-a-vpc) or other developer tool, and see one of the following error messages:

- `resource_still_in_use`
- `Detach resources from this VPC in order to delete it`
- `VPC must be empty to be deleted`
- `precondition failed: resource is still in use`

### VPC deletion solutions

The VPC must contain no Private Networks before you can delete it.

**Ensure you have deleted all the Private Networks inside the VPC**. You can see how many Private Networks are in your [VPC listing](https://console.scaleway.com/vpc/vpc) in the Scaleway console.

In order to successfully delete a Private Network, you must ensure no resources are attached to it, and there are no private IPs reserved within the network. See the [information below](#i-cant-delete-my-private-network) for full details.

**Ensure you are not trying to delete a default VPC**. Each Scaleway Project has three auto-created default VPCs, one for each region. These VPCs cannot be deleted. They are free of charge. The existence of default VPCs does not block the deletion of a Scaleway account or Project, as long as the default VPCs do not contain Private Networks with associated/attached resources.

    You can identify default VPCs by the **Default** badge in the VPC listing, even if you have changed the name of the VPC itself.

### PN deletion problems

You may be attempting to delete a Private Network VPC via the [Scaleway console](/vpc/how-to/delete-private-network/), [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/vpc/#path-private-networks-delete-a-private-network) or other developer tool, and see one of the following error messages:

- `resource_still_in_use`
- `Detach resources from this Private to delete it`
- `Private Network must be empty to be deleted`
- `precondition failed: resource_still_in_use`

### PN deletion solutions

The Private Network must have no attached or associated resources before you can delete it.

**Ensure you have detached all resources from the Private Network**. In the Scaleway console, you can see how many resources are attached to each Private Network in each VPC's **Private Networks** tab.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-pn-resources.webp" alt="A screenshot of the Scaleway console highlights the 'Resources' indicator next to each Private Network, in the Private Networks listing" />

    If there are still attached resources, you must [detach them](/vpc/how-to/attach-resources-to-pn/#how-to-detach-a-resource-from-a-private-network) before proceeding.

**Ensure there are no reserved IPs in IPAM for the Private Network**. If the resource count displays as zero, but you still cannot delete your Private Network, this may be the problem.

    - In the [IPAM section](https://console.scaleway.com/ipam/) of the Scaleway console, use the filters to select the region and VPC of your Private Network. If there are any private IPs reserved for the Private Network, release them.
