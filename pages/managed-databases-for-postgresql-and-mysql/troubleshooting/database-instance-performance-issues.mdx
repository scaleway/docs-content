## Problem

My Database Instance is not performing as expected.

## Possible causes

- High data loads
- High incoming traffic from specific apps or websites
- Huge or sub-optimized SQL queries

## Solution

You can carry out the following actions:

1. [Monitor usage metrics on Cockpit](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/monitor-databases-cockpit) to:

    - Check if the usage is nominal. The Database Instance can be impacted by high data loads or unexpected high traffic from an app or website, for example. You can [upgrade your Instance](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/upgrade-a-database) if necessary.
    - Check if there are slow queries in the Database Instance log. Huge or sub-optimized queries can slow down the instance significantly, or even fill up all the memory and trigger OOM kills.

2. Try connecting to the Database Instance in a [Private Network](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/connect-database-private-network). Public endpoint traffic for Managed Databases for MySQL and PostgreSQL goes through a load balancer, which adds significant latency. Using a Private Network also ensures better security, which makes it the recommended way to connect to a Managed Database.

3. Upgrade your storage volume solution. New Block Storage volumes provide improved performance compared to the Block Storage Legacy, for example.
