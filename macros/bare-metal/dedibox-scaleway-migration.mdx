  Only users who have linked their Dedibox account to the Scaleway console before **October 28, 2025** can manage their resources from both consoles. If you did not complete this process, you can use the **[Dedibox console](https://console.online.net)** to place orders, manage your Dedibox servers, and access the [related documentation](/dedibox/quickstart/).
