    </Message>

3. Click in the search bar and enter the keyword you are looking for. The keyword can be the name or the ID of a resource, or the name of a Scaleway product.

    <Message type="note">
    As this is an early version (v2) of the search bar, results are limited. This version of the search bar may not yet include all resources and a "no result" message may appear despite the existence of the resource.
