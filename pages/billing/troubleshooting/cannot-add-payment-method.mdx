## I can't find my credit card validation code

### Cause
When adding a new credit card to your Scaleway account, a €1 authorization charge is made to verify the card's validity. This transaction includes a 4-digit validation code which appears on your bank statement. It typically appears on your bank statement within 24 hours. 

### Solution
- **Wait for the code to appear**: the validation code typically appears on your bank statement within 24 hours. If you do not see it immediately, please wait for this period.
- **Check your bank statement**: review your bank account statement for the €1 authorization charge from Scaleway. The 4-digit validation code should be included in the transaction details.
- **Contact Scaleway support**: if you still need help, please contact Scaleway's support team to validate your credit card.

## I tried to add a credit card, but I got a "card already registered" message

### Cause
A credit card can only be registered once across all Scaleway Organizations. This means that if your card is already linked to another Scaleway account, you will not be able to add it again.

### Solution
- Ensure that the credit card is not already registered to another Scaleway account. If you have multiple accounts, verify if the card is linked to one of them.
- If the card is already in use, consider adding a different credit card to your account.
