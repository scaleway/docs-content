Billing alerts allow you to oversee your expenses efficiently. This feature allows you to create alerts that notify you when predefined budget thresholds are met. Your alerts can be seamlessly delivered through SMS, email, or API webhooks.

Your budget, denominated in euros, represents the limit for your expenses. Simultaneously, the threshold corresponds to a predetermined percentage of this budget. You have the autonomy to define both the budget and the threshold within the Scaleway console.

**For example:**

  - If you have defined a budget of €1,000, you may configure an email notification to be sent once you have consumed 50% of this limit. In this case, once your consumption reaches €500, you will receive an email informing you that the limit threshold has been reached.

    Billing alerts only provide a rough estimate of what may be charged to your monthly invoice. Additional costs related to your usage before the alert is triggered may still appear on your invoice after the alert is generated. Only your monthly invoice is considered legally valid.

### Webhook API Call

When you configure a Webhook, an `HTTP` request is made to the configured URL. It transmits the following information as an `HTTP POST` request to the specified URL:

```
Header: "Content-Type": "application/json"
POST /my/configured/webhook
{
    "invoice_start_date": <INVOICE_START_DATE>,
    "threshold": <THRESHOLD_VALUE_IN_PERCENT>
}
```
