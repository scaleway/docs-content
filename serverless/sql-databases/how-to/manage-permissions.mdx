Permissions define the actions a user or an application can perform on a database. They are managed using Scaleway's [Identity and Access Management](/identity-and-access-management/iam/quickstart/) interface.

<Macro id="requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
</Message>

1. Click **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** from the top-right of your [**Organization Dashboard**](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) in the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) displays.

2. Click the **Policies** tab. A list of the Organization's existing policies displays.

3. Click **Create a policy**. The policy creation wizard displays.

4. Complete the steps of the first page of the creation wizard:

  - Enter a **name** for the policy.

  - Enter a **description** (optional).

  - Select a **principal**, who will be the target of your policy. The [principal](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#principal) should be the user, application, or group who you want to give access to your database.

  <Message type="important">
    - You can choose to create a policy without a principal for now, and attach the principal later.
    - The policy will have no effect until a principal is attached.
    - A policy can only be attached to one principal at a time.
  </Message>

5. Click **Add rules**. The second screen of the policy creation wizard.

6. Select **Access to resources**, then, select the [Project](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#project) in which you want the permissions to apply.

7. Click **Validate** to continue.

8. Select **Serverless** in the left-hand **Products** list, then, tick the permissions set you want to add to the policy:

  - **ServerlessSQLDatabaseFullAccess** allows the user to create and delete databases, edit their configuration, and to use the following commands:

    - `SELECT`
    - `UPDATE`
    - `INSERT`
    - `DELETE`
    - `CREATE/ALTER/DROP TABLE`
    - `CREATE/DROP INDEX`

  - **ServerlessSQLDatabaseReadWrite** allows the user to use the following commands: 
  
    - `SELECT`
    - `UPDATE`
    - `INSERT`
    - `DELETE`
    - `CREATE/ALTER/DROP TABLE`
    - `CREATE/DROP INDEX`

  - **ServerlessSQLDatabaseReadOnly** allows the user to use the following commands:

    - `SELECT`

9. Click **Validate**. The **scope** and the **permission sets** of your policy display.


10. Click **Create policy** to finish.
