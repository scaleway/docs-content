## How am I billed for my compute Instances?

Compute Instances are billed on a pay-as-you-go basis. The price of your Instance is made up of three parts:

* the price of the Instance itself
* the price of the storage (local or block). You can adjust storage quantity when you create the Instance
* the price of the flexible IP - you can change or delete associated flexible IP afterward

### Instance Pricing as of July 1st 2022

<Message type="important">
  Prices indicated below do not include storage or IP. Bear in mind that the following prices will be effective starting July 1st 2022.

### IP Pricing

Each flexible IPv4 for an Instance costs 0,002€/hour excl. VAT.

## Which Linux distributions are available?

We provide a wide range of different [Linux distributions](https://www.scaleway.com/en/imagehub/) and InstantApps for Instances.

You are free to bootstrap your own distribution. 

## How can I create an image?

You must [create at least one snapshot](/compute/instances/how-to/create-a-snapshot/) before you can create an image.

See the documentation on [creating an image from scratch](/compute/instances/how-to/create-image-from-snapshot/).


## What is the ImageHub?

Scaleway's ImageHub is a catalog of system images that allow you to deploy, manage and scale your favorite applications in seconds, from image templates.

## Which options are available to power off my Instance?

When you request to power off your Instance, four options are available:
- Hard Reboot
- Power off
- Terminate
- Standby

When you select the **Hard Reboot** option, your instance performs an electrical reboot. Your data remains on the local storage. Whenever possible, you should reboot your instance from the OS to avoid data corruption.

When you select the **Power off** option, all data on the local volume of your instance is transferred to a volume store, and your physical node is released back to the pool of available machines. Depending on the amount of data to be archived, the process can take time.

When you select the **Terminate** option, your instance and volumes are deleted. You will not be able to recover them. The flexible IP attached to your instance will not be deleted.

When you select the **Standby** option, your instance is stopped, but all your data remains on the local storage. Your instance is still allocated to your account, and you can restart it anytime, without delay.

<Message type="important">
  With the Standby option, you are still charged the same amount as if the instance is running.

## Can I reach my Instance using a DNS hostname instead of its IP address?

Yes, each Instance has two DNS hostnames associated with it: 

* A public DNS hostname: `<instance-uuid>.pub.instances.scw.cloud` 
* A private DNS hostname: `<instance-uuid>.priv.instances.scw.cloud`

Both are being updated automatically when the Instance moves to another hypervisor (and thus its IPv6, and the private IPv4, changes). You can either use these hostnames directly or configure a [CNAME record](/dedibox-network/dns/concepts/#resource-records) linking to it. 

## Why do I have to specify the CPU architecture when I create an image from a volume?

ARM and x86-based Instances (Development Instances and General Purpose Instances) use a different instruction set and this requires to specify the architecture of the platform when creating an image from a volume.

An ARM CPU is using a Reduced Instruction Set Computing ([RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer)) architecture while an x86 CPU is using a Complex Instruction Set Computing ([CISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer)) architecture.
Hence, ARM architecture uses a simplified instruction set which results in power efficiency, making it ideal for mobile devices. Therefore ARM64 Instances are ideal to develop and test mobile applications.

## What is a Marketplace image?

A Marketplace is an online store that offers applications and services either built on or integrated with Scaleway's offerings.

Scaleway marketplace image provides customers with information related to Instance images, through variants named “local-images”. This information can include the Instance zone and identification, along with constraints regarding the applicable Instance types. When you want to create an Instance using an image in the [Instance API](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/instance/api/), you need to specify the local-image UUID matching the zone and Instance type constraints you fetch from the marketplace API. 

Use the marketplace API to determine the UUID of the image you want to use with this command:

  ```
  scw marketplace image get label=image_name
  ```

Replace the `image_name` with the name of your image or distribution, e.g.: `ubuntu_focal` or `debian_stretch`.

## Can I boot my Instance from a Block Storage volume?

Yes. When creating an Instance, you can select Block Storage as a system volume type. This allows you to reboot Instances from the block volume on which your OS is stored. 

You can also add a Block volume after you have created your Instance and [choose it as the boot volume](/compute/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes/#how-to-change-the-boot-volume).

## What is the minimum volume size my Instance can have?

Your **system volume** must be at least 10GB (125GB for a GPU OS).

When [creating an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance), you must select a [local](/compute/instances/concepts/#local-volumes) or [block](/compute/instances/concepts/#block-volumes) to be the system volume. Your **system volume** is the volume on which your Instance will boot, so it is necessary you have a minimum size available to store the OS.
