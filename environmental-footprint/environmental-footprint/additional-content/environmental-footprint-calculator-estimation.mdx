When you [order an Elastic Metal server](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/create-server/), you can see the estimated impact of your Elastic Metal server of choice before you order. In this page we explain how the estimation is measured.

<Message type="note">
  The estimation described on this page is based on the calculation methodology detailed in the [Environmental Footprint calculation breakdown](/environmental-footprint/environmental-footprint/additional-content/environmental-footprint-calculator) documentation page.

## Availability Zone footprint estimation

When you select the Availability Zone of your Elastic Metal, you can see the indication of quantity of CO2e emitted per kW consumed per zone.

<Message type="tip">
  When creating an Elastic Metal server, you can click the **Low CO2 only** toggle to show only the regions that have low CO2 emission rates.

This data is determined by the [PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness)](/environmental-footprint/environmental-footprint/concepts/#pue-power-usage-effectiveness) of the datacenter and the [energy mix](#energy-mix) of the country in which the datacenter is located.

<Message type="note">
  We use [Ember's](https://ember-climate.org/) Electricity Data Explorer to determine the impact linked to the energy mix. You can also refer to [Electricity Maps' Environmental Impact by Zone map](https://app.electricitymaps.com/map) for a visual representation of the energy mix of each region, including France, Poland, and the Netherlands.

## Elastic Metal offers footprint estimation

For Elastic Metal offers, the environmental footprint estimation considers the impact of the **manufacturing** and **use** of all the elements that allow the service to work, such as network, cross-IT equipment and stock, and non-IT elements, Availability Zone  for example.

The estimation is based on tests carried out by the Hardware team at Scaleway. Each range of offers was tested using different compute configurations, to ensure coverage of a variety of possible power consumption set ups.

These different compute configurations allow us to simulate enough use cases to have an idea of the power consumption, but the actual consumption will depend on how the server is used in practice.

We estimate the measure the server's electricity consumption and then calculate its estimated impact based on the energy mix of the selected zone and the datacenter's PUE.

The estimation is represented in kgCO₂e per hour or per month, depending on the billing method chosen.
