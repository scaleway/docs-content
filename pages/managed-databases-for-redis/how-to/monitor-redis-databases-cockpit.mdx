You can view your Managed Database for Redis™ metrics and logs using [Scaleway Cockpit](/cockpit/quickstart/). Managed Databases are fully integrated into Cockpit.

Monitoring is available for:

- Primary Database Instance nodes
- Secondary nodes (if in High Availability or in Cluster mode)

This page explains how to get started with Scaleway Cockpit for viewing your Managed Database for Redis™' metrics and logs.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [Redis™ Database Instance](/managed-databases-for-redis/quickstart/)

## How to activate your Cockpit

Scaleway Cockpit is activated by default if you have created any [Scaleway resources integrated with Cockpit](/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-limitations/#product-integration-into-cockpit).

## How to access the Grafana dashboard

To view your Managed Database's metrics and logs, use the Grafana dashboard which is accessible from the Scaleway console:
  - First, you must create a user and their associated credentials (a username and password) for Grafana
  - Then, you can use these credentials to access the Grafana dashboard for all your Scaleway products, via the Scaleway console.

1. Create a Grafana user and retrieve their username and password by [following this procedure](/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/).

2. From the Scaleway console [Cockpit overview page](https://console.scaleway.com/cockpit/overview), click **Open dashboards** in the top right corner.

3. Enter your Grafana username and password to log in.

    You are directed to the Scaleway Cockpit dashboards homepage.

## How to view and understand your Managed Database metrics

1. Click **Open dashboards** on the top right from the Scaleway Cockpit dashboards homepage.
2. Click **Dashboards** in the left menu, then **Redis Overview** in the list of products.

    You are directed to the RDB Overview dashboard.

Metrics are refreshed every minute, and report on the following data:

- CPU usage
- Node usage
- Database memory usage
- Network I/O
- Connected/Blocked clients
- Hits/Misses per second
- Expiring/Not-expiring keys
- Expired/Evicted keys

### Choosing metric parameters

At the top of the dashboard, you can configure the following parameters, that control which metrics are displayed:

- Resource name - Select a specific Database Instance to monitor.
- Node - Choose a specific node (main or replica). In a High Availability (HA) cluster, both nodes might switch from main to replica and vice versa. You might see two versions of the same node, as main and as replica. If you select main for a specific node, you will only see the node's activity when it was the main, and vice-versa. In Cluster mode, all nodes are considered primary and each have a data subset.
- Timeframe - Get metrics from the last five minutes up to 31 days (free plan) and 365 days (premium plan).

### Viewing logs

The log section is displayed below the metrics section.

Click **Logs** to collapse the tab and view your logs.

You can [configure Redis™ advanced settings](/managed-databases-for-redis/how-to/configure-advanced-settings-redis) to define parameters for slow logs.

| Parameter | Description |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| `slowlog-log-slower-than` | Specifies how many microseconds (1 second = 1,000,000 microseconds) the execution time of a command must exceed to be recorded in the slow query log. |
| `slowlog-max-len` | Specifies the maximum number of slow query logs that the server retains. The server retains multiple slow query logs on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis. When the number of slow query logs stored by the server equals the slowlog-max-len value, the server will delete the oldest slow query log before adding a new one. |


## How to activate pre-configured alerts

You can activate Scaleway pre-configured alerts for your Managed Databases with Scaleway Cockpit.

<Message type="note">
  Refer to the [How to activate pre-configured alerts](/cockpit/how-to/activate-managed-alerts/) to learn how to do so.
</Message>

By default, two pre-configured alerts are available for Managed Databases:

- `HighCpuUsage` - Alerts if CPU usage has been higher than 80% for 10 consecutive minutes
- `HighMemoryUsage` - RAM usage has been higher than 80% for 10 consecutive minutes

You can also configure [your own alerts](/cockpit/how-to/configure-alerts-for-scw-resources/) and set values for each of the parameters below to define when you want to be alerted:


| Alert | Description |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| `rkv_cluster_node_cpu_seconds_total` | Total amount of CPU time consumed by the Database Instance, measured in seconds |
| `rkv_cluster_node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes` | Amount of memory available |
| `rkv_cluster_node_memory_MemTotal_bytes` | Total installed physical memory (RAM) |
| `rkv_cluster_redis_blocked_clients`  | Total blocked connections on Redis™ |
| `rkv_cluster_redis_config_maxclients` | Maximum number of connections configured |
| `rkv_cluster_redis_connected_clients` | Total active connections on Redis™ |
| `rkv_cluster_redis_db_keys` | Total number of keys stored  |
| `rkv_cluster_redis_db_keys_expiring` | Total number of keys that have an expiration date |
| `rkv_cluster_redis_evicted_keys_total` | Total number of keys that were evicted because of memory pressure |
| `rkv_cluster_redis_expired_keys_total` | Total number of keys that have expired |
| `rkv_cluster_redis_keyspace_hits_total` | Total number of requests that found a match in the database |
| `rkv_cluster_redis_keyspace_misses_total` | Total number of request that did not find a match in the database |
| `rkv_cluster_redis_memory_max_bytes` | Amount of memory available for Redis™ |
| `rkv_cluster_redis_memory_used_bytes` | Amount of memory used by Redis™ |
| `rkv_cluster_redis_net_input_bytes_total` | Total incoming traffic received by Redis™ from clients, measured in bytes |
| `rkv_cluster_redis_net_output_bytes_total` | Total outgoing traffic sent by Redis™, measured in bytes |
