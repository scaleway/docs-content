## Introduction

So you know how to **create variables** in Python (`my_variable = 3`), as well as how to **create lists** (`my_list = [3, 5, 9, 6]`) and **dictionaries** (`my_dict = {"Sara": 3 "Aneesa": 5, "Emmanuel": 9, "Tom": 6}`) to store multiple items in a single variable? Then you're ready to learn about **loops**.

A **loop** is a piece of code that tells Python to repeat a specified set of actions multiple times. Loops are a fundamental part of most programming languages, and let you achieve a whole lot with just a few lines of code. Often, they **iterate** over collections of data (such as data held in dictionaries or lists) and carry out all sorts of operations on those collections.

Why are loops useful? Let's look at a quick example:

Imagine you have a list of numbers, and you want to find every number higher than 10. Without a loop, the code is very long and repetitive:

```python
my_list = [3, 10.1, 62, 9]
  
if my_list[0] > 10:
  print(my_list[0])
  
if my_list[1] > 10:
  print(my_list[1])
  
if my_list[2] > 10:
  print(my_list[2])
  
if my_list[3] > 10:
  print(my_list[3])
  
## Output:
10.1
62
```

With a for loop, we can do it in just three lines of code:

```python
for number in my_list:
  if number > 10:
    print(number)
  
## Output:
10.1
62
```

Let's dive into the world of for loops in python, and learn how to code them and what we can do with them.

<Message type="note">
There are two types of loop in Python: 
- **while**-loops repeat while a certain condition is true and exit once the condition is false.
- **for**-loops iterate over a sequence or collection of data and exit when they reach the end of the sequence/collection. 
This tutorial concerns only **for** loops.

## For-loop syntax and basic examples

The syntax for a for loop is as follows:

```
for element in iterable-object:
  statement(s)
```

Here are some basic examples of loops iterating over different types of objects:

      <TabsTab label="List">
        ```python
        my_list = ["red", "blue", "yellow"]
          
        for color in my_list:
          print(color)
          
        ## output:
        red
        blue
        yellow
        ```
      </TabsTab>

      <TabsTab label="String">
        ```python
        word = "hello"
          
        for letter in word:
          print(letter)
          
        ## output:
        h
        e
        l
        l 
        o
        ```

      <TabsTab label="Dictionary">
        ```python
        product_dict = {"bread": 1.5, "jam": 2.75, "butter": 0.99}
      
        for product in product_dict:
          print(product)
          
        ### output:
        bread
        jam
        butter

        for product in product_dict:
          print(product_dict.get(product))
          
        ### output:
        1.5
        2.75
        0.99
        ```
      </TabsTab>
      <TabsTab label="Range">
        ```python
        for x in range (1, 4):
          print(x)

- **for**: this keyword is required to start a loop
- **element**: after the `for` keyword, we can use any variable name we want! This variable will simply access each item of the sequence on each iteration. In the examples above you can see that we've called it variously `element`, `color`, `letter`, `product`, and `x`. Anything works, but generally you should try to give this variable a meaningful name: it will make your code easier to read for yourself and anyone else who looks at it.
- **in**: this keyword is required to introduce the object you want to iterate over in the loop
- **iterable-object**: after the `in` keyword, state the object you want to iterate over. This can be any iterable object, including lists, strings, dictionaries, ranges, tuples and sets. 
- The for statement must end with a **colon**, followed by a **line return** and **indentation**.
- **statement(s)**: One or more actions to be carried out on every iteration of the loop. In the examples above we simply use a print statement, but anything is possible.

### For-loops: basic exercises

<Message type="tip">
When working with loops, you will probably find it more practical to use a [text editor and the terminal](/tutorials/get-started-python/#6:-from-the-shell-to-a-script) or [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/)/a , rather than the [Python Interactive Shell](/tutorials/get-started-python/#2:-getting-ready-to-code:-opening-the-python-interactive-shell).
</Message>

1. Run the following code to get started with your first loop, making sure to include all the necessary syntax such as the colon and indentation:

  ```
  my_list = ["red", "blue", "yellow"]
          
  for color in my_list:
     print(color)
  ```

2. Run the following loop, to see how you can define the object to loop through directly in the loop statement itself:

  ```
  for country in ["France", "Japan", "USA"]:
    print(country)
  ```

3. Using the example of a loop with a range [above](#for-loop-syntax-and-basic-examples), create a loop that prints out the numbers 1 to 6. 

    Answer [below](TODO).

4. Using the example of looping over a string [above](#for-loop-syntax-and-basic-examples), create a loop that prints out the letters A B C D E.

    Answer [below](TODO).

5. Using the example of looping over a dictionary [above](#for-loop-syntax-and-basic-examples), create a dictionary `{"France": "Paris", "Japan": "Tokyo", "USA": "Washington DC"}`, then:
  - Create a loop that prints out the names of the countries
  - Create a loop that prints out the names of the capital cities

  Answer [below](TODO).

## For loops with an if/else statement

We can use an if/else statement inside the loop to deal with different possibilities:

```python
for number in [1, 10, 9, 4]:
  if number > 5:
    print(number, " is greater than 5")
  else:
    print(number, " is not greater than 5")
  
## Output:
1 is not greater than 5
10 is greater than 5
9 is greater than 5
4 is not greater than 5
```

<Message type="tip">

Note that in the example above, we can print a variable and some text in the same string by separating them with commas and putting the text in quotation marks:

```
print(variable_name, " text you want here", another_variable_name, " more text here")
```

### For loops with if/else: exercises

1. Create a loop that iterates over the list `[1, 10, 9, 4]` and checks whether each number is greater than 3. The output should look like this:

    ```
    1 is not greater than 3
    10 is greater than 3
    9 is greater than 3
    4 is greater than 3
    ```

    Answer [below](TODO).

3. Create a loop that iterates over the list `["France", "Japan", "the USA"] and searches for "the USA" in the list. The output should look like this:

    ```
    This country is not the USA
    This country is not the USA
    This country is the USA
    ```

    Answer [below](TODO).

3. Create a loop that iterates over the list [-1, 2, 3, 0, -4] and checks whether each number is positive or negative. The output should look like this:

    ```
    -1 is a negative number
    2 is a positive number
    3 is a positive number
    0 is neither positive nor negative
    -4 is a negative number
    ```

    Answer [below](TODO).

4. Create code that includes a loop that iterates over the list [-1, -3, -5, -7, 0] to search for positive numbers. If it finds a positive number it prints "<number> is positive number", but as there aren't any the output should look like this:

    ```
    There are no positive numbers in the list
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
    You may need multiple if statements. Think carefully about where to put them.

## For loops with a range() function

As we saw in an earlier example we can use loops with Python's built-in `range()` function to state exactly how many times we want the loop to iterate.

This function can be used in a number of ways:

With just one parameter, the range starts at a default of 0 and finishes at (not including) the specified number:

```python
for x in range(3):
  print(x)
  
## Output:
0
1
2
```

With two parameters, we set the start and finish numbers of the range:

```python
for x in range(2, 6):
  print(x)
  
## Output:
2
3
4
5
```

With three parameters, we set the start and finish numbers of the range, and the **step** value (the interval between each iteration):

```python
for x in range(2, 10, 2):
  print(x)
  
## Output:
2
4
6
8
```

### For loops with ranges: exercises

1. Create a loop that iterates over a range and produces the following output:

    ```
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9
    ```

2. Create a loop that iterates over a range and produces the following output:

    ```
    0
    25
    50
    75
    ```

3. Create code that includes a loop that iterates over a range, and produces the following output:

    ```
    Counting down...
    5
    4
    3
    2
    1
    Go!
    ```

### Nested for-loops

We can use a loop inside another loop: this is called a **nested loop**. This is useful if, for example, you want to loop through a list of lists:

```python

groups = [["Kendall", "Shiv", "Roman"], ["Logan", "Ewan", "Gerri"], ["Tom", "Greg"]]
  
# this first loop iterates through each group:
for group in groups:
    # this second loop iterates through the people in each group:
        for person in group:
            ## we can access both the 'group' and 'person' variables here!
            print(person, "is in the group", group)
  
## Output:
Kendall is in the group ['Kendall', 'Shiv', 'Roman']
Shiv is in the group ['Kendall', 'Shiv', 'Roman']
Roman is in the group ['Kendall', 'Shiv', 'Roman']
Logan is in the group ['Logan', 'Ewan', 'Gerri']
Ewan is in the group ['Logan', 'Ewan', 'Gerri']
Gerri is in the group ['Logan', 'Ewan', 'Gerri']
Tom is in the group ['Tom', 'Greg']
Greg is in the group ['Tom', 'Greg']
```

### Nested for-loops: exercises

1. Create code with a nested loop based on the list of lists `[["apple", "orange"], ["carrot", "cabbage"], ["chicken", "beef"]]` and produces the following output:

    ```
    apple
    orange
    carrot
    cabbage
    chicken
    beef
    ```

2. Create code with a nested loop based on the list of lists `[["go", "went", "gone"], ["see", "saw", "seen"], ["take", "took", "taken"]]` that produces the following output:

    ```
    The conjugations of go are:
    go
    went
    gone
    The conjugations of see are:
    see
    saw
    seen
    The conjugations of take are:
    take
    took
    taken
    ```

3. Create code with a nested loop that searches the list of lists `[["50", "48", "-40"], ["57", "99", "80"], ["49, 40, 45"]]` and prints out all the numbers greater than or equal to 50. The output should look like this:

    ```
    50
    57
    99
    80
    ```
