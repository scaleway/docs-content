Since January 8th 2025, the permission set ResellerCustomerBillingManager cannot be used in policies. This permission set was only available for clients that consume Scaleway Services through a reseller.

For Organizations that used this permission set, the permission set was renamed from ResellerCustomerBillingManager to BillingManager. Scripts that used the former name of the permission set, such as Terraform scripts, should be updated and use the new BillingManager name.
