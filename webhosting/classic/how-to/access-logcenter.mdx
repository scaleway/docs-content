The logcenter allows you to visualize real-time error logs of your hosting. That way, you can quickly troubleshoot potential issues linked to your code.

## How to access the logcenter

1. [Access the logcenter](https://logcenter.online.net/).
2. Enter your domain name as login and the password set in the previous step. Then click **Connexion**. The logs of your webhosting displays in real-time.

## How to download the log files

We provide full access to your website's logs (access.log). This allows interested parties to have access to the raw data regarding visits to your website.

You can find the connection details on the statistics overview page in your console.

The log files can be downloaded via FTP access. Enter the required connection details to download them using an FTP client: 

FTP host: `stats.online.net`
User: `webmaster@domain.tld`
Password: The statistics password | see above

Remember to replace `domain.tld` with your own domain (for example: `mydomain.com`).

<Message type="tip">
  Keep in mind that even if the username is the same, the log access account is different from the main FTP account. The password is therefore different too.
