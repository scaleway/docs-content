Volumes are the storage space of your Instances. Two types of volumes exist:

* **[Local volumes](/local-storage/)**: The local volume of an Instance is an all-SSD-based storage solution, using a RAID array for redundancy and performance, hosted on the local hypervisor. On Scaleway Instances, the size of the local volume is fixed and depends on the Instance type. Some Instance types do not use local volumes and [boot directly on block volumes](/instances/concepts/#boot-on-block).

* **[Block volumes](/block-storage/)**: Block volumes provide network-attached storage you can plug in and out of Instances like a virtual hard drive. Block volumes behave like regular disks and can be used to increase the storage of an Instance.
