[Multifactor Authentication (MFA)](/account/concepts/#multifactor-authentication-mfa) adds an extra layer of security to your Organization. Enforcing MFA will make it mandatory for all users in the Organization.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to enforce MFA

1. Click the **Security** tab from the [Organization Dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/organization).
3. Scroll to the **Organization Multifactor Authentication (MFA)** section.
4. Click **Enforce MFA**.
5. Type **ENFORCE** in the box.
    <Message type="important">
    Keep in mind that:
    - MFA will become mandatory for all users in the Organization.<br /><br />
    - If MFA is enforced in your Organization, all new [Members](/iam/concepts/#member) you create will have to enable MFA within the [grace period](/iam/concepts/#grace-period) you set. If they fail to do so before the grace period is over, their account will be locked. The same applies for existing members who do not yet have MFA enabled. Once you enforce MFA, they also have to comply with this [security requirement](/iam/how-to/enforce-security-requirements-members) within the grace period.

6. Click **Enforce MFA**.
    - If all users in your Organization already have enabled MFA, a confirmation message appears on the top right corner of the screen.
