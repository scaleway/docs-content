When you [order an Elastic Metal server](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/create-server/), you can see the estimated impact of your Elastic Metal server of choice before you order. In this page we explain how the estimation is measured.

<Message type="note">
  The estimation described on this page is based on the calculation methodology detailed in the [Environmental Footprint calculation breakdown](/environmental-footprint/environmental-footprint/additional-content/environmental-footprint-calculator) documentation page.

## Availability Zone footprint estimation

When you select your Elastic Metal server's Availability Zone, you can see the quantity of CO2e emitted per kW consumed per zone.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-env-impact-estimation-az.webp" alt="screenshot of the Scaleway console showing the different availability zones in which you can create an Elastic Metal server. For each AZ, three green leaves indicate the level of environmental impact - the system is explained below." />

This data is determined by the [Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)](/environmental-footprint/environmental-footprint/concepts/#pue-power-usage-effectiveness) of the datacenter and the [energy mix](/environmental-footprint/environmental-footprint/concepts/#energy-mix) of the country in which the datacenter is located.

<Message type="note">
  We use [Ember's](https://ember-climate.org/) Electricity Data Explorer to determine the impact linked to the energy mix. The impact related to the energy mix is ​​very different from one country to another and will have a strong influence on the final impact of an offer. You can compare the impact of electricity in different countries on [Electricity Maps' Environmental Impact](https://app.electricitymaps.com/map)

The estimation is represented by three green leaf icons:

  - When the three leafs are dark green, this means that the AZ has the lowest quantity of CO2e emitted per kW consumed, so each kw consumed in you elastic metal will have a lower impact.
  - When two leafs are dark green, this means this that the AZ has a low quantity of CO2e emitted per kW consumed
  - When only one leaf is dark green, the AZ has bigger quantity of CO2e emitted per kW consumed

  When you hover your cursor over the leaves or when you select the AZ, you can see the detail of the environmental footprint estimation in kgCO₂e.

<Message type="important">
  The AZ footprint estimation is a straightforward calculation of CO₂ emissions per kW of electricity consumed, based on the energy mix and the data center’s Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) specific to that AZ. For example, in an AZ like PAR-2, each kW consumed may have an impact of 0.065 kgCO₂e. <br /><br />

  Meanwhile, the offer footprint estimation is a more complex calculation that combines the AZ-specific data with additional factors relevant to the specific offer. This calculation considers not just energy consumption but also other elements, which are outlined in the [Environmental Footprint calculation breakdown](/environmental-footprint/environmental-footprint/additional-content/environmental-footprint-calculator) documentation page, to reflect a comprehensive impact specific to the offer rather than just adding up kW-based impacts.

## Elastic Metal offers footprint estimation

For Elastic Metal offers, the environmental footprint estimation considers the impact of the **manufacturing** and **use** of all the elements that allow the service to work, such as network, cross-IT equipment and stock, and non-IT elements, for example. The AZ you chose in the previous step will impact the **use** part by multiplying each kw consumed by each of these elements by the value indicated.

For usage impact, We base ourselves on an estimate of electricity consumption. This estimation is based on tests carried out by the Hardware team at Scaleway. Each range of offers was tested using different compute configurations to ensure coverage of a variety of possible power consumption setups.

These different compute configurations allow us to simulate enough use cases to have an idea of the power consumption, but the actual consumption will depend on how the server is used in practice.

We estimate the measure the server's electricity consumption and then calculate its estimated impact based on the energy mix of the selected zone and the datacenter's PUE.

The estimation is represented by three green leaf icons:

For each offer, three green leaves indicate the level of environmental impact - the system is explained below." />

  - When the three leafs are dark green, this means that the offer has the lowest environmental impact
  - When two leafs are dark green, this means this that the offer has a low environmental impact
  - When only one leaf is dark green, the offer has bigger environmental impact

  When you hover your cursor over the leaves or when you select an offer, you can see the detail of the environmental footprint estimation in kgCO₂e per hour or per month, depending on the billing method chosen.

A summary of the total environmental footprint estimation for the selected offer is shown before the order summary. We also add an indication to help you imagine what this impact is, to better understand.
