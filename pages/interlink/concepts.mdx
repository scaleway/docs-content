## Attached VPC

Each InterLink can be attached to one Scaleway VPC. The InterLink and the VPC must be in the same [region](#region). You can detach the InterLink from the VPC at any time, and attach it to a different VPC in the same region, if you wish. When an InterLink is not attached to any VPC, no traffic can flow.

## Bandwidth

Every InterLink has a defined bandwidth, representing the maximum data transfer rate possible over the link. Measured in megabits per second (Mbps) or gigabits per second (Gbps), it shows how much data can be transmitted over InterLink per second.

## Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)

**B**order **G**ateway **P**rotocol (BGP) is a standardized gateway protocol that allows autonomous systems to exchange routing information. InterLink uses BGP to facilitate [route propagation](#route-propagation), so that the Scaleway VPC and the external infrastructure's router can learn each other's routes.

## Connection type

The type of physical connection for an InterLink. InterLink is available in both **hosted** and **self-hosted** connection types:

- **Hosted InterLink**:  The customer provisions an InterLink via a [partner](#partner), who facilitates the physical connection between the external infrastructure and the Scaleway VPC. The physical connection may be shared between several clients: each gets a specified amount when creating their InterLink.
- **Self-hosted InterLink**: The customer provisions an InterLink using their own dedicated physical connection. They get the entire bandwidth of the connection, which can be used to provision several InterLinks for themselves.

[Find out more about connection types](/interlink/reference-content/overview/#types-of-interlink).

## Dedicated physical connection

To create a self-hosted InterLink, you must first provision a dedicated physical connection between your router and Scaleway's router. You get sole use of a single InterLink port on Scaleway's router, with the entire bandwidth of that port. This connection and its bandwidth can then be used to create several InterLinks. To provision a dedicated physical connection, [contact our sales team](https://www.scaleway.com/en/contact-sales/).

## Hosted InterLink

See [connection type](#connection-type).

## InterLink

InterLink, currently in Public Beta, is Scaleway's product to let you create a secure, private connection between your external infrastructure, and your Scaleway VPC. This allows you to direct your traffic safely from your Scaleway infrastructure to your on-premises infrastructure, away from the public internet.

For more information on how InterLink works, see our [detailed overview](/interlink/reference-content/overview/).

## Location

A location, aka a **P**oint **o**f **P**resence (PoP), is a physical location where you can establish an InterLink between your on-premises infrastructure and the Scaleway network. For hosted InterLinks, locations are facilitated by partners.

## Pairing key

A pairing key is a unique identifier used to establish and authenticate a hosted link InterLink via a partner. It is provided by Scaleway once an InterLink order is made. You must then share this key with your selected partner to facilitate the setup of the physical link. The pairing key ensures that the correct endpoints are securely connected.

## Partner

A partner is a third party service provider that facilitates a hosted InterLink between a client's on-premises infrastructure, and their Scaleway infrastructure. Current partners include [Free Pro](https://pro.free.fr/) and [France IX](https://www.franceix.net), with more coming soon.

Partners are generally companies specialized in data transit, with their own fibers at data connection points. To establish an InterLink via a partner, generally you must be a client of that partner, e.g. with your infrastructure in their datacenter, or on your own premises using the partner as a network provider. See our information on [hosted InterLinks](/interlink/reference-content/overview/#hosted-interlinks) for more information.

## PoP

See [Location](#location)

## Region

When creating an InterLink, you must specify a [region](/vpc/concepts/#region-and-availability-zone) for the resource. The region sets the scope for the Scaleway infrastructure that can be connected via the InterLink: it must correspond to the region of the VPC to attach to the InterLink.

## Route propagation

Route propagation can be activated or deactivated at any given time on an InterLink. When activated, the Scaleway VPC and external infrastructure communicate via BGP sessions to dynamically exchange and update information about their routes. Route propagation must be activated to allow traffic to flow over the InterLink. When deactivated, all pre-learned/announced routes are removed from the VPC's route table, and traffic cannot flow. Note that even with route propagation activated, the default rule blocks all route announcements: you must attach a [routing policy](#routing-policy) to specify the route ranges to whitelist. [Learn more about routing across an InterLink](/interlink/reference-content/overview/#routing-across-an-interLink)

## Routing policy

The default rule blocks any and all routes from being propagated over InterLink. Attaching a routing policy allows you to define the ranges of routes that should be whitelisted. When creating a routing policy, you specify one or many IP ranges representing the outgoing routes to announce from the Scaleway VPC, and one or many IP ranges representing the incoming route announcements to accept from the external infrastructure. 

IPv4 and IPv6 routes must be whitelisted in separate routing policies. An InterLink must therefore have a **minimum of one** and a **maximum of two** attached routing policies, one for each IP traffic type to be routed (IPv4 and/or IPv6). When [route propagation](#route-propagation) is activated, the route ranges defined in the attached routing polic(ies) are whitelisted, and traffic can flow across the InterLink along these routes.
