Make sure that you are editing the correct Project before adding new [resources](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#resource) to it.

<Macro id="requirements" >

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [added and validated a payment method](/console/account/how-to/manage-billing-information/#how-to-add-a-payment-method)
</Message>

1. Click the **Projects** tab from the [Organization Dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/organization). A list of your Projects displays.
2. Click the name of the Project to which you want to add resources.
3. Select the resource you want to create from the side menu.
4. Refer to the corresponding documentation to create the resource.

    Once the resource is created, it is automatically included in your Project.

<Message type="tip">
  Alternatively, you can create other resources via the top-right **Create** button at the top right.
</Message>

<Message type="note">
  It is currently not possible to transfer resources from one Project to another. For Object Storage, you can [import copies of your objects to buckets in different Projects](/storage/object/api-cli/migrating-buckets/).
