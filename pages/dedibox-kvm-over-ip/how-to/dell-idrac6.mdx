This page shows you how to use [KVM](/dedibox-kvm-over-ip/concepts/#kvm-over-ip) on a Dedibox with DELL iDRAC 6.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- Installed [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation) on your machine
- Installed [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html) on your local computer
- A Dedibox server with a Dell iDRAC 6 IPMI interface

## Creating an iDRAC 6 session

1. Click **Server** > **Server List** in your Dedibox console. The list of your dedicated servers displays.
2. Click the name of the server you want to access. The server's status page displays.
3. Click **iDRAC** in the menu on the right. A pop-up displays.

    <Message type="note">
      Currently, only IPv4 addresses are accepted.
    </Message>

The connection URL and your credentials display. Click on the link to access the iDRAC interface.


## Accessing the KVM-over-IP device using Podman

You can use Docker to access the KVM-over-IP device of your Dedibox.

### Installation

- On **macOS** run the following command to install Podman:
```bash
brew install podman
```
- On **Ubuntu** run the following commands to install Podman:
```bash
# Ubuntu 20.10 and newer
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install podman
```
- On **Windows** you can install Podman using the [official installer](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/releases).

### Configuration

1. Create (once) a virtual machine:
  ```bash
  podman machine init
  ```

2. Run it with:
  ```bash
  podman machine start
  ```

3. When you have finished, run:
  ```bash
  podman container stop -a ; podman container rm -a
  ```
  to delete old sessions. You can also run this command if you won't need the virtual machine:
  ```bash
  podman machine stop
  ```

### Pull repository

Pull the [iDRAC 6 dockerized](https://hub.docker.com/r/domistyle/idrac6/) Docker repository:
```bash
podman pull domistyle/idrac6
```

### Run container

1. Run the container with the following command:
  ```bash
  podman run -d -p 5800:5800 -p 5900:5900 -e IDRAC_HOST=$ip -e IDRAC_USER=$user -e IDRAC_PASSWORD=$password domistyle/idrac6
  ```
  <Message type="note">
    - Replace `$ip`, `$user` and `$password` with your iDRAC credentials.
  </Message>

2. Access the HTML5 KVM by opening `http://localhost:5800` in a web browser.

## Alternative: Accessing the KVM-over-IP device using Java

If you do not want to use Docker to access the KVM-over-IP device of your server, you can use a Java applet to launch the virtual console.

1. Open the connection URL of your iDRAC in your web browser, then log in using the credentials displayed during access creation.
2. Click **Console/Media** the top menu.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_idrac_console.webp" alt="" />
3. Click **Launch Virtual Console**.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_idrac_launch_console.webp"  alt="" />
4. Download and execute the Java web start file. The virtual console window displays.

    <Message type="tip">
      Your Java security settings should be set to **Low** to execute the Java applet.

## Installing an operating system using the virtual console

You can use the virtual console to install an operating system on your server.
1. Connect to the virtual console as described in the previous section.
2. Download the ISO file of the operating system you want to install.
5. Click **Virtual Media** > **Launch virtual media** in the virtual console window. A pop-up window displays.
6. Click **Add Image...**  and select the ISO file containing your operating system. Keep the window open.
7. Go back to the virtual console window and click **Power** > **Reboot** to restart the machine.
8. During the boot process, press **F11** to access the BIOS boot manager.

9. Select **Virtual CD** to boot the server using the ISO file mounted in the virtual CD drive.

      The boot process may take a while, depending on your internet connection's available upstream bandwidth.
