Scaleway [Instances](/compute/instances/concepts/#instance) are computing units that provide you with resources to run your applications. After you have created your Instance and installed your image of choice (e.g., an operating system), you can connect to it via SSH to use it as you wish. When you are done using the Instance, you can delete it from your account.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)

## How to create an Instance

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The [Instance dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) displays.
2. Click **Create Instance**. The [Instance creation page](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) displays.
3. Complete the following steps:
    - Choose an **Availability Zone**, which represents the geographical region where your Instance will be deployed.
    - Choose an **Instance type**. <br />
      Instance offers vary in pricing, processing power, memory, storage, and bandwidth. [Discover the best Instance type for your needs](/compute/instances/reference-content/choosing-instance-type/).
    - Choose an **Image** to run on your Instance. <br />
      This can be an operating system, an InstantApp, or a custom image. [Check all available Linux distributions and InstantApps](https://www.scaleway.com/en/imagehub/).
    - Add **Volumes**, which are storage spaces used by your Instances.
      - For **GP1 Instances** you can leave the default settings of maximum local storage, or choose how much [local](/compute/instances/concepts/#local-volumes) and/or [block](/compute/instances/concepts/#block-volumes) storage you want. Your **system volume** is the volume on which your Instance will boot. The system volume can be either a local or a block volume.
      - **PLAY2**, **PRO2**, and **Enterprise** Instances boot directly [on block volumes](/compute/instances/concepts/#boot-on-block). You can add several block volumes and define how much storage you want for each.
      <Message type="important">
          - Ensure that a volume with an OS image has a minimum capacity of 10 GB. For a GPU OS, the recommended size is 125 GB.
          - When multiple Block Storage volumes are linked to your Instance, the primary volume will host the OS and is essential for booting the Instance. Once the Instance is created can [modify your boot volume](/compute/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes/#how-to-change-the-boot-volume).
          - Booting from a volume that either lacks an OS or is among multiple volumes with identical operating systems can lead to inconsistent boot outcomes.
      </Message>
    - Configure the network of the Instance. You can either select to use **Routed public IP** (a dedicated public IP address routed to your Instance that allows direct communication between the Instance and the Internet) or a **NAT public IP** (a public IP address that uses a carrier-grade NAT to translate the Instances NAT IP address). If you are unsure which to use, we recommend a routed public IP for ease of use and improved performance.
      - Leave the checkbox ticked to assign a **Public IPv4** to the Instance. You can either allocate a new IPv4 address or select one or multiple existing IPv4s. Alternatively, uncheck the box if you do not want an IPv4.
      - Leave the checkbox ticked to assign a **Public IPv6** to the Instance. You can either allocate a new IPv6 address or select one or multiple existing IPv46. Alternatively, uncheck the box if you do not want an IPv4.
        <Message type="tip">
          You can attach up to 5 IPs to an Instance, combining IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
        </Message>
    - Enter a **Name** for your Instance, or leave the randomly-generated name in place. Optionally, you can add [tags](/compute/instances/concepts/#tags) to help you organize your Instance.
    - Click **Advanced options** if you want to configure a [cloud-init configuration](/compute/instances/concepts/#cloud-init). Otherwise, leave these options at their default values.
    - Verify the [SSH keys](/console/account/concepts/#ssh-key) that will give you access to your Instance.
    - Verify the **Estimated cost** of your Instance, based on the specifications you chose.
4. Click **Create Instance**. The creation of your Instance begins, and you will be informed when the Instance is ready.

## How to connect to an Instance

### How to connect from OSX (Mac) and Linux

1. Open a terminal program.
2. Enter the command below into the terminal. Make sure you replace `your_private_key` with the filename of your private key (often `id_rsa`) and `your_instance_ip` with the IP address of your Instance.
    ```sh
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_private_key root@your_instance_ip
    ```
3. If / when prompted, allow connection to the host by typing `yes`, then press **Enter**.
    ```
    The authenticity of host 'myhost.ext (212.47.226.35)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is 4f:ba:65:cf:14:64:a7:1e:b6:07:7c:00:71:95:21:fa.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
    ```

You are now connected to your Instance.


### How to connect from Windows

To connect to your Instance from Windows, you will need to use a small application called **PuTTY**, an SSH client.

1. Download and install PuTTY [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
2. Launch PuTTY on your computer.
3. Enter your Instance's IP address in the **Hostname** field.
4. In the side menu, under **Connection**, navigate to the **Auth** sub-category. (**Connection** > **SSH** > **Auth**).
5. Click the **Browse** button and select the private key file you [created previously](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/).
6. Click **Open** at the bottom of the screen to open a connection to the Instance. PuTTY asks you to allow the connection to the host.
7. Click **OK** to confirm. The terminal window displays.
8. Enter the username `root` and press **Enter** to authenticate against the server with your SSH key.

    You are now connected to your Instance.


## How to delete an Instance

<Message type="important">
  Deleting an Instance will destroy all the volumes and data stored on that Instance. Note that your Instance must be powered off or stopped to be deleted.
</Message>

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The [Instances page](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) displays.
2. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the Instance you want to delete, and select **Delete** from the drop-down menu. A pop-up asks you to confirm the action.
3. Type **DELETE** and then click **Delete Instance**.
