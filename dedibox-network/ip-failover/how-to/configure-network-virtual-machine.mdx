When you install your server with a virtualization solution like Proxmox you can create multiple virtual machines on the physical server.

This can be used to have separate environments to divide between your different services (for example, keeping mail and web services on different VMs) or to launch several virtual machines to make better use of the performance of the server.

To communicate on the Internet, each of your virtual machines needs an IP address. You can use failover IP's to have additional IP addresses available for your server.

<Message type="tip">
  You can configure a unique gateway for your virtual machines, allowing them to move between hypervisors without changing their network configuration.

  * IP address of the unique gateway: `62.210.0.1`

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- [Created](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/order-a-server) a Dedibox dedicated server and installed a hypervisor on it
- Ordered a [failover IP](/dedibox-network/ip-failover/concepts/#failover-ips)
- Generated a [virtual MAC address](/dedibox-network/ip-failover/concepts/#virtual-mac-address)

Find below examples of network interface configurations on different distributions inside a virtual machine:

## Ubuntu

Since the release of version 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) Ubuntu has switched to Netplan for the configuration of network interfaces. For older releases of the distribution, refer to the configuration for Debian.

1. Log into your virtual machine and open the network configuration file `/etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml` in a text editor of your choice, for example `nano`:
    ```
    sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
    ```
2. Create a network configuration as follows. Remember to replace `fail.over.ip.address` with your failover IP address:
    ```yaml
    network:
        version: 2
        renderer: networkd
        ethernets:
            eth0:
            dhcp4: no
            dhcp6: no
            addresses: [fail.over.ip.address/32]
            gateway4: 62.210.0.1
            nameservers:
              addresses: [ "51.159.47.28", "51.159.47.26" ] # Replace the IP of the DNS cache server with the one located in the same physical location as your machine for optimal performances (https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/console/account/reference-content/scaleway-network-information/#dns-cache-servers)

            routes:
            - to: 62.210.0.1/32
              via: fail.over.ip.address
              scope: link
    ```
3. Save the file and exit the text editor.
4. Apply the new configuration:
    ```
    sudo netplan apply
    ```

## Debian

1. Log into the virtual machine and edit the file `/etc/network/interfaces/` with a text editor of your choice, for example, `nano`:
    ```
    nano /etc/network/interfaces
    ```
2. Configure the network interface as follows. Remember to replace `fail.over.ip.address` with your failover IP address:
    ```
    auto eth0
        iface eth0 inet static
        address fail.over.ip.address
        netmask 255.255.255.255
        pointopoint 62.210.0.1
        gateway 62.210.0.1
    ```
3. Save the file and exit the text editor.
4. Set the DNS server information by editing the file `/etc/resolv.conf`:
    ```
    nano /etc/resolv.conf
    ```
5. Set the DNS resolver by adding the following lines to the file. Then save it and exit the text editor:
    ```
    nameserver 51.159.47.28
    nameserver 51.159.47.26
    ```

    <Message typ="tip">
      The DNS resolvers above are operated by Scaleway. You can also set your preferred alternative DNS resolvers in the file.
    </Message>
6. Activate the network on your virtual machine by running the following code:
    ```
    ifup eth0
    ```

## CentOS

1. Log into the virtual machine and edit the file `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0` with a text editor of your choice, for example, `nano`:

    ```
    nano /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
    ```
2. Configure the network interface as follows. Remember to replace `fail.over.ip.address` with your failover IP address and `virtual:mac:address` with the virtual MAC of the VM:
    ```
    DEVICE=eth0
    BOOTPROTO=none
    ONBOOT=yes
    USERCTL=no
    IPV6INIT=no
    PEERDNS=yes
    TYPE=Ethernet
    NETMASK=255.255.255.255
    IPADDR=fail.over.ip.address
    GATEWAY=62.210.0.1
    DNS1=51.159.47.28
    DNS2=51.159.47.26
    ARP=yes
    HWADDR=virtual:mac:address
    ```
3. Save the file and close the text editor.
4. Edit the file `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-eth0` as follows, then save and exit the text editor:
    ```
    62.210.0.1 dev eth0
    default via 62.210.0.1 dev eth0
    ```
5. Run the following command to bring the network interface up:
    ```
    ifup eth0
    ```

## Windows Server

1. Connect to the desktop of your VM in the virtual console, then open the network settings of your server.
2. Enter the following information in the network adapter configuration:
    * Address: failover IP
    * Subnetmask: `255.255.255.255`
    * Gateway: `62.210.0.1`
    * DNS 1: `51.159.47.28`
    * DNS 2: `51.159.47.26`
