Managed Inference endpoints now return usage stats (number of tokens in prompt, completion and totals) both for streaming and non-streaming responses.

For streaming responses, the usage field is incremented in each chunk and complete in the very last chunk on the response.

More details and example in our [OpenAI API compatibility documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/ai-data/managed-inference/reference-content/openai-compatibility/).
