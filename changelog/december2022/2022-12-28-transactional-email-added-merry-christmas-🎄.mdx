'Twas the night before Christmas and all through the land

The doc team was working, with pens in hand

They sat at their desks, so focused and true

Writing and typing, their work to pursue

The knowledge base was growing, expanding with glee

As the doc team worked hard, just for you, you see

They wanted to help and make things clear

For all those who needed answers, near or far

And when Christmas morning arrived with its cheer

The doc team took a break, to enjoy the good cheer

But they knew they would be back, to work with gusto

Helping users find answers, no matter where they go

Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night

From the doc team, with love and delight!
