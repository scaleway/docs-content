Scaleway Serverless SQL Databases are fully managed databases that automatically scale both in storage and compute according to your workloads.

<Lightbox src="serverless-sql-databases-schema.webp" alt="" />

## Autoscaling

Autoscaling triggers automatically based on your database vCPU consumption:

  - **Scaling up**: after using more than a certain percentage of CPU for several minutes, the vCPU and RAM allocated to your database will increase (up to a maximum of 16 vCPUs and 64 GB RAM)

  - **Scaling down**: after consuming less than a certain percentage of CPU for several minutes, the CPU and RAM allocated to your database will decrease (down to a minimum of 1 vCPU and 4 GB RAM while your database is active)

## Technical specifications

| Specification   | Minimum | Maximum           |
|-----------------|---------|-------------------|
| vCPU            | 0 vCPU  | 16 vCPU           |
| RAM             | 0 GB    | 64 GB (4 GB/vCPU) |
| Storage\*       | 0 GB    | 1 TB              |
| Connections\*\* | 0       | 28                |

\* The maximum storage capacity will increase with upcoming releases.

\*\* The number of maximum connections scales with the allocated vCPUs and RAM, and will increase with upcoming releases. 

## Idle state
After receiving no query for 5 minutes, a Serverless SQL Database will enter into an idle state. It switches from **Running** to **Ready to use**.

While your database is in an idle state, you will not be billed for compute resources (vCPU and RAM). You will however still be billed for storage resources.

## Compatibility

Serverless SQL Database is compatible with most PostgreSQL-compatible clients and tools. Due to connection pooling support, some minor features are disabled or will not work as expected. Check out the [Known differences](/serverless/sql-databases/reference-content/known-differences/)

If you require strict compatibility with all PostgreSQL features, you can use [Managed Databases for PostgreSQL](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/quickstart/) instead.

## Authentication and access management

Authentication and access management is handled directly through [Scaleway IAM](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/) so that you can easily manage all your users and applications accesses in a single place. Refer to [How to connect to a Serverless SQL Database](serverless/sql-databases/how-to/connect-to-a-database/) for more information.

## Configuration requiring manual actions

To avoid any impact on your applications, some actions will require manual actions from you:

- **Major version upgrades (e.g. PostgreSQL 14 -> PostgreSQL 15)**: New PostgreSQL major versions may introduce client-side incompatibilities. To avoid any application downtime, make sure your application code is compatible with the major version you are upgrading to.

- **Restoring backups**: Restoring a backup to your current database will overwrite all current data with the data stored when the backup was performed. If you want to keep your current data, either perform manually a backup of your current database before restoring, or restore your backup to another Serverless SQL Database.

<Message type="note">
    You can automate these actions using APIs, CLI tools or Terraform.

## Actions not managed by Scaleway

Serverless SQL Databases do not automatically handle database usage and optimizations related to your specific data model. You can assess queries performance using any PostgreSQL client or tool, or our integrated SQL editor, using `EXPLAIN` and `ANALYZE` commands. 

The following actions must be performed by you directly:

- **Index creation or rebuild**: you are responsible for creating and managing indexes.

- **Query and data model optimization**: you are responsible for changing database tables structure or queries to optimize performance or storage size.
