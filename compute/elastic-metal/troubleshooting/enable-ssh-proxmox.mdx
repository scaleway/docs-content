Proxmox VE is a complete, open-source server management platform for virtualization. It combines the KVM hypervisor and Linux Containers (LXC), storage and networking features - manageable through a web-based user interface. However SSH connections to the Proxmox VE host are disabled by default for security reasons.

If you require SSH access to your Elastic Metal server, you can enable SSH on your machine after the installation of Proxmox from the Scaleway console.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) 
  - You have [created](/compute/elastic-metal/how-to/create-server) and [installed](/compute/elastic-metal/how-to/install-server) an Elastic Metal server with Proxmox VE
</Message>

1. Log in to the Proxmox web interface of your Elastic Metal server.
    <Message type="tip">
        You can find the URL of the Proxmox VE interface on the overview page of your Elastic Metal server in the Scaleway console.
    </Message>
2. Select your server in the Datacenter view of Proxmox.
3. Click **Shell** in the server view to open a shell in the web interface.
4. Open the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` in a text editor.
5. Go go the line `#PermitRootLogin` and uncomment it by removing the `#`. Change the option to yes:
    ```
    [...]
    PermitRootLogin yes
    [...]
    ```
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox-permit-ssh.webp" alt="" />
6. Save the file and quit the text editor.
7. Restart the SSH service to enable SSH login.
    ```
    systemctl restart ssh
    ```
    You can now use SSH on your Elastic Metal server. Use the login `root` and your Proxmox password when connecting to the machine.
