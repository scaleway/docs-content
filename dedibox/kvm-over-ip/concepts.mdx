## KVM Over IP

KVM Over IP is a hardware-based solution that enables remote access to the **k**eyboard, **v**ideo (screen) and **m**ouse ports of a physical server. A unit plugs into these ports, and transmits their signals to a connected user through a network. This allows access to the machine even if the installed OS is not working properly, and opens up possibilities for debugging and more.
