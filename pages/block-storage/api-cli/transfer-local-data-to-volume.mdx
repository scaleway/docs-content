You can transfer files from your local machine to your Instance's remote Block volume with [rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync), a tool for efficiently transferring and copying files. The rsync utility is pre-installed on most Linux distributions and macOS.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Instance](/instances/concepts/#instance)
- [Attached](/block-storage/how-to/attach-a-volume/) a Block Storage volume to your Instance

1. Check that rsync is installed on your local machine with the following command:
    ```
    rsync --version
    ```

    An output similar to the following displays:

    ```sh no-copy
    rsync  version 3.1.3  protocol version 31

        <Message type="tip">
          If you get a `command not found` output (or similar), you need to install `rsync`:
          - On Linux Ubuntu and Debian systems, you can do this with the APT package tool using the `sudo apt install rsync` command.
          - For Linux CentOS/ Fedora, you can use the YUM package manager: `sudo yum install rsync`.
          - On Mac OSX with the Homebrew package manager, you can use `brew install rsync`.
        </Message>

2. On your local machine, open a new terminal and use the following command to create a file called `hello-world.txt`:
    ```
    nano hello-world.txt
    ```

3. Enter the text `Hello World!`.

4. Press `Ctrl+O`, then `Enter`, then `Ctrl+X` to save and exit the file.

5. Enter the following command to transfer the file to your Instance's mounted block volume. Ensure that you use your own Instance's IP address:

    ```
    rsync -a hello-world.txt root@<your_instance_ip>:/mnt/block-volume
    ```

The file is now transferred. You can connect to your Instance again, and use the command `cd /mnt/block-volume ; ls` to check that the file appears in the directory.
