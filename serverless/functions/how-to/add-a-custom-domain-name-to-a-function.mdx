Each function comes with an automatically generated domain on which it is available. However it is possible to assign your own domain name to make it easier to use your functions.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have a running [Serverless Function](/serverless/functions/how-to/create-a-function/)
  - You have a domain name
  - If you are using **Cloudflare DNS**, please see the note below regarding proxying
</Message>

1. Add a CNAME record pointing to your function's default URL from the [domains dashboard](/network/domains-and-dns/how-to/manage-dns-records/).
2. Click the **Endpoints** tab on your Function's Overview page.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-functions-domain.webp" alt="" />
3. Click **+ Add endpoint**.
4. Enter your custom domain URL and validate the form.
5. Connect to your function using your custom domain once you have checked the CNAME and TLS fields.

<Message type="important">
    Be aware that **Custom Domains** does not currently support websockets. If you need to use websockets you must configure them with the original container URL.

## Cloudflare DNS

If you are using Cloudflare DNS to configure your custom domain, you need to set the `CNAME` record's proxy status to **DNS Only** while adding it to your function. We perform a number of validation checks on our side when configuring your domain, and if the `CNAME` record is proxied during these checks, the checks will fail.

Once you have configured your domain and your function is responding correctly, you can set the `CNAME` record back to `Proxied` if you wish.

The [Cloudflare documentation on Proxy Status](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/) describes how to change the Proxy Status of a `CNAME` record via the Cloudflare web UI.
