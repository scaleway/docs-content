Scaleway's [Serverless Functions](https://www.scaleway.com/en/serverless-functions/) platform makes your [functions](/serverless/functions/concepts/#function) available, executes them on demand and manages resource allocation for you.  

This page explains how to deploy, invoke and delete a basic Python function using the Scaleway Console. For advanced usage, such as larger projects with dependencies, automation, multiple functions, etc., [several ways to deploy functions](/serverless/functions/reference-content/deploy-function/) are available.

Check out our [scaleway/serverless-examples repository](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-examples) for advanced examples and use cases.

## How to create a functions namespace

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.
2. Click **+ Create namespace**. The functions namespace creation wizard displays.
3. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 
    - Enter a **name** and optionally a **description** for your namespace. The name must start with a letter and can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes.
    - Choose a **region**, which is the geographical location in which your namespace will be deployed.
4. Click **Create namespace** to finish.

Your namespace is now created and you are taken to its **Functions** tab.

## How to create a function

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.
2. Click the functions namespace you want to use to create your function.
3. Click **+ Create function**. The function creation wizard displays.
4. Enter your **function code**: 
    - Leave the `handler.handle` default value.
    - Choose either **Node**, **Python** or **PHP** as a runtime.
    - Leave the default code sample in the editor.
    - Choose a **name** for your function, and optionally a **description**. The name can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes.
    - Choose the smallest **resources** available to allocate to your function.
    - Leave the default **scaling** values. The Scaleway platform automatically scales the number of available instances of your function to match the incoming load, depending on the settings you define here.
    - Set the **Function privacy policy** to public.
    - Verify the **estimated cost**.

5. Click **Create function**. The deployment will take several minutes to complete. Check the **Overview** tab to see the function's status.
6. Copy the function's endpoint URL from the **Overview** tab.
7. Run the following command in your terminal to invoke your function once it is deployed:

    ```bash
    curl <YOUR_FUNCTION_ENDPOINT>
    ```

## How to delete a function

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.

3. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the function you want to delete, and select **Delete** from the dropdown menu.
4. Type **DELETE** in the pop-up that asks you to confirm the action, then click **Delete function**.
