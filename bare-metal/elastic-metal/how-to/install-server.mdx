Scaleway [Elastic Metal](https://www.scaleway.com/en/elastic-metal/) allows you to order dedicated servers on-demand, like cloud Instances.
Elastic Metal servers can be used for large workloads, big data and applications that require increased security and dedicated resources.

If you ordered your server without a pre-installed operating system, you can proceed with the installation of an OS once the Elastic Metal server has been delivered to your account.
