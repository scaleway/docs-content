During deployment, each Instance gets a private IP from its hosting node, besides its public IP, which is routed to the Instance through a [carrier-grade NAT](/compute/instances/concepts/#carrier-grade-nat-(cgnat)) solution. However, if the underlying hypervisor changes, the private IP changes. This can happen when you restart your Instance. The private IP lets Instances communicate via the underlying private network, without public IPs. 

Routing a public IP directly to an Instance bypasses private IPs, sending traffic to its [routed flexible IP](/compute/instances/concepts/#routed-flexible-ip). The benefit is the IP stays consistent even if the Instance is restarted or moved. Routed IPs also let you assign multiple flexible IPv4s and IPv6s to an Instance, as both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported.

Using a routed flexible IP is recommended for all compatible Instance types, as it allows precise control over network configurations. It simplifies troubleshooting, ensures compatibility with more applications, and allows for enhanced security monitoring.

<Message type="important">
  * The routed IP feature **is not compatible** with legacy Instance types using the bootscript feature.
  * Using static network configurations during transition can lead to a loss of Internet connectivity (using DHCP is advised).
  * You must update the `scaleway-ecosystem` and `cloud-init` packages before starting transition.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) that is not moved to routed IPs
</Message>

1. Select **Instances** from the **Compute** category in the sidebar menu. This will show a list of your Instances. Those eligible for transition to routed IPs can be identified by an exclamation mark icon.

2. Click **Move IP** next to the Instance you wish to move to routed flexible IPs. A pop-up displays.
    <Message type="tip">
      Alternatively, you can initiate the transition from your Instance's overview page by clicking the **Move IP** button.
    </Message>
3. Type **MIGRATE** to confirm your intent and click **Move to routed IP**. This will initiate the transition process, and your Instance will undergo a reboot.
    <Message type="note">
      Post-transition, your Instance will retain its public IP address, but its private IP will be removed.
    </Message>
After the transition finishes, the notification icon will no longer be visible in your Instances list.
