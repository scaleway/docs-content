Structured outputs allow users to get consistent, machine-readable JSON format responses from language models.
JSON, as a widely-used format, enables seamless integration with a variety of platforms and applications. Its interoperability is crucial for developers aiming to incorporate AI functionality into their current systems with minimal adjustments.

By specifying a response format when using the Chat Completions API or Responses API, you can ensure that responses are returned in a JSON structure.
There are two main modes for generating JSON: **Object Mode** (schemaless) and **Schema Mode** (deterministic, structured output).

There are several ways to interact with language models:
- The Scaleway [console](https://console.scaleway.com) provides a complete [playground](/generative-apis/how-to/query-language-models/#accessing-the-playground), aiming to test models, adapt parameters, and observe how these changes affect the output in real-time.
- Via the [Chat Completions API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/generative-apis/#path-chat-completions-create-a-chat-completion) or the [Responses API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/generative-apis/#path-responses-beta-create-a-response)

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) for API authentication
- Python 3.7+ installed on your system

## Types of structured outputs

- **Structured outputs (schema mode)**:
   - Type `{"type": "json_schema"}`
   - This mode enforces a strict schema format, where the output adheres to the predefined structure.
   - Supports complex types and validation mechanisms as per the [JSON schema specification](https://json-schema.org/specification/), including nested schemas composition (`anyOf`, `allOf`, `oneOf` etc), `$ref`, `all` types, and regular expressions.

- **JSON mode** (Legacy method):
   - Type: `{"type": "json_object"}`
   - This mode is non-deterministic and allows the model to output a JSON object without strict validation.
   - Useful for flexible outputs when you expect the model to infer a reasonable structure based on your prompt.
   - JSON mode is older and has been used by developers since early API implementations, but lacks reliability in response formats.

<Message type="note">
    - All LLMs in the Scaleway library support **Structured outputs** and **JSON mode**. However, a schemaless **JSON mode** will produce lower quality results and is not recommended. Note that structured output is more reliably validated and more richly parsed with the Responses API.

## Code examples

<Message type="tip">
    Before diving into the code examples, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
    ```bash
    pip install openai pydantic
    ```
</Message>

The following Python examples demonstrate how to use **Structured outputs** to generate structured responses.

We using the base code below to send our LLM a voice note transcript to structure:

### Defining the voice note and transcript

    ```python
    import json
    from openai import OpenAI
    from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

    # Set your preferred model
    MODEL = "llama-3.1-8b-instruct" ## or "gpt-oss-120b" for the Responses API

    # Set your API key
    API_KEY = "<SCW_API_KEY>"

    client = OpenAI(
        base_url="https://api.scaleway.ai/v1",
        api_key=API_KEY,
    )

    # Define the schema for the output using Pydantic
    class VoiceNote(BaseModel):
        title: str = Field(description="A title for the voice note")
        summary: str = Field(description="A short one sentence summary of the voice note.")
        actionItems: list[str] = Field(description="A list of action items from the voice note")

    # Transcript to use for the output
    TRANSCRIPT = ( 
        "Good evening! It's 6:30 PM, and I'm just getting home from work. I have a few things to do " 
        "before I can relax. First, I'll need to water the plants in the garden since they've been in the sun all day. " 
        "Then, I'll start preparing dinner. I think a simple pasta dish with some garlic bread should be good. " 
        "While that's cooking, I'll catch up on a couple of phone calls I missed earlier."
    )
    ```

### Using structured outputs with JSON schema (Pydantic)

Using [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/models/), users can define the schema as a Python class and enforce the model to return results adhering to this schema.

        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "The following is a voice message transcript. Only answer in JSON using '{' as the first character.",
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": TRANSCRIPT,
            },
        ],
        model=MODEL,
        response_format={
            "type": "json_schema",
            "json_schema": {
                "name": "VoiceNote",
                "schema": VoiceNote.model_json_schema(),
            }
        },
    )
    output = json.loads(extract.choices[0].message.content)
    print(json.dumps(output, indent=2))
    ```

    Output example:
    ```json
    {
    "title": "To-Do List",
    "summary": "Returning from work, need to complete tasks before relaxing",
    "actionItems": [
        "Water garden",
        "Prepare dinner: pasta dish with garlic bread",
        "Catch up on missed phone calls"
    ]
    }
    ```
    </TabsTab>
    <TabsTab label="Responses API (Beta)">
    ```python

    extract = client.responses.create(
        input=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "The following is a voice message transcript. Only answer in JSON using '{' as the first character.",
            },
            {

        model=MODEL,
        text={
            "format": {
                "type": "json_schema",

        "summary": "The user plans to water plants, cook dinner, and make phone calls after arriving home at 6:30\u202fPM.",
        "title": "Evening Tasks"
    }
    ```

<Message type="tip">
    Structured outputs accuracy may vary between models. For instance, with Llama models, we suggest adding a description of the field looked for in `response_format` and in `system` or `user` messages. In our example this would mean adding a system prompt similar to:
    ```bash
    "content": "The following is a voice message transcript. Provide the message title, summary and action items. Only answer in JSON using '{' as the first character.",
    ```
    For additional optimization or troubleshooting, see [Structured output (e.g., JSON) is not working correctly](/generative-apis/troubleshooting/fixing-common-issues/#structured-output-eg-json-is-not-working-correctly).
</Message>

### Using structured outputs with JSON schema (manual definition)

Alternatively, users can manually define the JSON schema inline when calling the model. See below an example for doing this with the Chat Completions API:

```python
extract = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "The following is a voice message transcript. Only answer in JSON using '{' as the first character.",
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": TRANSCRIPT,
        },
    ],
    model=MODEL,
    response_format={
        "type": "json_schema",
        "json_schema": {
            "name": "VoiceNote", 
            "schema": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "title": {"type": "string"},
                    "summary": {"type": "string"},
                    "actionItems": {
                        "type": "array",
                        "items": {"type": "string"}
                    }
                },
                "additionalProperties": False,
                "required": ["title", "summary", "actionItems"]
            }
        }
    }
)
output = json.loads(extract.choices[0].message.content)
print(json.dumps(output, indent=2))
```

Output example:
```json
{
"title": "Evening Routine",
"actionItems": [
    "Water the plants",
    "Cook dinner (pasta and garlic bread)",
    "Make phone calls"
],
"summary": "Made a list of tasks to accomplish before relaxing tonight"
}
```

<Message type="tip">
  When using the OpenAI SDKs like in the examples above, you are expected to set `additionalProperties` to false, and to specify all your properties as required.
</Message>

### Using JSON mode (schemaless, Legacy method)

<Message type="important">
  JSON mode: It is important to explicitly ask the model to generate a JSON output either in the system prompt or user prompt. To prevent infinite generations, model providers most often encourage users to ask the model for short JSON objects. Prompt example: `Only answer in JSON using '{' as the first character.`.
</Message>

In JSON mode, you can prompt the model to output a JSON object without enforcing a strict schema. See below an example for the Chat Completions API:

```python
extract = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "The following is a voice message transcript. Only answer in JSON using '{' as the first character.",
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": TRANSCRIPT,
        },
    ],
    model=MODEL,
    response_format={
        "type": "json_object",
    },
)
output = json.loads(extract.choices[0].message.content)
print(json.dumps(output, indent=2))
```

Output example:
```json
{
"current_time": "6:30 PM",
"tasks": [
    {
    "task": "water the plants in the garden",
    "priority": "high"
    },
    {
    "task": "prepare dinner (pasta with garlic bread)",
    "priority": "high"
    },
    {
    "task": "catch up on phone calls",
    "priority": "medium"
    }
]
}
```

## Conclusion

Using structured outputs with LLMs can significantly improve their reliability, especially to implement agentic use cases.

- **Structured outputs** provide strict adherence to a predefined schema, ensuring consistency.
- **JSON mode** (Legacy Method) is flexible but less predictable.

We recommend using structured outputs (`json_schema`) for most use cases.
