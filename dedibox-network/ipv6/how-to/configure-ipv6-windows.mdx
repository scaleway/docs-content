- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- A [Dedibox dedicated server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox)
- [Requested](/dedibox-network/ipv6/how-to/request-prefix) a /48 IPv6 prefix

<Message type="important">
  * On servers supporting [IPv6 SLAAC](/dedibox-network/ipv6/how-to/enable-ipv6-slaac), SLAAC has to be enabled in order to ensure that DHCPv6 works correctly.
  * This documentation addresses the setup of a /48 IPv6 network on your Dedibox. If you intend to use only the SLAAC IP address, no additional configuration is necessary, and your machine can acquire its IP address automatically.

## How to set the DUID in the Windows Registry

<Message type="important">
  Modifying values in the Windows Registry may cause damage to your installation. Be careful when editing these settings.
</Message>

1. Launch the **Registry Editor** by typing `regedit.exe` in the start menu:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_ipv6_regedit.webp" width="" />
2. Scroll down until you reach the following setting: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\services\TCPIP6\Parameters` and edit the value `Dhcpv6DUID` with the DUID of your block by double clicking on the default value:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_ipv6_regedit_edit.webp" width="" />

## How to configure IPv6 connectivity

1. Go to your network settings, and double-click on your internet connection.
2. Open the connection details and enter the IPv6 settings. Set the IP of the machine to an IPv6 address of your subnet and the netmask:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_ipv6_config_win.webp" alt="" />
3. Once you have saved the configuration, open a terminal and test the connection by running a `ping -6 google.com` or `tracert -6 google.com`:
