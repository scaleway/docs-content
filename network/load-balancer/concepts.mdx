## ACL

<Macro id="acls" />

 Learn how to use the ACL feature in our [dedicated how-to](/network/load-balancer/how-to/create-manage-acls/) and go deeper with our [reference documentation](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/acls/)

## Accessibility

When creating a Load Balancer, you are prompted to configure its **accessibility**. There are two options: **private** or **public**:

  - **Private**: A private Load Balancer has no public IP address, and is only accessible from the Private Network(s) it is attached to. Read more about [private Load Balancers](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/public-private-accessibility/#private-load-balancers).
  - **Public**: A public Load Balancer is accessible from the internet via its public IP address.

Accessibility cannot be modified after creation of the Load Balancer.

## Backends

Each Load Balancer is configured with one or several backends. A backend represents a set of [backend servers](#backend-servers) that the Load Balancer's frontend forwards requests to using the specified configuration (port, protocol, Proxy Protocol etc.). Grouping backend servers into a backend allows load to be balanced between them based on a defined load-balancing algorithm configured as a backend setting. You can [add and manage backends via the console](/network/load-balancer/how-to/manage-frontends-and-backends/).

## Backend servers

The term "backend server" designates the final-destination backend servers which the Load Balancer forwards traffic on to. Each of the Load Balancer's [backends](#backends) must specify one or more backend servers (via their IP addresses) to forward to.

## Backend protection

Backend protection is a set of configurable values that allow you to control how load is distributed to backend servers. You can use these settings to configure the **maximum number of simultaneous requests** to a given backend server before it is considered to be at maximum capacity. You can also configure a **queue timeout** value, which defines the maximum amount of time (in ms) to queue a request or connection for a particular backend server when [stickiness](#sticky-session) is enabled. Once this value is reached, the request/connection will be directed to a different backend server.

## Balancing methods

Load Balancers support three different modes of balancing load (requests) between backend servers:

* **Round-robin**: Requests are sent to each backend server in turn, with the Load Balancer acting like a turnstile. This is the most frequently used balancing method, and the easiest to implement. It is well-suited to infrastructures that have identical backend servers.
* **Least connections**: Each request is assigned to the server with the fewest active connections. This method works best when it is expected that sessions will be long, e.g. LDAP, SQL TSE. It is less well suited to protocols with typically short sessions like HTTP.
* **First available**: Each request is directed towards the first backend server with available connection slots. Once a server reaches its limit of maximum simultaneous connections, requests are directed to the next server. This method uses the smallest number of servers at any given time, which can be useful if, for example, you sometimes want to power off extra servers during off-peak hours.

For more information about balancing rules, refer to our [blog post "What is a load balancer"](https://www.scaleway.com/en/blog/what-is-a-load-balancer/)

## Certificate

A certificate (aka SSL certificate / TLS certificate / TLS/SSL certificate) is a digital certificate that enables an encrypted connection between a client and a web server.

<Message type="tip">

  You may hear certificates referred to as "SSL certificates", "TLS certificates" or "TLS/SSL certificates". These are all the same thing. SSL (Secured Socket Layer) was the protocol initially used for encryption, though it has now been replaced with TLS (Transport Layer Security).

</Message>

You can [add a certificate](/network/load-balancer/how-to/add-certificate/) to your Load Balancer's frontend to enable the Load Balancer to decrypt/encrypt traffic, necessary for [SSL bridging and SSL offloading configurations](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/ssl-bridging-offloading-passthrough/). Scaleway Load Balancer enables you to generate a Let's Encrypt certificate, or import a third-party or self-signed certificate.

## Connection timeout

Connection timeout is a configurable value for your Load Balancer's backend. It defines the maximum time (in ms) allowed to establish a connection between a client and a backend server.

## Customized error page

With the [customized error page feature](/network/load-balancer/how-to/set-up-s3-failover/), you can redirect users to a static website hosted on Scaleway Object Storage if none of your Load Balancer's backends are available to serve the requested content. This website could be a simple, single webpage or else something much more complex: you build it according to your own requirements.

If you do not set up a customized error page, and none of your backend servers are available, your users will instead see a standard HTTP error displayed in their browser, e.g. `503 Service Unavailable`.

Benefits of using this feature include:
- Displaying customized, branded and user-friendly error messages
- Providing links to support resources or contact information
- Providing information on service status or maintenance
- Redirecting to a mirrored site or skeleton site

## First available

See [balancing-methods](#balancing-methods).

## Frontends

Each Load Balancer is configured with one or several frontends. Frontends listen on a configured port, and forward requests to one or several backends. You can [add and manage frontends via the console](/network/load-balancer/how-to/manage-frontends-and-backends/).

## Flexible IP address

Flexible IP addresses are public IP addresses that you can hold independently of any Load Balancer. By default, each Load Balancer is created automatically with a flexible IP address, that the frontend listens to. In case of a failure of the Load Balancer, a replica Load Balancer is immediately spawned and deployed, and the flexible IP address is automatically rerouted to this replica.

Find out how to create and manage flexible IP addresses in our [dedicated how-to](/network/load-balancer/how-to/create-manage-flex-ips/).

## Health checks

Load Balancers should only forward traffic to “healthy” backend servers. To monitor the health of a backend server, health checks regularly attempt to communicate with backend servers using the protocol and port defined by the forwarding rules to ensure that servers are listening. Various protocols for health checks are available, including HTTP, HTTPS, MySQL, and more.

Read more about health checks, including the advanced settings available, in our [dedicated documentation](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/configuring-health-checks/).

## High availability

A high availability (HA) setup is an infrastructure without a single point of failure. It prevents a server failure by adding redundancy to every layer of your architecture.

## HTTP headers

HTTP headers are a list of strings in the format `header-name: value` used by the client and server to send and receive additional information between themselves for each HTTP request and response. Headers give more details about the client request, the targeted resources, the request response, and other options desired for that particular connection between client and server. There are [approximately 100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields/) different HTTP header fields.

Scaleway Load Balancers can use the **Host** header field to define [routes](#routes) from a frontend to a specified HTTP backend. HTTP headers can also be used in [ACLs](#acl) to **allow**, **deny** or **redirect** traffic based on the specified header field and value.

## HTTP/2 and HTTP/3

HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 are newer, improved versions of the "classic" HTTP/1 protocol. Scaleway Load Balancers support HTTP/2 connections to frontends, and HTTP/2 connections from backends to backend servers. In addition, Scaleway Load Balancers support HTTP/3 connections to frontends, but do not support HTTP/3 connections from backends to backend servers.

Read more about HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 and how they can be configured on Scaleway Load Balancers in our [dedicated documentation](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/http2-http3/).

## IPv4

Internet Protocol Version 4 is the standard protocol used for IP addresses, and routes most Internet traffic as of today. Each IPv4 address has 32 bits. Written in human-readable form, an IPv4 address is generally shown as four octets of numbers separated by periods, e.g. `192.0.2.1`.

When you [create a public (flexible) IP address for a Load Balancer](/network/load-balancer/how-to/create-manage-flex-ips/), this address can use either IPv4 or IPv6 protocol. An IPv4 address is obligatory for all public Load Balancers, but an IPv6 address can be optionally added.

## IPv6

Internet Protocol Version 6 is the most recent version of the IP protocol used for IP addresses. Each IPv6 address has 128 bits. Written in human-readable form, an IPv6 address can be shown as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, each group representing 16 bits and separated by a colon, e.g. `1050:0000:0000:0000:0005:0600:300c:326b`. This can also be notated as `1050:0:0:0:5:600:300c:326b` by omitting leading zeros.

When you [create a public (flexible) IP address for a Load Balancer](/network/load-balancer/how-to/create-manage-flex-ips/), this address can use either IPv4 or IPv6 protocol. An IPv4 address is obligatory for all public Load Balancers, but an IPv6 address can be optionally added.

## Kubernetes Load Balancer

When you create a `LoadBalancer` service within your [Scaleway Kubernetes cluster](/containers/kubernetes/quickstart/), the Scaleway Cloud Controller Manager will spin up an external Scaleway Load Balancer with the correct configuration to expose the specified service in your cluster.

The process for creating and managing Load Balancers for Kubernetes clusters is very specific - you **cannot** create or edit these via the Scaleway console or API. For full instructions on how to correctly create and configure a Scaleway Load Balancer for a Kubernetes cluster, see our [dedicated documentation](/containers/kubernetes/reference-content/kubernetes-load-balancer/).

## Least connections

See [balancing-methods](#balancing-methods).

## Load Balancers

[Load Balancers](/network/load-balancer/how-to/create-load-balancer/) are highly available and fully managed instances that allow you to distribute workload across multiple servers. They ensure the scaling of all your applications while securing their continuous availability, even in the event of heavy traffic. They are commonly used to improve the performance and reliability of websites, applications, databases and other services.

## Private Load Balancer

A Load Balancer is defined as private when you choose the "private" [accessibility](#accessibility) option during Load Balancer creation. A Private Load Balancer has no public IP address, and only listens to requests or connections sent through the Private Network(s) to which it is attached. Read more about private Load Balancers and their characteristics and limitations in our [dedicated documentation](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/public-private-accessibility/#private-load-balancers).

## Protocol

A protocol is a standard format for communication over a network. When you configure your Load Balancer's backend, you choose a protocol (HTTP, HTTPs or TCP) which it uses to send and receive data.

## Proxy Protocol

Proxy Protocol is an internet protocol used to transfer connection information from the client (e.g. the client's IP address), through the Load Balancer and on to the destination server. For full information, see our [dedicated documentation](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/configuring-backends/#proxy-protocol).

## Round-robin

See [balancing-methods](#balancing-methods).

## Routes

Routes allow you to specify, for a given frontend, which of its backends it should direct traffic to. For [HTTP](#protocol) frontends/backends, routes are based on HTTP Host headers. For [TCP](#protocol) frontends/backends, they are based on **S**erver **N**ame **I**dentification (SNI). You can configure multiple routes on a single Load Balancer.

## S3 failover

See [customized error page](#customized-error-page)

## Server Name Identification (SNI)

SNI allows the server to host multiple [SSL/TLS certificates](#certificate) for multiple sites/applications on the same IP address and port number. It works as an extension to the [TLS](/network/load-balancer/concepts/#protocol) protocol: the client/browser specifies which hostname it is requesting at the start of the TLS handshake, allowing the server to respond appropriately.

Scaleway Load Balancers can use SNI to define [routes](#routes) from a frontend to a specified TCP backend.

## Server timeout

Server timeout is a configurable value for your Load Balancer's backend. It defines the maximum allowed time (in ms) that a backend server has to process a request.

## SSL bridging

[SSL bridging](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/ssl-bridging-offloading-passthrough/) describes a configuration pattern where the Load Balancer terminates encrypted connections at the frontend (decrypting incoming traffic) before initiating a new encrypted connection to the backend before forwarding traffic.

## SSL offloading

[SSL offloading](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/ssl-bridging-offloading-passthrough/) describes a pattern where the Load Balancer terminates encrypted connections at the frontend (decrypting incoming traffic), with the intention to forward it unencrypted to the backend servers. This effectively "offloads" the work of decrypting traffic from the backend server to the Load Balancer.

## SSL passthrough

[SSL passthrough](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/ssl-bridging-offloading-passthrough/) is the simplest way to handle HTTPS traffic on a Load Balancer. As the name suggests, traffic is simply passed through the Load Balancer without being decrypted.

## Sticky session

A sticky session enables the Load Balancer to bind a user's session to a specific server in the backend pool. This ensures that all subsequent sessions from the user are sent to the same backend server while there is at least one active session. Sticky sessions can be **cookie-based** or **table-based**.

- **Cookie-based** stickiness uses an HTTP cookie to identify a session, and the server in the backend pool that it will stick to. For each incoming request without a stickiness cookie, the Load Balancer creates a cookie and selects a backend for the session. Subsequent requests providing this cookie will land on the same backend. You can customize the name of the cookie.
- **Table-based** (aka **IP-based**) stickiness uses the source (client) IP address to stick sessions to backends.

By default, when activating sticky sessions through the console, the cookie-based method is used when HTTP protocol is selected, and the table-based method is used when TCP protocol is selected. Use the [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/load-balancer/zoned-api/) if you want to select table-based stickiness with HTTP protocol.

## Tunnel timeout

Tunnel timeout is a configurable value for your Load Balancer's backend. It defines the maximum allowed tunnel inactivity time (in ms) between a client and a backend server after a Websocket is established. This value takes precedence over client and server timeout in determining when to close the connection.

## Verify certificate

The [Verify Certificate configuration](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/configuring-backends/#verify-certificate) is relevant to Load Balancers with backends using HTTPS protocol, and specifies whether the Load Balancer should check the backend server's [certificate](#certificate) before initiating a connection.
