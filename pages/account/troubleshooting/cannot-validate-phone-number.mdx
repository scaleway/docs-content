## Problem
I can't validate my phone number on the Scaleway console.

### Symptoms
- You received the error message 'An error occurred' when trying to validate your phone number
- You get stuck at step 2/4 of the phone number validation process
- Your account is locked due to a lack of phone number validation that can't be completed

### Possible causes
- You have made too many attempts at validating your phone number in a short period, and the service was temporarily blocked
- Your phone number is from a country not currently supported by Scaleway

### Solutions
- Ensure you are entering your phone number with the correct country code
- Use the correct format containing the country code with two digits, followed by all the phone number digits, with no dashes or spaces: `+00 123456789`.
- Ensure your phone number is from a [country supported by Scaleway](/billing/troubleshooting/cannot-find-my-country)
- If none of these work, [contact our Support team](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create) for a manual unlock.
