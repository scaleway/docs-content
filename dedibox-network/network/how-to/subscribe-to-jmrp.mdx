By subscribing to the JMRP (Junk Mail Reporting Program), you can register your IPs with Microsoft's mail delivery system. This registration enables you to take appropriate actions in case your IP is identified as a source of spam, preventing it from getting blacklisted.

By default, the authorities use the IP owner's information (Scaleway/Online.net) to determine the association of a mail address with a specific IP.

However, if you have properly [configured the reverse DNS of your IP](/dedibox-network/ip-failover/how-to/configure-reverse-dns), you can select an email address within your domain.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage your IP reputation and maintain a clean email delivery system.
