Qdrant Hybrid Cloud is a fully managed vector database that seamlessly integrates with existing Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule environments. It enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) through Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), enabling precise and context-rich responses in real-time.

In deploying RAG applications, safeguarding sensitive or proprietary data is paramount, underscoring the need for data sovereignty.
By hosting the entire stack within your environment, you retain control over your data.
Qdrant Hybrid Cloud on Scaleway offers a secure and scalable solution that meets data sovereignty requirements while maximizing the potential of RAG for advanced AI solutions.

Key benefits of running Qdrant Hybrid Cloud on Scaleway include:

- **AI-Focused resources:** Scaleway provides dedicated resources and infrastructure tailored for AI and machine learning workloads, complementing Qdrant Hybrid Cloud to empower advanced AI applications.
- **Scalable vector search:** Qdrant Hybrid Cloud's fully managed vector database facilitates seamless scaling, whether vertically or horizontally. Deployed on Scaleway, it ensures robust scalability for projects of any scale, from startups to enterprises.
- **European roots and focus:** Scaleway's presence in Europe aligns well with Qdrant's European roots, offering local expertise and infrastructure that adhere to European regulatory standards.
- **Sustainability commitment:** Scaleway focuses on sustainability with eco-conscious data centers and an extended hardware lifecycle, reducing the environmental impact.
