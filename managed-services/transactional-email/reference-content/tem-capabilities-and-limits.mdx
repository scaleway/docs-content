This page provides information about the capabilities and limits of Scaleway Transactional Email service, depending on user quotas.

Every [Organization](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#organization) has quotas, which are limits on the number of Scaleway resources they can use. Below is a list of basic quotas available for Transactional Email.

<Message type="note">
 - Additional quotas can be added on a case-by-case basis. If you have already validated your payment method and your identity and want to increase your quota beyond the values shown on this page, [contact our support team](https://console.scaleway.com/support/create/)
 - Starting from December 1st 2023, Transactional Email no longer applies an hourly quota for your email sending.
