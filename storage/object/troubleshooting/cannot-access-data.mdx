- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## Problem

I am experiencing issues while trying to access my buckets and objects stored on Scaleway Object Storage.

## Solution

- Go to the [Status page](https://status.scaleway.com/) to see if there is an ongoing incident on the Scaleway infrastructure.

- Retrieve the logs of your buckets using any S3-compatible tool to identify the cause of the problem:
    - [Rclone](https://rclone.org/docs/#logging/)
    - [S3cmd](https://s3tools.org/usage/)
    - [MinIO Client](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc-admin/mc-admin-logs.html#mc-admin-logs/)
    - [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/logs/get-log-events.html/)

- Make sure there is no [bucket policy](/storage/object/concepts/#bucket-policy) that prevents you from deleting the bucket. If there is one, make sure that it [explicitly allows you](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/) to perform the desired action.

- Make sure that [Object lock](/storage/object/api-cli/object-lock/) has not been enabled on the bucket you try to access.

## Going further

If you did not manage to identify the error and solve it by yourself, [open a support ticket](/console/account/how-to/open-a-support-ticket/), and provide as many details as possible, along with the necessary information below:
    - S3 Endpoint (e.g. `s3.fr-par.scw.cloud`)
    - Bucket name
    - Object name (if the request concerns an object)
    - Request type (PUT, GET, etc.)
    - HTTP status code
    - Date and time (timestamp)
    - User-agent (SDK, client, console, etc.)
    - Transaction ID (if possible)
    - Log / trace of the error (if possible)
