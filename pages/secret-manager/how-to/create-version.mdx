When creating a secret, its value is stored in its first version, which is [enabled](/secret-manager/concepts/#enabling-a-version) by default. At creation, your secret only has one version.

This page explains how to add more [versions](/secret-manager/concepts/#version) to a secret using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Generated an API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) and enabled the `SecretManagerFullAccess` [permission set](/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/)
- Created a [secret](/secret-manager/how-to/create-secret/)

1. Click **Secret Manager** in the **Security and Identity** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu.
2. Select the [region](/secret-manager/concepts/#region) in which the secret you want to update is, in the **Region** drop-down.
3. Access the secret that you want to add a version to. Your secret's **Overview** tab displays.
4. Click the **Versions** tab.
5. Click **+ Create version**. A pop-up displays.
6. Add your version:

    - manually
    - import it from a file
    - or click **Copy from latest version** to restore your latest enabled version

7. Optionally, if you have selected **Copy from latest version** and applied the **Single access** ephemeral policy to your secret, click **Copy from latest version** to acknowledge the information displayed in the yellow banner, and confirm.
      <Message type="important">
        - Restoring a former version of a secret where you have applied the **Single access** ephemeral policy counts as an access, meaning it will then be disabled and/or deleted depending on the policies applied.
        - By default, all your secret versions have the same type as the secret they belong to. You cannot change the type after you have created the secret.

8. Click the <Icon name="toggle" /> icon if you want to [enable](/secret-manager/concepts/#enabling-a-version) the version.
9. Click **Create version**.
