<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

<Message type="important">
  This procedure refers to legacy block volumes. To low latency block volumes, refer to the [dedicated documentation](/block-storage/how-to/create-a-volume/).

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The [Instances page](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) displays.
2. Click the **Volumes** tab to display a list of all your current volumes.
3. Click **Create volume** to create a volume that can be attached to any of your Instances.
4. Choose an Availability Zone for the volume.
    <Message type="important">
      The volume must be in the same Availability Zone as the Instance you want to connect it to.
    </Message>
5. Enter the volume name and select a size.
6. Configure the volume type. You can either create a **Block Storage** or **Local NVMe storage** volume.
  <Message type="note">
    To use **[Block Storage Low Latency](/block-storage/) 15k**, your Instance must have at least **3 GiB/s of block bandwidth**.
    You can verify if an Instance type meets this requirement by consulting the [Scaleway Instances internet and Block Storage bandwidth overview](/instances/reference-content/instances-bandwidth-overview/) documentation.

    Alternatively, use the [Instances API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/#path-instance-types-list-instance-types) to check the `block_bandwidth` field at `/instance/v1/zones/{zone}/products/servers`.
    This field provides detailed information about block bandwidth for each Instance type, helping you ensure compatibility with high-performance storage.

7. Click **Create volume** to confirm.

<Message type="tip">
  You can also [create](/block-storage/how-to/create-a-volume/) Block Storage volumes from the [Block Storage console section](https://console.scaleway.com/block-storage/).
