For the increased security of your Organization, you can define a maximum duration for credentials (console sessions and API keys) generated inside your Organization. When a maximum duration is set, the risk of leaking credentials is mitigated as the credentials are less likely to be usable at the time of the exposure.

<Message type="important">
  The security measures listed on this page apply to both [Owners](/iam/concepts#owner) and [IAM members](/iam/concepts#members) credentials.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to set a maximum duration for API keys

You can define a maximum duration for all API keys inside your Organization. By default, there is no maximum duration for API keys, but an expiration date can be defined for each API key [during its creation](iam/how-to/create-api-keys) by its creator.


<Message type="information">
     Setting an API keys maximum duration will apply on **all new API keys in the Organization - Owners, Members and Applications**.
    </Message>

1. Go to the [Security](https://console.scaleway.com/settings/security) settings of your Organization.
2. Scroll to the **Credential Limitations** section.
3. Click **Set up API keys duration*. A pop-up appears.
4. Choose the maximum duration for the API keys inside your Organization.
    <Message type="important">
     Setting up a maximum duration for API keys has no effect on API keys created before this action. If you need to review the time-to-live of previously created API keys, you can either:
        - Set up an expiration date, for any API key without expiration date.
        - Or revoke and create a new API key, if the API key already had an expiration date but not compliant with the time-to-live for all API keys in the Organization. It is impossible to change the expiration date of an API key.
    </Message>
5. Click **Confirm**.

The maximum duration is now effective for all newly created API keys on all IAM principals. When creating an API key, users will have to put a duration that is compliant with the maximum duration. API key creations without expiration date, or with an expiration date not compliant with the maximum duration, will result in an error.

## How to edit or remove a maximum duration for API keys


1. Go to the [Security](https://console.scaleway.com/settings/security) settings of your Organization.
2. Scroll to the **Credential Limitations** section.
3. Click **Set up API keys duration*. A pop-up appears.
4. Depending on what you want, you can:
    - Select a new API key maximum duration
    - Stop limiting the duration of API keys in the Organization.
    <Message type="important">
     Similarly to setting a first maximum duration for API keys, editing the duration has no effect on API keys created before this action.
    </Message>
5. Click **Confirm**.


## How to define a maxium duration for console sessions

Console sessions refer to the period when a User is logged in the Scaleway Console and can perform actions - such as viewing, creating and managing resources. Console sessions are initiated when an Owner or a Member authenticates and logs in to the Scaleway Console.
Sessions end when the user logs out, or when they reach their maximum duration without the user actively logging out. In that case, the session is automatically closed and the user is logged out from the Console.
All console sessions have a maximum duration. **By default, without manual set-up, console sessions have a maximum duration of 30 days.** 

<Message type="information">
     Console sessions maximum duration apply for both Owner and members.
    </Message>


1. Go to the [Security](https://console.scaleway.com/settings/security) settings of your Organization.
2. Scroll to the **Credential Limitations** section.
3. Click **Edit console session maximum duration*. A pop-up appears.
4. Choose the maximum duration for the console session inside your Organization
    <Message type="important">
     Setting up a maximum duration for console session will impact all console sessions, including sessions started before this action. When applied, the maximum duration may take up to one hour to take effect.
    </Message>
5. Click **Confirm**.
