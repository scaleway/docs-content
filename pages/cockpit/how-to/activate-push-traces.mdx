This page shows you how to create [traces](/cockpit/concepts/#traces) from the Scaleway console, retrieve traces push path, configure the OpenTelemetry HTTP agent, and push traces.

<Requirements />

  - A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Project

## Create a trace

1. Click **Cockpit** in the **Monitoring** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Cockpit** overview page displays.
2. Click the **Data sources** tab.
3. Click **+ Create custom data source**. A pop-up displays.
4. Complete the required steps to create your trace:
    - Enter a name
    - Choose the **Traces** data type
    - Select a region to create your trace in
    - Choose your data retention duration (by default traces will be retained for 7 days)
5. Check the estimated cost, then click **Create custom data source**.

## Retrieve traces push paths

Scaleway supports the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/what-is-opentelemetry/) HTTP push path for traces: `/otlp/v1/traces`.

The complete endpoint is `https://<datasource_id>.traces.cockpit.<region>.scw.cloud/otlp/v1/traces`.

You can retrieve your trace's push path (and data source ID) from [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/cockpit/regional-api/#path-data-sources-list-data-sources) or from the Scaleway console:

1. Click **Cockpit** in the **Monitoring** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Cockpit** overview page displays.
2. Click the **Data sources** tab.
3. Click the trace data source of which you want to retrieve the path. The trace's information displays.
4. Retrieve the data source's URL under the **URL** section.
5. Add the push path `/otlp/v1/traces` to the URL.

## Push traces

1. [Create a Cockpit token](/cockpit/how-to/create-token/) with **Push** permissions for traces.
    <Message type="important">
     Your token's secret key displays only once. Make sure that you copy and save it before you exit the page.
    </Message>
2. Configure your applications to send traces to your [preferred endpoint](/cockpit/concepts/#endpoints) using your newly-created token to authenticate.
    <Message type="note">
      You can also configure an agent to push your trace(s). Find out [how to configure the Grafana Alloy agent and push your data](/cockpit/how-to/send-metrics-with-grafana-alloy/)
    </Message>
3. [Create your Grafana credentials](/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/).
4. [Log in to your Grafana account](/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards/).
5. Create your [Grafana dashboard](/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards/) and start monitoring your data.
