## Configuration Restrictions

In order to ensure the proper functioning of the product, we restrict the use of certain ports and environment variables

* Blocked port:

* Forbidden custom ports
  Please don't make your containers listen on these ports which are used by our service.
  * 8008
	* 8012
	* 8013
	* 8022
	* 9090
	* 9091
