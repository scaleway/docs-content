From time to time your Scaleway Managed Databases have to undergo maintenance to make sure that your nodes are up-to-date and have all the tools necessary to maintain a healthy lifecycle. For example, your engine version might need to be upgraded to the latest available minor version, or certain patches might need to be implemented.

These maintenance operations are set up, run, and scheduled by Scaleway, but you can select when to apply them to avoid interruptions during peak times.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [PostgreSQL or MySQL Database Instance](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/quickstart/) scheduled for maintenance

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Look for an orange info icon to identify which Database Instances are scheduled for maintenance.
3. Click the Database Instance name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the database information page.

    If your Database Instance is scheduled for maintenance, you will see a banner on the top of the page informing you when the scheduled maintenance will take place. You can either wait for the maintenance to be applied automatically at the expected date and time, or you can apply it immediately.

    <Message type="important">
      Certain types of maintenance cannot be applied manually, such as hot security patches. In these cases, you will receive an email informing you of the details of the scheduled maintenance, such as the date, time, and on which Database Instance it will be applied. You can also check this information on the Database Instance information page of the Scaleway console.
    </Message>


4. Click **Apply maintenance now** to apply the maintenance immediately. You are redirected to a screen that shows you the status of the maintenance.
    <Message type="important">
      Your Database Instance will be unavailable during the maintenance. This might take a few minutes.
    </Message>

    <Message type="note">
      If you do not apply the maintenance up to 24 hours before it is set to take place, it will be applied automatically on the scheduled date.
    </Message>

    Once maintenance is complete the status of your Database Instance is reset to `Running`.
