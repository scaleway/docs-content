WordPress is a popular, free, and open-source blogging tool and content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MariaDB.

Using the WordPress application can significantly save you time and effort, as it comes pre-installed and configured. By default, the WordPress image used in this tutorial [supports routed IPs](/compute/instances/api-cli/using-routed-ips/).

This guide demonstrates how to quickly deploy a WordPress application in seconds using Scaleway's InstantApp.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended organizations
- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)

<Message type="tip">
 We recommend you follow this tutorial using a [Cost-Optimized Instance](/compute/instances/reference-content/cost-optimized/).
</Message>

<Message type="note">
  The WordPress InstantApp comes with the following packages:
  ```
  nginx
  mariadb-server
  php-cli
  php-fpm
  php-mysql
  ```
  The underlying operating system used is Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, so the package versions are those available on this distribution.

## Auto-install functionality

The WordPress image comes with a new `auto-install` functionality which allows you to create a WordPress Instance using a few well-defined tags.
Tags allow you to provide basic information needed to have a fully working WordPress Instance.

To trigger the auto-install functionality, two mandatory tags are required for full automation:

- `admin_user_name`
- `admin_email`

Optional tags such as `weblog_title`and `language` can also be used to add more customization to the Weblog.

<Message type="note">
  The value for the `language` tag must adhere to the [list of WordPress locale codes](https://wpastra.com/docs/complete-list-wordpress-locale-codes)
</Message>

A random password will be generated and will be accessible when you log into your Instance with your SSH key.
When defining the `weblog_title` tag on the console, it is not possible to have spaces in the title of the weblog. This is only feasible when using the CLI. Refer to our tutorial on [creating a WordPress Instance using the Scaleway CLI](/tutorials/create-wordpress-instances-cli) to create an Instance with the Scaleway CLI.

### Deploy WordPress

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The [Instances page](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) displays.

### Open the mail ports to send emails

To avoid spam, remote mail ports cannot be reached from our infrastructure by default. As WordPress requires sending mail, we need to open them. Your account needs to be validated to perform this operation. [Contact our assistance](https://console.scaleway.com/support/) to get your account reviewed.

1. Click the **Security groups** tab to enter the security groups' page.
2. Click **Create security group** and enter the security group's name and description.
