You now have the option to migrate your Dedibox Web Hosting Cloud (powered by cPanel) to our cutting-edge web hosting service within the Scaleway ecosystem. This new platform offers an intuitive graphical interface to streamline your web hosting management. By making the move to this upgraded system, you'll continue to access all the features included in your current Dedibox Web Hosting Cloud plan, along with the latest updates and performance enhancements for an even better hosting experience.

<Message type="important">
    At present, migration is exclusively available for users with a [Web Hosting Cloud (cPanel) plan](/dedibox-console/cpanel-hosting/quickstart/) in the Dedibox console. Users with a Web Hosting Classic plan will have the opportunity to migrate at a later time.

  We highly recommend utilizing our name servers for a seamless migration experience:
    * `ns1.whm.fr-par.scw.cloud.`
    * `ns2.whm.fr-par.scw.cloud.`
  
  If you are managing your DNS zone by yourself, you can locate all the necessary DNS pointers for configuration within the **DNS verification** tab of your Web Hosting in the Scaleway console.
