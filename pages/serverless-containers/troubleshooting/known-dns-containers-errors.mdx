## Problem

I am encountering DNS errors while using Scaleway Serverless Containers.

## Possible causes
	
The DNS record for the default endpoint (`functions.fnc.<region>.scw.cloud`) is not available yet on every DNS resolver. This issue can appear even a few seconds after the container is marked as “ready”, and mostly appears when the user calls the container too early after the first deployment.

- For custom domains, a DNS resolution failure can indicate that the custom domain is not properly configured.


## Solutions

- When the DNS answer is cached locally, you can:
  - retry later (negative DNS caching lasts around 60 seconds)
  - try from another host, where the DNS answer is not cached
  - clean the DNS cache locally
  - use another DNS resolver (common DNS resolvers should have the record in a few seconds)

- For custom domains:
  - check the configuration on your DNS provider
  - check the TTL on the DNS record. High TTL values will cache the DNS answers for a long time, so we recommend adding a small TTL for setting up the custom domain (60s)
  - make sure [you properly configured your custom domain](/serverless-containers/how-to/add-a-custom-domain-to-a-container/) in Serverless Containers


## Going further

- Refer to the dedicated documentation on [how to add a custom domain to a container](/serverless-containers/how-to/add-a-custom-domain-to-a-container/) for more information.

- If you manage your domain names with Scaleway, refer to the [Scaleway Domains and DNS documentation](/domains-and-dns/).
