## WordPress InstantApp - Overview

This page shows you how to create Wordpress Instances with the Scaleway CLI. Refer to our [tutorial on creating Wordpress Instances from the Scaleway console](/tutorials/wordpress-instantapp/) to create an Instance from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/).

WordPress is a popular, free and open source blogging tool and a content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL.

Working with the WordPress InstantApp significantly saves you time and effort as WordPress is already installed and configured on your Instance.

The new Wordpress image is updated on a regular basis to be as close as possible to the latest release.

## Auto-install functionality

The Wordpress image comes with a new `auto-install` functionality which allows you to create a Wordpress Instance using a few well-defined tags.
Tags allow you to provide the basic information necessary to have a fully working Wordpress Instance.

To trigger the auto-install functionality, two mandatory tags are required for full automation:

- `admin_user_name`
- `admin_email`


Optional tags such as `weblog_title`and `language` can also be used to add more customization to the Weblog.

<Message type="note">
  The value for the `language` tag must adhere to the [list of Wordpress locale codes](https://wpastra.com/docs/complete-list-wordpress-locale-codes).

A random password will be generated and will be accessible when you log into your Instance with your SSH key.

## Creating Wordpress Instances with the Scaleway CLI


### Creating a new Wordpress Instance ready for installation


1. Open a terminal and type the following command to create a new Wordpress Instance ready for installation:
    ```
    scw instance server create type=PLAY2-NANO zone=fr-par-2 image=wordpress root-volume=b:20G name=wordpress-instance ip=new
    ```

    The Instance information, such as the IP address, displays in the output of the comment.

2. Open a web browser and point it to your Instance's IP address to complete the installation of your WordPress blog.
    <Message type="note">
      You have created an Instance and an image called "Wordpress".

### Creating a new Wordpress Instance with minimal configuration


Type the following command into your terminal to create a new Wordpress Instance with the two mandatory tags allowing you to trigger `auto-install`:
```
scw instance server create name=wordpress type=PLAY2-NANO zone=fr-par-2 image=wordpress root-volume=b:20G name=wordpress-instance ip=new tags.0="admin_user_name=myuser" tags.1="admin_email=me@example.com"
```
The following output displays when you log into your Instance:
```
Hi Cloud Rider,
Welcome to the WordPress image!
WordPress is installed in /var/www/wordpress.
Log into WordPress at http://195.154.160.109/wp-login.php with user: myuser and password: {{automatically generated password}}.
MySQL is configured for user root with password {{automatically generated password}}.
Your website configuration lies at:
- /etc/nginx/sites-available/000-default.conf
Enjoy!
```

<Message type="note">
  The Weblog created will be in English, with the title "Weblog" as default value.
</Message>


### Creating a new fully configured Wordpress Instance

Type the following command into your terminal to create a new fully configured Wordpress Instance:
```
scw instance server create type=PLAY2-NANO zone=fr-par-2 image=wordpress root-volume=b:20G name=wordpress-instance ip=new tags.0="weblog_title=My Scaleway Blog" tags.1="admin_user_name=myuser" tags.2="admin_email=me@example.com" tags.3="language=en_EN" tags.4="use_weak=on"
```

The following output displays when you log into your Instance:
```
Hi Cloud Rider,
Welcome to the WordPress image!
WordPress is installed in /var/www/wordpress.
Log into WordPress at http://195.154.160.213/wp-login.php with user: myuser and and password: {{automatically generated password}}.
MySQL is configured for user root with password {{automatically generated password}}.
Your website configuration lies at:
- /etc/nginx/sites-available/000-default.conf
Enjoy!
```

<Message type="note">
  You have created an Instance and an image called "Wordpress", named your Weblog "My Scaleway Blog", added the two mandatory tags which allow you to trigger `auto-install`, selected English as your language, and allowed weak passwords to be added (they are needed on the Web interface).
