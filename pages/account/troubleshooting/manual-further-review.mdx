## Problem
My account is locked, and I can't access my resources.

### Symptoms
You see a warning banner on your Scaleway console stating that your account requires a 'manual review' or 'further review'.

### Solution
If you encounter one of these two messages, it means your account has been temporarily locked and requires manual intervention from our agents.
[Contact our Support team](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create), informing us of the message you received and requesting details about the lock and how to resolve the problem.
