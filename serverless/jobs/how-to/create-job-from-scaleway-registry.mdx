Scaleway's Serverless Jobs allows you to create jobs from several container [registries](/containers/container-registry/concepts/#registry), including the [Scaleway Container Registry](/containers/container-registry/concepts/#container-registry) which allows you to store, secure and manage all your custom container images effortlessly.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created a Container Registry namespace](/containers/container-registry/how-to/create-namespace/) and [pushed a container image](/containers/container-registry/how-to/push-images/) to it
</Message>

1. Click **Jobs** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The jobs page displays.

2. Click **Create job**. The job creation wizard displays.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Select the **Scaleway** Container Registry.
    - Select the required Container Registry Namespace from the drop-down list, and then select the container image and tag.
    - Enter a name or use the automatically generated one. The name can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes.
    - Select the region in which your job will be created.
    - Choose the **resources** to be allocated to your job at runtime. These define the performance characteristics of your job.
    - In the advanced options, define any **environment variables** you want to inject into your job. For each environment variable, click **+Add new variable** and enter the key/value pair.
    - Add a **startup command** to your job. It will be executed everytime your job is run.
    - Set a **maximum duration** to your job to stop it automatically if it does not complete within this limit.
    - Verify the **estimated cost**.
4. Click **Create a job definition** to finish. You are directed to the listing of your Serverless Jobs.

5. Click the name of the job you just created. The **Overview** tab displays.

6. Click **Run job** to execute it.

The execution appears in the **Job runs** section of the **Overview** tab.
