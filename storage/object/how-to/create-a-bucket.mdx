Object Storage allows you to store different types of objects (documents, images, videos, etc.) and distribute them instantly, anywhere in the world.

To get started with Object Storage, you must first create a bucket. Objects are gathered into buckets. Each bucket represents a space where objects are stored.

1. Click **Object Storage** on the left side menu of the console. The Object Storage dashboard displays.
2. Click **+ Create bucket**. The bucket creation page displays.
3. Select the geographical location in which to create your bucket.  Scaleway Object Storage is currently available in three Regions.
    - Amsterdam, The Netherlands:
      - Region: `nl-ams`
    - Paris, France:
      - Region: `fr-par`
    - Warsaw, Poland:
      - Region: `pl-waw`
4. Check **Public** or **Private** to define the bucket visibility. The bucket visibility specifies whether everyone can see the list of objects in the bucket. It does not affect [object visibility](/storage/object/concepts/#visibility).
    <Message type="note">
      A file uploaded to a public bucket is private by default.
      A private file stored in a public bucket is not publicly accessible.
      You can change the bucket visibility at any time from the **Bucket settings** tab.
    </Message>
5. Select a use case for your bucket.
6. Enter a name for your bucket. 
7. Optionally, you can use the cost estimator to simulate your Object Storage costs.
8. Click **Create bucket** to confirm. A list of your buckets displays, showing the newly created bucket.

You can find more information about your bucket by clicking on its name in the **Buckets** list and then on the **Bucket settings** tab.
