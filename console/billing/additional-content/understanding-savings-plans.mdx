Scaleway's Savings Plan is a commitment-based discount program that provides more cost-effective billing compared to the pay-as-you-go model. This plan offers greater flexibility than traditional reservation billing models by merging the benefits of discounted rates with the adaptability of pay-as-you-go billing.

## How do Scaleway Savings Plans work?

When you purchase a Savings Plan, you:

- Commit to a specific amount of resource usage each month, calculated before taxes and discounts. This is the usage amount you will be billed for at the Savings Plan rate.
- Will be charged at the Savings Plan's discounted rate for any usage within your committed amount.

      This means that:
        - If you use less than what you committed to, you will still be billed for the full committed amount.
        - If you use more than the committed amount, the extra usage will be charged at the regular on-demand rate.
    </Message>
- The Savings Plan discount will apply to the committed amount.

      Commitment rates are calculated based on the public prices of resources before taxes and do not include any discounts.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-savings-plan.webp" size="medium" alt="the image contains a graph showing a simulation of how the Savings Plan works for an account. X axis = month and Y axis = commitment amount in Euro. A horizontal line represents the committed amount. The graph displays the consumption of an account over three months. In the first month, the consumption is under the committed amount, so under the line. For the second month, the consumption is exactly the committed amount, so it joins the line. On the third and last month, the consumption went over the committed amount. Therefore, it goes over the line." />

### Eligibility and quotas

Your Organization is eligible to purchase a Savings Plan if:
    - It does not have any ongoing contracts with Scaleway
    - You have verified your identity via the Scaleway console
    - Does not have any outstanding invoices

### Scope

Currently, Scaleway only offers Savings Plans for compute resources.

### Commitment amount

The monthly commitment amount for a Savings Plan must be at least €1000. The amount you specify will determine in which discount bracket your plan falls.

### Duration

The commitment period can last 12, 24, or 36 months. The longer the commitment, the higher the discount offered.

### Payment options

Payments are made on a monthly basis as part of your regular billing cycle.

### Discounts

Savings Plan discounts are applied automatically to the eligible services.

At Scaleway, the discounts are applied in the following order:
    - Free tiers or free trials - Savings Plan discounts will apply after any eligible free tier or trial credits have been used. This ensures that you maximize your free usage before the Savings Plan discount is applied.
    - Savings plans, and
    - Discounts (vouchers or credits) - Any applicable vouchers or credits are used and applied after the Savings Plan discount.

Understanding this order helps you optimize your savings and ensure that you make the most of the available discounts.

### Cancellations and exchanges

Savings plans cannot be canceled or exchanged.

If you need to request a change to your savings plan, [contact the sales team](https://www.scaleway.com/en/contact-sales/).

We do not make refunds for savings plans that have already been invoiced.

<Message type="important">
  If you have early access to the Savings Plans, you can delete your Savings Plan at any time. The deletion of a savings plan will take effect at the end of the month, regardless of the date the deletion request is made.

### Taxes and currency

The total cost displayed for the savings plan includes applicable taxes, and these will be itemized on your monthly invoice.

Currently, we invoice all our customers in euros (EUR). If your primary currency is different, our Payment Service Providers (PSPs) apply the prevailing exchange rate without any additional currency conversion fees on your part.
