## xRDP - Overview

xRDP is an open-source alternative to Microsoft RDP (Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol).

The tool provides a graphical login to remotely access machines and accept connections from various RDP clients: [FreeRDP](http://www.freerdp.com/), [rdesktop](https://www.rdesktop.org/), [NeutrinoRDP](https://github.com/neutrinolabs/NeutrinoRDP) and [Microsoft Remote Desktop Client](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-clients) (for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android).

RDP connections are encrypted by default using TLS for increased security.

In this tutorial you will learn how to install the [xRDP](http://xrdp.org/) server together with [xfce](https://xfce.org/), a lightweight and stable desktop environment ideally suited for the use as a remote desktop.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your SSH key](/console/project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
  - You have an Instance running on Ubuntu Bionic Beaver (18.04)
  - You have sudo privileges or access to the root user

## Installing the desktop environment

1. Connect to your Instance using `ssh`:
    ```
    ssh root@<your_instance_ip>
    ```
2. Update the `apt` sources list and upgrade the software already installed on the instance:
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
  3. Install the required packages for the desktop environment using the `apt` package manager:
    ```
    apt install xorg xfce4 xfce4-goodies dbus-x11 x11-xserver-utils
    ```

## Installing xRDP

1. The xRDP server is available in the default Ubuntu repositories, and it can be installed easily using `apt`. The following command installs the packages `xrdp` and `ufw` a firewall to protect your instance from unauthorized access:
    ```
    apt install xrdp ufw
    ```
2. The package manager configures the service to be automatically started upon system reboot. Run the following command to check that the service has been started during the installation:
    ```
    systemctl status xrdp.service
    ```

    You will see a message like the following, confirming the status `active (running)`:

    ```
    ● xrdp.service - xrdp daemon
      Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/xrdp.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
      Active: active (running) since Mon 2019-12-02 16:06:15 UTC; 9s ago
    ```
3. If the service has not been started automatically, start it with `systemctl`:
    ```
    systemctl start xrdp.service
    ```
4. Open the xrdp configuration file in a text editor of your choice, for example `nano`:
    ```
    nano /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini
    ```
5. Scroll to the bottom of the file and add the following line, then save the file and exit the text editor:
    ```
    exec startxfce4
    ```
6. Restart the xrdp service using `systemctl` to activate the new configuration:
    ```
    systemctl restart xrdp.service
    ```
7. Restrict the access to port `3389` to an IP address or a range of IPs. To allow access from the block `192.168.1.0/24` launch the following command:
    ```
    ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 3389
    ```

    To allow connections from any host run the following command:

    <Message type="important">
      This action leaves your connection vulnerable and represents is a high security risk.
    </Message>

    ```
    ufw allow 3389
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      For more information on how to configure the firewall of your Instance, you can [read our tutorial about the configuration of ufw on Ubuntu](/tutorials/installation-uncomplicated-firewall/).
    </Message>

## Adding a regular user

For security reasons, it is recommended to create a regular user to connect to the remote desktop.

1. Add the user with the `adduser` command:
    ```
    adduser <myuser>
    ```
2. (Optionally) If you want to give superuser rights to the user, install sudo using the `apt` package manager:
    ```
    apt install sudo
    ```
3. (Optionally) Add the user to the sudoers file:
    ```
    adduser <myuser> sudo
    ```

## Connecting using RDP

1. Download and install an RDP client of your choice. We will use the [Microsoft Remote Desktop Client](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-clients) in this tutorial.
2. Start the RDP client and click **Add Desktop** to add a new connection :
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-rdp_01.webp" alt="" />
3. Enter the connection details. You need to enter at least your Instance's IP in the **PC name**. Optionally you can add a **Friendly Name** to facilitate the identification of your Instance in case you configure several RDP connections.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-rdp_02.webp" alt="" />
4. Double-click the connection icon. During the first connection, you may be asked to validate the fingerprint of the Instance. Click **OK** to confirm the connection.
5. Enter the identifier and password of your regular user when prompted.
6. You are now connected and the remote desktop displays. You can launch applications on the remote machine, as you would do locally.
