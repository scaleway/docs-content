Contractual commitments are custom agreements between Scaleway and Scaleway Organizations that define specific terms for usage, discounts, and financial commitments over a defined period.

## How do Scaleway contractual commitments work?

Contractual commitments can define and apply tailored pricing models, including volume-based discounts, product-specific incentives, and minimum spend requirements.

When you sign a contractual commitment, the contract information, such as specific terms, including discounts, duration, and scope, is detailed in the contract you signed. The information is entered into the Scaleway system, ensuring that your contractual discounts are applied automatically and are clearly detailed in your invoices for the next month.


### Eligibility and Quotas

These contracts are not available via self-service. If you have an active contractual commitment with Scaleway, you will see its monthly billing details in your invoice.

You can [reach out to our Sales teams](https://www.scaleway.com/en/contact-sales/) to learn more about contractual commitments.

### Scope

The scope of coverage is fully customizable. The products to which discounts will apply and for how long are defined between your Organization and Scaleway upon contract negotiation.

### Commitment amount and duration

These are highly customizable and can vary by:

- Monthly or cumulative minimum spend.
- Tiered commitments (e.g., increasing discounts at higher thresholds).
- Multiple "steps" or phases within the same contract (e.g., different discounts per quarter).

### Discounts

Contractual commitment discounts are applied automatically to the eligible services.

At Scaleway, contractual commitment discounts are applied according to the following principles.

    - Discounts are applied automatically to eligible services, within the scopes defined in the contract.
    - They can be either percentage-based (rate) or fixed-value (value).
    - If the committed amount is not reached, penalties may apply. Any agreed discounts will also apply to those penalties, but only if the product scope matches.

### Cancellation

Cancellation terms are strictly defined in your signed contract. Keep in mind that:
    - Early contract termination may result in penalties or full payment of the remaining commitment.
    - We advise you to directly contact the Scaleway account manager in charge of your Organization when you have questions about the terms and conditions of your contract.

### Taxes and currency

The net discount is applied before tax calculations, and any penalties are taxed under the same rules. Taxes are displayed on a dedicated section of the invoice, under the summary of your Projects' total consumption.

Currently, we invoice all customers in euros (EUR). If your primary currency is different, our Payment Service Providers (PSPs) apply the prevailing exchange rate.
