Once you have finished your inference tasks you can delete your deployment from the Scaleway console.

<Macro id="requirements" />

  - A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - An [LLM Inference deployment](/ai-data/llm-inference/quickstart/)


1. Click **LLM Inference** in the **AI & Data** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. A list of your deployments displays.
2. Choose a deployment either by clicking its name or selecting **More info** from the drop-down menu represented by the icon <Icon name="more" /> to access the deployment dashboard.
3. Click the **Settings** tab of your deployment to display additional settings.
4. Click **Delete deployment** to delete your deployment.
5. Type **DELETE** to confirm and click **Delete deployment** to delete your deployment.
