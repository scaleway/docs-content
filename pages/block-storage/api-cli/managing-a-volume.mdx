This documentation only explains how to mount **additional block volumes to your Instance**, as the root volume of your Instance is already mounted at creation. The volume where your OS is running cannot be mounted.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Instance](/instances/concepts/#instance)
- [Attached](/block-storage/how-to/attach-a-volume/) an additional Block Storage volume to your Instance

## Mounting and using a Block Storage volume

In order to mount and use your Block Storage volume, you need to connect to the Instance it is attached to, via SSH.
Then, check that the volume is available, format it, and mount it following the instructions below.

### Verifying device availability

1. Connect to your Instance with `ssh`.
    ```
    ssh root@<your_instance_ip>
    ```
2. Use the `lsblk` command to confirm that your block volume is available:
    ```
    lsblk
    ```

   You should see an output similar to the following. The root Block volume `sda`, contains your OS. The Block volume named `sdb` is the one we will be mounting to the Instance.

    ```sh no-copy
    root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# lsblk
    NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
    sda       8:0    0 18.6G  0 disk
    ├─sda1    8:1    0 18.5G  0 part /
    ├─sda14   8:14   0    4M  0 part
    └─sda15   8:15   0  106M  0 part /boot/efi
    sdb       8:16   0 27.9G  0 disk
    ```

  The Scaleway ecosystem uses [GB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte) to define storage sizes and not [GiB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibibyte) as the default on linux.

### Formatting the Block volume

Formatting your volume prepares it for storing files.

<Message type="important">
 The procedure below describes how to format your volume using the `mkfs` command, which will **erase all data on the volume**.
</Message>

1. Create a file system with the following command. This command uses the `ext4` file system, though you can choose another if you prefer.
    ```
    # Make sure that you replace `/dev/sdX` with the name of your volume
    mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX
    ```
2. Run the following command to check if your file system was correctly created.
    ```
    lsblk -f
    ```

  You should see an output like the following. Check that the `FSTYPE` field matches `ext4` for your Block volume. In this example, we have formatted the `sdb` volume.

  ```sh no-copy
    root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# lsblk -f
    NAME FSTYPE FSVER LABEL UUID                                 FSAVAIL FSUSE% MOUNTPOINTS
    sda
    ├─sda1
    │    ext4   1.0   cloudimg-rootfs
    │                       cf5b092b-9a8b-49e9-980c-b44b5e3ed197   14.5G    18% /
    ├─sda14
    │
    └─sda15
        vfat   FAT32 UEFI  D590-3FD4                              98.3M     6% /boot/efi
    sdb  ext4   1.0         d36bdf8b-b2ff-4e2b-9736-cc05940aea35
  ```

### Creating the mount point and mounting the Block volume

Once you have created your file system, you need to define where you want to mount your volume, and create a mount point (directory) for it.

1. Create the mount point. You can replace `block-volume` with another name for your mount point.
    ```
    mkdir /mnt/block-volume
    ```
2. Mount the volume. We recommend that you use the `defaults` option, as in the command below.
    ```
    # Replace sdX with the name of your volume
    mount -o defaults /dev/sdX /mnt/block-volume
    ```

    If you want to see all available options, you can run `man mount` on your Instance.

3. Run the following command to check if your volume was properly mounted:
    ```
    lsblk
    ```

    You should see an output like the following. Check the `MOUNTPOINT` field.

    ```sh no-copy
    root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# lsblk
    NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    sda       8:0    0 18.6G  0 disk
    ├─sda1    8:1    0 18.5G  0 part /
    ├─sda14   8:14   0    4M  0 part
    └─sda15   8:15   0  106M  0 part /boot/efi
    sdb       8:16   0 27.9G  0 disk /mnt/block-volume
    ```

The `sdb` volume is mounted at `/mnt/block-volume`.

---

### Using fstab for Persistent Mounting

With the current configuration, your volume will not be mounted automatically upon reboot. Use the `/etc/fstab` file to ensure the reboot does not impact your file system.

Run the following command to make sure your volume is automatically mounted to your Instance upon reboot. You must replace `sdX` with your volume.

```
echo "UUID=$(blkid --output value /dev/sdX | head -n1) /mnt/block-volume ext4 defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
```

---

### Transferring data from your local machine to the remote Block volume

You can transfer files from your local machine to your Instance's remote Block volume with [rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync), a tool for efficiently transferring and copying files. The rsync utility is pre-installed on most Linux distributions and macOS.

1. Check that rsync is installed on your local machine with the following command:
    ```
    rsync --version
    ```

    An output similar to the following displays:

    ```sh no-copy
    rsync  version 3.1.3  protocol version 31
    Copyright (C) 1996-2018 by Andrew Tridgell, Wayne Davison, and others.

        append, ACLs, xattrs, iconv, symtimes, prealloc

    ```

        <Message type="tip">
          If you get a `command not found` output (or similar), you need to install `rsync`:
          - On Linux Ubuntu and Debian systems, you can do this with the APT package tool using the `sudo apt install rsync` command.
          - For Linux CentOS/ Fedora, you can use the YUM package manager: `sudo yum install rsync`.
          - On Mac OSX with the Homebrew package manager, you can use `brew install rsync`.
        </Message>

2. On your local machine, open a new terminal and use the following command to create a file called `hello-world.txt`:
    ```
    nano hello-world.txt
    ```

3. Enter the text `Hello World!`.

4. Press `Ctrl+O`, then `Enter`, then `Ctrl+X` to save and exit the file.

5. Enter the following command to transfer the file to your Instance's mounted block volume. Ensure that you use your own Instance's IP address:

    ```
    rsync -a hello-world.txt root@<your_instance_ip>:/mnt/block-volume
    ```

The file is now transferred. You can connect to your Instance again, and use the command `cd /mnt/block-volume ; ls` to check that the file appears in the directory.

## Increasing the partition size of the volume with growpart

`growpart` allows you to resize partitions. If you have increased the size of the partition's underlying volume, for example, you can increase the size of the partition to make use of the additional space.

<Message type="important">
  - Make sure to make a backup of your data using the [snapshot](/block-storage/how-to/create-a-snapshot/) feature beforehand to avoid any potential data loss
  - You must have partitioned your volume to follow the procedure below
  - If the partition you want to resize is mounted, you must [unmount it](/block-storage/api-cli/unmounting-a-volume/) beforehand
</Message>

1. Connect to your Instance using [SSH](/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).

2. Use the `lsblk` command to identify your volume partition. Ensure that the partition is **not mounted before you resize it**. In the following example, we are resizing `sdb1`:

    ```
    root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# lsblk
    NAME    MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
    sda       8:0    0  23.3G  0 disk
    ├─sda1    8:1    0  23.2G  0 part /
    ├─sda14   8:14   0     4M  0 part
    └─sda15   8:15   0   106M  0 part /boot/efi
    sdb       8:16   0 38.6G  0 disk
    └─sdb1    8:17   0 18.6G  0 part
    ```

3. Use `growpart` to increase the partition size of your Block Storage volume (here `sdb1`):

    ```
    # Replace /dev/sdX 1 with the name of your partition
    growpart /dev/sdX 1
    ```

    An output similar to the following displays:

    ```
    CHANGED: partition=1 start=0 old: size=39061504 end=39061504 new: size=58490880 end=58490880
    ```

4. Use `lsblk` to check that the partition was correctly resized. In the following output, you can see that our partition `sbd1` went from `18.6G` (step 2) to `27.9G`.
    ```
    root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# lsblk
    NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
    sda       8:0    0 18.6G  0 disk
    ├─sda1    8:1    0 18.5G  0 part /
    ├─sda14   8:14   0    4M  0 part
    └─sda15   8:15   0  106M  0 part /boot/efi
    sdb       8:16   0 27.9G  0 disk
    └─sdb1    8:17   0 27.9G  0 part
