If you are having trouble [connecting to your Instance via SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/), when the Instance is attached to a Private Network which also has an attached Public Gateway, read on for help and solutions.

The action to take depends on whether:

- The Private Network(s) attached to your Instance have [DHCP enabled](/network/vpc/how-to/activate-dhcp/), and 
- Your Public Gateway is set to [advertise a default route](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#default-route) (true by default).

If the above two conditions are not true, there may be other factors impacting your Instance, like one of your Instances running a DHCP server. Try disconnecting and reconnecting the Instance from the Private Network. 

If DHCP **is** activated and your Public Gateway **is** set to advertise a default route, not being able to connect to your Instance via SSH is **expected behavior**. All the traffic towards your Instance now goes through the Public Gateway. 

To access your Instance using SSH in this scenario, the recommended solution is to use [SSH bastion](/network/public-gateways/how-to/use-ssh-bastion/).

<Message type="important">
SSH bastion is the recommended solution. For advanced users only, another manual workaround is to create a static NAT association between a port of your Public Gateway (e.g. `2222`) and the private IP assigned to your Instance, on the SSH port (`22` by default). Then, SSH to the Public Gateway's IP on port `2222`.
