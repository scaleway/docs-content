The newest Ubuntu 24.04 Noble Numbat Instances may become unreachable after a reboot. This distribution now uses dhcpcd which may encounter longer delays to reapply its DHCP lease after a reboot.<br />

Instances created after June 11th 2024 will not encounter this problem.

## Your Instance has not been rebooted

You can avoid this situation by increasing the dhcpcd timeout in its configuration file
```
sed -i 's/timeout 5/timeout 10/' /etc/dhcpcd.conf

tail /etc/dhcpcd.conf
option rapid_commit

# A ServerID is required by RFC2131.
require dhcp_server_identifier

# Generate SLAAC address using the Hardware Address of the interface
#slaac hwaddr
# OR generate Stable Private IPv6 Addresses based from the DUID
slaac private
timeout 10
```

## Your Instance has rebooted and is no longer reachable

[Rescue mode](/compute/instances/concepts/#rescue-mode) allows you to boot your Instance into a temporary operating system, running from the Instance's RAM. Rescue mode is often used to diagnose and resolve issues such as faulty kernel configurations, networking issues, firewall configurations, and more.

1. Switch the Instance's `boot-type` to `rescue` and reboot your Instance into rescue mode using the [CLI](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/developer-tools/scaleway-cli/quickstart/):
    ```
    scw instance server stop <Instance_ID>
    scw instance server update <Instance_ID> boot-type=rescue
    scw instance server start <Instance_ID>
    ```
    <Message type="note">
        Replace `<Instance_ID>` with the unique ID of your Instance, e.g. `0500ebd2-d70d-49af-a969-3ac09b6f7fff`.
    </Message>
2. Once the Instance is rebooted, log into your Instance using [SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/) and set up the environment to be able to chroot into it:
    ```sh
    cat /proc/partitions
    major minor #blocks name

    8 0 9765625 sda
    8 1 9634536 sda1
    8 14 3072 sda14
    8 15 126976 sda15
    ```
    Then mount the partitions:
    ```
    mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
    ```
3. Once mounted, use the `chroot` command to get into your Instance's root filesystem. You can then change the timeout value for dhcpcd as shown above :
    ```
    chroot /mnt
    sed -i 's/timeout 5/timeout 10/' /etc/dhcpcd.conf

    tail /etc/dhcpcd.conf
    option rapid_commit

    # A ServerID is required by RFC2131.
    require dhcp_server_identifier

    # Generate SLAAC address using the Hardware Address of the interface
    #slaac hwaddr
    # OR generate Stable Private IPv6 Addresses based from the DUID
    slaac private
    timeout 10

    exit
    umount /mnt
    ```
4. Switch back the Instance's `boot_type` to `local` and reboot the Instance:
    ```
    scw instance server stop <Instance_ID>
    scw instance server update <Instance_ID> boot-type=local
    scw instance server start <Instance_ID>
    ```
    Once rebooted, your Instance will be reachable again.
