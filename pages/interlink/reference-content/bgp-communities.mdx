You can use **B**order **G**ateway **P**rotocol (BGP) communities on outgoing routes (advertized by Scaleway VPC) and incoming routes (advertized by your external router). TODO CHECK? 

A BGP community is a group of IP prefixes that share a common attribute.

Scaleway makes available three tags for the **Local Preference** attribute. This attribute lets you influence load balancing and route preference for traffic. For each prefix that you advertize over a BGP session, you can apply one of the following local preference community tags to indicate the priority of the associated path for returning traffic:

- `12876:42050` — Low preference
- `12876:42100` — Medium preference
- `12876:42200` — High preference

Local preference BGP community tags are evaluated in order from lowest to highest preference, where the highest preference is preferred.

These tags are mutually exclusive, meaning you can only apply one of them per prefix.

To apply these community tags, you must configure your BGP router or software to add the appropriate community to the routes you advertise.
