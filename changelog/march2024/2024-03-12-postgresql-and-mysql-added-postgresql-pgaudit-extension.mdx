The pgAudit extension allows to produce audit logs required to pass certain government, financial, or ISO certification audits.

A setup tutorial will be available soon in your Scaleway console. In the meantime, you can refer to the [pgAudit documentation](https://github.com/pgaudit/pgaudit/blob/master/README.md).
