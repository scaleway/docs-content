Failover IP addresses allow you to have several IPs on the same server. You could then, for example, have one IP for each website or virtual machine hosted on the server.
Each failover IP can be routed to any of your Dedibox servers at any time in just a few minutes by using the Scaleway console or the API. By switching your failover IP addresses from one server to another, the hosted services remain available without reconfiguring the IP address.

Failover IPs can be bought as single IP addresses with a maximum number of IPs per Dedibox server, depending on your offer, or as /27 IP blocks for Dedibox servers with a Business service level.
