Llama 3.1 70B is now deprecated. The new Llama 3.3 70B is available with similar or better performance in most use cases.
Llama 3.1 70B will remain available through the API until May 25th 2025. You will then be redirected automatically to the Llama 3.3 70B API afterwards. Llama 3.1 8B is not affected by this change and remains supported.
