Scaleway’s Secret Manager is a service that allows you to store and manage sensitive information, such as API keys, usernames, passwords, and security certificates in a secure and centralized location.

Secret Manager helps you manage the lifecycle of sensitive information:

Secrets are encrypted and stored in a central and secure way, while data access is secured by an authenticated API call to avoid hard-coded transmission and protect your Organization against security breaches.
