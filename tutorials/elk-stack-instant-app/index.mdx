This page shows you how to use the [ELK stack InstantApp](https://www.scaleway.com/en/imagehub/) on your Scaleway instance.
ELK stack is an environment that lets you collect and visualize your logs with:

- Elasticsearch for search and data analytics
- Logstash for centralized logging, log enrichment and parsing
- Kibana to visualize data

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have [configured your SSH Key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key)

## Create and start a new instance using the ELK stack InstantApp

Follow the instructions for [creating an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance). When selecting the **image** to run on the Instance, ensure that you choose the **ELK stack** image in the **InstantApps** tab.

The server will be created with a ready to use install of elasticsearch, Kibana and logstash.

## Collect Syslogs data with Logstash

In this tutorial we will see how to track syslogs data and visualize them from Kibana.

Let's start by creating a new configuration file to collect system logs. Open a new file in `/etc/logstash/conf.d/logstash-syslog.conf` and fill it with the following:

```
input {
file {
path => [ "/var/log/*.log", "/var/log/messages", "/var/log/syslog" ]
type => "syslog"
}
}

output {
elasticsearch { host => localhost }
stdout { codec => rubydebug }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The configuration above tells Logstash to collect all files with `.log` extention in `/var/log`, `/var/log/messages` and `/var/log/syslog`.

Next, we will create a filter to prevent Elasticsearch to store logs in the `message` field and simplify the analysis.

{% highlight sh %}
filter {
if [type] == "syslog" {
grok {
match => { "message" => "%{SYSLOGTIMESTAMP:syslog_timestamp} %{SYSLOGHOST:syslog_hostname} %{DATA:syslog_program}(?:\[%{POSINT:syslog_pid}\])?: %{GREEDYDATA:syslog_message}" }
add_field => [ "received_at", "%{@timestamp}" ]
add_field => [ "received_from", "%{host}" ]
}
syslog_pri { }
date {
match => [ "syslog_timestamp", "MMM d HH:mm:ss", "MMM dd HH:mm:ss" ]
}
}
}
```

Restart logstash to apply our changes `service logstash restart`

## Visualize your data with Kibana

System logs are now collected and stored in elasticsearch, you can visualize them with Kibana. Open a browser and go to `http://<your_server_public_ip>`.
You are asked for a login and password. You can retrieve them on the message of the day (MOTD) when you connect your server.

  To access Kibana, open http://xxx.yyy.zzz.www/.
  Login with user kibana and password -> ieshahchuemohfohxooshieshieshiojiepiengeng <-
  You can hide this message on the next connection by deleting the /etc/update-motd.d/70-elk file.
  ```

You land on Kibana homepage and are asked to configure an index pattern. Index patterns are used to identify the Elasticsearch index to run search and analytics against.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-kibana01.png" alt="" />

To create the first index, select `@timestamp` from the Time-field-name menu and click the Create button.

On the top navigation bar, click the Discover tab.

Here will be displayed all the log collected and an histogram representing the log activity.

It is your turn now! Start playing with Kibana, create graphics and filters on your logs :)

## Conclusion

ELK stack lets you search and analyze your data with ease. From here you can go deeper and create a more complex configuration.
For instance you can use `logstash-forwarder` which let you collect logs from remote servers and send them to Logstash.
