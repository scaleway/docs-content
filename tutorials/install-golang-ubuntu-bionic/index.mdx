[Go](https://golang.org) is an open-source programming language, initially developed by a team at Google and becoming increasingly popular for many applications. The project is backed by many contributors from the open-source community.

This tutorial will guide you through the download and installation of the Go programming language on a Ubuntu Bionic Beaver server. At the end of this guide, you will create your first Go application.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your SSH Key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
  - You have a server running on Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver)
  - You have sudo privileges or access to the root user.

## Installing Go

1. Connect to your server using [SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).

  ```
  ssh root@your_server_ip
  ```

2. Update your apt packet cache and upgrade the software already installed on the server to the latest release.

  ```
  apt update && apt upgrade -y
  ```

3. Install the Go programming language from the apt repository:

  ```
  apt install golang -y
  ```

4. Make sure Go is installed by running the following command:

  ```
  go version
  ```

  You should see an output like the following:

  ```
  root@gopher:~# go version
  go version go1.10.1 linux/amd64
  ```

5. Set the `GOPATH` for your environment:

  ```bash
  echo "GOPATH=$HOME/golang" >> ~/.bashrc
  echo "export GOPATH" >> ~/.bashrc
  echo "PATH=\$PATH:\$GOPATH/bin # Add GOPATH/bin to PATH for scripting" >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc
  ```

## Creating a Hello World Go Application

1. Start by creating a workspace, where you will store the files of your project.

  ```
  mkdir -p $HOME/golang/src/hello-world
  ```
  <Message type="note">

    Go uses a strict [Workspace layout]. You should follow the guidelines to make sure your application will work.

2. Open a text editor and create a file `hello-world.go` in the working directory. Then copy and paste the following content into it:

  ```golang
  package main

  import "fmt"

  func main() {
      fmt.Printf("Hello world! This is my first Go program.\n")
  }
  ```

3. Run the code directly in Go with the command `go run`:

  ```
  go run hello-world.go
  ```

4. Compile the application if you want to have a program directly available as a binary to distribute it. 

  ```
  go install hello-world
  ```

5. Once the application is compiled, you can launch it by typing `hello-world` in your terminal.

  ```bash
  bill@golang:~# hello-world
  Hello world! This is my first Go program.
  ```

6. Use `which` to discover the location of the binary. It will return the file path:

  ```
  bash
  bill@golang:~# which hello-world
  /home/bill/golang/bin/hello-world
  ```

## Creating a Go Web Application

Go provides the [`net/http`](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/) package, which makes it very easy to create web applications:

Create a new workspace and add the following content to the **main.go**.

```
go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", WorldServer)
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}

func WorldServer(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, %s!", r.URL.Path[1:])
}
```

You now have a working Go development environment. If you want to learn more about writing code in Go, you can follow the [interactive tutorial](https://tour.golang.org/).
