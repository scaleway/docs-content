<Macro id="requirements" />
* A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
* A [Dedibox dedicated server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/) with a [DELL PERC H700/H710/H730/H730P](https://i.dell.com/sites/csdocuments/Shared-Content_data-Sheets_Documents/en/perc-technical-guidebook.pdf) RAID controller

## Checking the SMART status of a disk
To check the SMART status of a disk connected to a DELL PERC H700/H710/H730/H730P RAID controller, you can use the `smartctl` tool. 

1. Install the required packages:
  ```sh
  apt-get update && apt-get -y install megaclisas-status megacli && megaclisas-status
  ```
2. Run the following command to check the SMART status of all disks:
  ```sh
  DEVICE=/dev/sda
  for i in $(megacli -pdlist -a0 | grep Id | cut -d":" -f2); do
      echo "============================== $i =============================="
      smartctl -s on -a -d megaraid,${i} ${DEVICE} -T permissive
  done
  ```
3. *(Optional)* To get more information about a specific disk, you can use the following command:
  ```sh
  smartctl -d megaraid,0 -i /dev/sda
  smartctl -d megaraid,1 -i /dev/sda
  ```

## Removing a logical volume and taking a disk out of a RAID configuration

To remove a logical volume and take a disk out of a RAID configuration, you can use the following commands:
```sh
megaclisas-status
megacli -PdList -a0
megacli -LdPdInfo -a0
megacli -AdpSetProp -EnableJBOD -0 -a0
megacli -CfgLdDel -Lall -Force -a0
megacli -CfgForeign -Clear -a0
```

After running these commands, you can verify that the disk is no longer part of the RAID configuration using:

```sh
megaclisas-status
```

## Checking a SMART from a disk outside of a RAID volume

To check the SMART status of a disk that is not part of a RAID volume, you can use the same commands as before:
```sh
megaclisas-status
```
This will show you the status of all disks, including those that are not part of a RAID volume.

## Creating a RAID volume

To create a RAID volume, you can use the following commands:

- To create a RAID 0 volume with a single disk:
  ```sh
  megacli -CfgLdAdd -r0 [32:1] -a0
  ```
- To create a RAID 1 volume with two disks:
  ```sh
  megacli -CfgLdAdd -r1 [32:0,32:1] -a0
  ```
- After creating the RAID volume, you can verify the configuration using:
  ```sh
  megaclisas-status
  ```

## Adding a disk as a hot spare

To add a disk as a hot spare, you can use the following command:
```sh
megacli -PDHSP -Set -PhysDrv [32:X] -aY
```
<Message type="note">
  Replace `X` with the slot number of the disk you want to add as a hot spare, and `Y` with the ID of the RAID volume.

## Putting a Disk online/offline

To put a disk online or offline, you can use the following commands:
```sh
megacli -PDOnline -PhysDrv [32:X] -a0
megacli -PDOffline -PhysDrv [32:X] -a0
```
<Message type="note">
Replace `X` with the slot number of the disk you want to put online or offline.
</Message>

## Removing a Disk from an ongoing RAID configuration

To remove a disk from an ongoing RAID configuration, you can use the following commands:
```sh
megacli -PDOffline -PhysDrv [32:X] -a0
MegaCli -PDMarkMissing -PhysDrv [32:X] -a0
```
<Message type="note">
Replace `X` with the slot number of the disk you want to remove.
</Message>

## Checking RAID rebuilding progress

To check the progress of a RAID rebuild, you can use the following command:
```sh
megacli -pdrbld -showprog -physdrv[32:1] -a0
```
<Message type="tip">
  A version with a progress bar is also available:
  ```sh
  megacli -pdrbld -progdsply -physdrv[32:1] -a0
  ```
</Message>

## Lighting on/off the indicator light on a disk

To light on or off the indicator light on a disk, you can use the following commands:
```sh
MegaCli64 -PdLocate start -physdrv[32:1] -a0
MegaCli64 -PdLocate stop -physdrv[32:1] -a0
```
