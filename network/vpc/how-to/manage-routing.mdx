Routing is used to manage and control the flow of traffic within a VPC. It tells the VPC where to send traffic trying to get to a specific destination IP address. Notably, it allows traffic to be automatically routed between resources attached to different Private Networks within the VPC, using their [private IP addresses](/network/vpc/how-to/attach-resources-to-pn/#how-to-view-the-resource's-ip-address).

Currently, only auto-created routes are available, which are fully managed by Scaleway. Two types of managed route exist:
- **Local subnet route**: Generated when you create a Private Network in a VPC. Allows traffic to be routed between different Private Networks in the VPC.
- **Default route to internet**: Generated when you attach a Public Gateway to a Private Network in the VPC, and set it to advertise a [default route](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#default-route). Allows traffic to be routed to addresses outside the VPC (i.e. the public internet) via the gateway. 

<Message type="note">
Public Gateways remain scoped to the Private Network to which they are attached. They do not advertise the default route on other Private Networks in the VPC. For example, an Instance attached to Private Network A will not be able to access the internet via a Public Gateway in Private Network B.

## How to activate routing on a new VPC

Routing is now activated as standard whenever you [create a new VPC](/network/vpc/how-to/create-vpc/#how-to-create-a-vpc).

## How to activate routing on an existing VPC

1. Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the side menu. The list of your VPCs displays.

    The **Routing** column allows you to see whether routing is already activated for a given VPC.

2. Click **Activate** next to the VPC on which you want to activate routing.

    A message displays warning you that this enables the automatic routing of traffic between the Private Networks of your VPC, and that this action is irreversible.

3. Type **ACTIVATE** in the box, and click **Activate Routing** to confirm.

    Routing is activated on the VPC.

## How to access and read the route table

Your VPC's **route table** can be found in its **Routing** tab. The route table shows all the existing routes for the VPC.

1. Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the side menu. The list of your VPCs displays.

2. Click the VPC on which you have activated routing.

3. Click the **Routing** tab.

    If you have not yet created any Private Networks in the VPC, the route table will be empty. Routes are automatically generated and added to the route table when you either:
    
    - Create a Private Network in the VPC (this generates a **local subnet route**, which allows the VPC to automatically route traffic between Private Networks), or 
    - Attach a Public Gateway to a Private Network and set it to advertise a default route. This generates a **default route to the internet**.
    
    When your route table starts to populate, it will look something like this:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-route-table.webp" alt="" />

    For help with understanding the route table and how to read it, [refer to our documentation about route tables](/network/vpc/reference-content/understanding-routing/#route-table). Note that it is not currently possible to create your own custom routes, but this feature will be coming soon.

    As all routes are currently managed by Scaleway, you do not need to take any action with your route table. If and when you delete Private Networks from the VPC, or delete a Public Gateway advertising the default route, these routes will be automatically deleted from your route table.

### How to view VPC routes in IPV6 

Scaleway VPC routing supports both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. Managed routes to Private Networks are simultaneously generated for both IPV4 and IPV6, and both are added to the route table. Use the toggle above the route table to switch from the default view of **IPV4** routes, to a view of **IPV6** routes.
