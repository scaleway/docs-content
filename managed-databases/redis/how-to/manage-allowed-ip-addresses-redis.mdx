Allowed IPs restrict the IPs allowed to access your Database Instance. The entry `0.0.0.0/0` enables any host to establish a connection.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [Redis™ Database Instance](/managed-databases/redis/how-to/create-a-database-for-redis)

<Message type="note">
  Allowed IP configuration is only available for public networks.
</Message>

## How to add an IP address

1. Click **Redis™** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Click **Allowed IPs** tab.
4. Click **Add IP**. The IP can be a single IP or an IP block.
    <Message type="note">
      The IP must be specified in CIDR format, i.e. `198.51.100.135/32` for a single IP or `198.51.100.0/24` for an IP block.
    </Message>
5. Enter a single IP address or a subnetwork.
    <Message type="note">
      To restore initial settings and allow connections from all IPs, add the following IP block to the list: `0.0.0.0/0`. <br /><br />
      When no IP is specified, your cluster cannot be reached by any host.<br /><br />
      By default, the Scaleway console allows any host to connect to your Database Instance.
