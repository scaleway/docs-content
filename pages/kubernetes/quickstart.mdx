Scaleway Kubernetes [Kapsule](/kubernetes/concepts/#kubernetes-kapsule) and [Kosmos](/kubernetes/concepts/#kubernetes-kosmos) provide a managed environment to create, configure, and run a cluster of preconfigured machines for containerized applications. This allows you to create Kubernetes clusters without the complexity of managing the infrastructure. You can create a Kapsule cluster to your required specifications, edit it after creation, and delete it all when you no longer need it. You might also want to check out our how-to on [deploying an image on your cluster](/kubernetes/how-to/deploy-image-from-container-registry/).

## Console overview
Discover the Kubernetes interface on the Scaleway console.
<GuideFlow src="https://app.guideflow.com/embed/vkmgzdma2k"/>

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to create a Kubernetes cluster

### Cluster configuration

<Message type="note">
  This guide covers the creation of a **Kubernetes Kapsule** cluster. For Kubernetes Kosmos clusters, refer to the [Kubernetes Kosmos documentation](/kubernetes/how-to/create-kosmos-cluster/).
</Message>

1. Navigate to **Kubernetes** under the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The Kubernetes dashboard displays.
2. From the drop-down menu, select the geographical region where you want to create your cluster.
3. Click **Create cluster** to launch the cluster creation wizard.
4. On the cluster configuration page, provide the following details:
    * Check the Organization and Project for the new cluster.
        <Message type="important">
          You cannot move a cluster from one Organization or Project to another once created.
        </Message>
    * Select **Kubernetes Kapsule** as the cluster type, which uses exclusively Scaleway Instances.
      <Message type="note">
        This guide covers the creation of a **Kubernetes Kapsule** cluster. For Kubernetes Kosmos clusters, refer to the [Kubernetes Kosmos documentation](/kubernetes/how-to/create-kosmos-cluster/).
      </Message>
    * Confirm the geographical **region** for the cluster.
    * Select the control plane offer for your cluster. Options include shared or dedicated control planes.
        <Message type="tip">
          Need help deciding on a control plane offer? Learn more about our [Kubernetes control plane offers](/kubernetes/reference-content/kubernetes-control-plane-offers/).
        </Message>
    * Specify the **Kubernetes version** for your cluster.
5. Enter the **cluster's details**. Provide a name for the cluster. Optionally, you can add a description and tags for better organization.
6. Configure the **Private Network** for the cluster to ensure secure and isolated network communication. Each cluster is auto-configured with a /22 IP subnet. Click **Select Private Network** to:
    * Attach an existing Private Network (VPC) within the same Availability Zone from the drop-down menu.
    * Attach a new Private Network to the cluster.
    <Message type="important">
      The Private Network cannot be detached, and the cluster cannot be moved to another Private Network post-creation.
    </Message>
7. Click **Configure pools** to proceed.

### Pool configuration

This section outlines the settings for your cluster pools. You can configure as many pools for your cluster as you require.

1. Configure the following for each pool:
    * Choose an **Availability Zone** for the pool's nodes.
    * Select the **node type** for the pool.
        <Message type="tip">
          Need advice on choosing a node type? [Learn more about Kubernetes nodes.](/kubernetes/concepts/#node)
        </Message>
    * Configure the **system volume**. This volume contains the operating system of the nodes in your pool.
    * Configure **pool options**, including node count and whether to enable autoscaling. Options also include enabling autoheal and linking to a placement group, or you can retain default settings.
        <Message type="tip">
          - Unsure about the autoheal feature? [Learn more about autoheal.](/kubernetes/concepts/#autoheal)
          - Need more information about placement groups? [Learn more about placement groups.](/instances/concepts/#placement-groups)
        </Message>
    * Enable full isolation, if required.
        <Message type="tip">
          Need more information on full isolation? [Learn more about full isolation.](/kubernetes/reference-content/secure-cluster-with-private-network/#what-is-the-difference-between-controlled-isolation-and-full-isolation)
        </Message>
2. Click **Add pool** to integrate the pool into the cluster.
3. To add more pools, click **Expand** and repeat the steps above.
    <Message type="tip">
      You can add or remove pools as needed before finalizing your cluster configuration. To remove a pool, click **Remove** within the respective pool.
    </Message>
4. Once all pools are configured, click **Review** to finalize your cluster setup.

### Review configuration

1. Review the configuration details of your Kubernetes cluster and its pools.
    <Message type="tip">
      To modify any element, click the <Icon name="edit" /> **Edit** icon next to the respective configuration component.
    </Message>
2. Click **Create cluster** to deploy your cluster. Once deployment is complete, the cluster appears in the clusters list.
    You can now download the `kubeconfig` file for your cluster and learn [how to connect to a Kubernetes Kapsule cluster with kubectl](/kubernetes/how-to/connect-cluster-kubectl/).
