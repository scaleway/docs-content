The status of any ongoing DNS operations is visible through a blue dot on the left side of the domain.
Once the record has been validated, the dot turns green, and you will receive an email with further instructions on how to update your domain's DNS servers.

Update the name server information at your current registrar once your domain name is validated, in order to link your existing domain name with your Scaleway Domains DNS zone.
<Message type="note">
  Scaleway's DNS servers are:
  * ns0.dom.scw.cloud
  * ns1.dom.scw.cloud
</Message>

You can verify whether the association of your domain has been completed by checking the **Name servers** section, in the **Domain information** page.

<Message type="important">
  If the entire process is not completed after 14 days, the domains are deleted from the DNS and you will have to start over. Emails reminding you to complete the process are sent on days 7 and 13.
