Reverse DNS, or rDNS, is exactly the opposite of classic forward DNS as we know it. Forward DNS maps a hostname to an IP address. Reverse DNS means we are mapping the IP address to a hostname. This can be very useful, especially if you want to send emails from your Elastic Metal server.

When configuring the reverse DNS for a flexible IPv6, the configuration applies to the first IP (`XXXX:0`) of the /64 IP block.

 Make sure that a corresponding `A-Record` (IPv4) or `AAAA-Record` (IPv6) is pointing to the IP address exists before editing the reverse DNS of an IP address.
