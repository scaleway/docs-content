## Model overview

| Attribute       | Details                            |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| Provider        | [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/technology/#models)                         |
| Model Name      | `mistral-7b-instruct-v0.3`       |
| Compatible Instances | L4 (BF16)                 |
| Context size | 32K tokens    |

## Model name

```bash
mistral-7b-instruct-v0.3:bf16
```

## Compatible Instance

- [L4 (BF16)](https://www.scaleway.com/en/l4-gpu-instance/)

## Model introduction

The first dense model released by Mistral AI, perfect for experimentation, customization, and quick iteration. At the time of the release, it matched the capabilities of models up to 30B parameters.
This model is open weight and distributed under the Apache 2.0 license.

## Why is it useful?

Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 is the smallest and latest Large Language Model (LLM) from Mistral AI, providing a 32k context window and support of function calling.
It does not have any moderation mechanisms to finely respect guardrails. Use with caution for deployments in environments requiring moderated outputs.

## How to use it

### Sending Inference requests

To perform inference tasks with your Mistral model deployed at Scaleway, use the following command:

```bash
curl -s \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <IAM API key>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--request POST \
--url "https://<Deployment UUID>.ifr.fr-par.scw.cloud/v1/chat/completions" \
--data '{"model":"mistral-7b-instruct-v0.3", "messages":[{"role": "user","content": "Explain Public Cloud in a nutshell."}], "top_p": 1, "temperature": 0.7, "stream": false}'
```

Make sure to replace `<IAM API key>` and `<Deployment UUID>` with your actual [IAM API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) and the Deployment UUID you are targeting.

<Message type="note">
  Ensure that the `messages` array is properly formatted with roles (system, user, assistant) and content.
</Message>

### Receiving Managed Inference responses

Upon sending the HTTP request to the public or private endpoints exposed by the server, you will receive inference responses from the managed Managed Inference server. 
Process the output data according to your application's needs. The response will contain the output generated by the LLM model based on the input provided in the request.
