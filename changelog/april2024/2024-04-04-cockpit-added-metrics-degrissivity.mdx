Check out our latest update: volume discounts for your external metrics, allowing you to enjoy a cost-efficient monitoring solution!

**How it works:**
The monthly pricing for external metrics will be calculated in levels. **Scaleway applies six levels of volume discounts.**

| Levels       | Range                                    | Monthly pricing with volume discounts    |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Level one    | From 0 to 10 billion external metrics    | €0.15 per million samples                |
| Level two    | From 10 to 25 billion external metrics   | €0.13 per million samples                |
| Level three  | From 25 to 50 billion external metrics   | €0.12 per million samples                |
| Level four   | From 50 to 100 billion external metrics  | €0.11 per million samples                |
| Level five   | From 100 to 200 billion external metrics | €0.10 per million samples                |
| Level six    | From 200 billion external metrics and beyond              | €0.08 per million samples                |


Here is an example of how you would be billed for **sending 52 billion external metrics samples per month**:

- 10 billion samples at €0.15 per million samples: €1.500
- 15 billion samples at €0.13 per million samples: €1.950
- 25 billion samples at €0.12 per million samples: €3.000
- 2 billion samples at €0.11 per million samples: €220

**Total:** €6.650 per month with volume discounts instead of €7.800 without volume discounts.
