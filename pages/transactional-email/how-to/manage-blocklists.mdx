The Transactional Email (TEM) blocklist feature allows you to manage email addresses that generate errors, or [bounces](/transactional-email/concepts/#hard-bounce). Emails are automatically blocked when a mailbox does not exist, or is full, to prevent sending emails to a recipient address that is not reachable. You can also add emails to the blocklist manually if you subscribe to the [TEM Scale plan](/transactional-email/concepts/#scale-plan) and have a Scaleway domain.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization. For blocklists your can apply the `TransactionalEmailBlocklistFullAccess` permission
- [Configured your domain(s) with Transactional Email](/transactional-email/how-to/configure-domain-with-transactional-email/)

## How to add an email address to the blocklist

You can manually add addresses to your blocklist in the Scaleway console. Once added, the email remains blocked indefinitely until you [unblock it](# how-to-unblock-an-email-address) manually.

<Message type="important">
  Manually adding an email address to a domain's blocklist is only available for users who have a Scaleway domain and subscribe to the [TEM Scale plan](/transactional-email/concepts/#scale-plan) for that domain's Project.

1. Click **Transactional Emails** in the **Domains & Web Hosting** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. Your domains display.
2. Click the domain for which you want to manage the blocklist.
3. Click the **Blocklist** tab.
4. Click **+ Add to blocklist**. A pop-up appears.
5. Enter the recipient emails you wish to prevent from receiving emails from your domain.
    <Message type="important">
      You can separate each email address by a comma to add multiple emails at once.
    </Message>
6. (Optional) Provide a reason for blocking the address.
7. Select a flag between:
    - `Mailbox full` - when the mailbox is full
    - `Mailbox not found` - when mailbox does not exist
8. Click **Add to blocklist**. The email is added to your blocklist.

## How to monitor temporary blocklists

If any of your emails bounced, you will see a temporary blocklist entry containing the details of the email that bounced and the reason, or flag. Some examples of bounce reasons are:

  - `Mailbox full` - when the mailbox is full
  - `Mailbox not found` - when mailbox does not exist

The temporary blocklist entry is created automatically to prevent repeated attempts to send emails, which could damage your reputation.

<Message type="important">
  The duration of a temporary blocklist depends on whether or not the an automatic blocklist has already been created for the recipient email. If it is the first blocklist automatically created for the email, the blocklist duration is of 1 week. If a blocklist was already automatically created for the email once, blocklist duration is of 1 month and if three or more time, the duration is unlimited.

To see the blocklist:

1. Click **Transactional Emails** in the **Domains & Web Hosting** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. Your domains display.
2. Click the domain whose blocklist you want to manage.
3. Click the **Blocklist** tab. Your blocklist displays, detailing the recipient email, the flags, the date the block began, and when it ends.

<Message type="tip">
  You can [create webhooks](/transactional-email/how-to/create-webhooks) for the following blocklist events:
    - `email_blocklisted` - An email was blocked by an active blocklist.
    - `blocklist_created` - A blocklist was created for an email address. Any new emails sent by the address will be blocked.

  By setting up a blocklist webhook, you can track changes to your blocklist in real time.

## How to unblock an email address

You can unblock any address that was added to the blocklist. This is useful in cases where:

- A temporary error has been corrected. The recipient has freed up space in their mailbox, for example.
- An address becomes valid again after an update.

<Message type="note">
  You can unblock up to five addresses every 24 hours.
</Message>

1. Click **Transactional Emails** in the **Domains & Web Hosting** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. Your domains display.
2. Click the domain whose blocklist you want to manage.
3. Click the **Blocklist** tab. Your blocklist displays.
4. Click **Unblock** next to the email address you wish to unblock. A warning pop-up appears.

    <Message type="important">
      Make sure the issue causing the email's rejection is resolved before unblocking it to protect your reputation score and ensure optimal email deliverability.
    </Message>
5. Type **UNBLOCK** and click **Unblock** if you wish to continue.
    The email address is removed from your blocklist.
