Your Dedibox server includes a remote reboot system, which we show you how to use in this document.

3. Click the **Reboot** button on the right. A pop-up asks if you are sure you want to reboot.

4. Click **I accept** to confirm the reboot.

  You are returned to your main server page, where you see the message **Reboot in progress**.

  You can also launch a reboot of your server via [KVM](/dedibox/kvm-over-ip/). In the iDRAC and iLO KVM interfaces you can switch your server OFF and ON again. This also enables you to check what is happening during its boot sequence, and intervene if necessary.

  You can also try [rebooting your server in Rescue Mode](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/use-rescue-mode/) if it has stopped responding. If the problem persists, open a support ticket to ask for a hardware check of your server.
