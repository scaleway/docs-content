## VMware vSphere - Overview

VMware vSphere is a complete virtualization solution built around two main components:

- The hypervisor VMware vSphere ESXi, which provides virtual machines for x64-based hardware and their operating systems. Unlike other virtualization solutions ESXi is not a software application running on a traditional operating system, instead it provides vital OS components, such as a kernel.

- VMware vCenter, which manage clusters and provide the graphical management of the entire structure of data center, cluster, network, datastore, CPUs and virtual machines in the form of a dynamic and seamless operating environment.

In this tutorial you will learn how to deploy a complete VMware vSphere Cluster running on two Dedibox [CORE-4-L SSD](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/core/core-4-l-ssd/) servers with additional storage by using the [RPN-SAN](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/storage/rpn-san/) feature.

This tutorial consists of the following steps:

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net)
- You have two Dedibox [CORE-4-L SSD](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/core/core-4-l-ssd/) servers
- You have a [RPN-SAN](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/storage/rpn-san/)

## Installing VMware ESXi via KVM-over-IP

In this tutorial we are using VMware vSphere Hypervisor (ESXi) 6.7U3b. This version is currently not available for automatic installation from the Dedibox Console, therefore we use the manual installation via the KVM-over-IP device of our Dedibox servers. 

<Message type="tip">

[Download](https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/downloads/info/slug/datacenter_cloud_infrastructure/vmware_vsphere/6_7) the vSphere ESXi ISO image on your local computer before continuing with this tutorial.

</Message>

1. Access the server page of your Dedibox in the console and click **Install** to launch the installation via the KVM-over-IP device.

2. Click KVM over IP:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-kvm-over-ip.png" width="600" alt="" />

3. A disclaimer window pops up. Make sure you have read and agreed to the terms displayed and click **I ACCEPT**. You will be redirected to your server’s status page. 

4. Click the **IDRAC** button on the right:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-idrac.png" width="600" alt="" />

5. Enter the IP address of your internet connection in the form and confirm to generate your IDRAC credentials.

6. Log into IDRAC using the provided credentials and launch the virtual console:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-idrac_console.png" width="600" alt="" />

7. Click **Connect Virtual Media** in the menu on the top of the virtual console window. A pop-up displays.

8. Click **Choose file** (1) and select the downloaded VMware ESXi ISO file. Then click **Map device** (2) to connect the virtual CD-ROM drive to the server. Once done close the pop-up.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-map_device.png" width="500" alt="" />

9. Reboot your machine from the Dedibox console.

10. Press **F11** on your keyboard, during the boot process, to enter the boot manager:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-boot_manager.png" width="400" alt="" />

11. Click **One-shot BIOS Menu** in the boot manager:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-one_shoot_boot.png" width="500" alt="" />

12. Select the **Virtual Optical Drive** to boot the machine from the connected ISO file:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-virtual_drive.png" width="500" alt="" />

The server is booting from the ISO file. Depending on your Internet connection, this may take a while. Once ready, the ESXi installer displays. 

14. Follow the prompts to complete the installation of VMWare ESXi on the machine:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-esxi_installer.png" width="500" alt="" />

Repeat the steps above on the second Dedibox server, once the installation of ESXi is completed on the first server.

## Configuring the RPN interface

Configure the RPN interface on both servers once the installation of both machines is completed. To do so, the first step is to activate the SSH service from the ESXi web interface.

1. Connect to the first Dedibox server by typing the server's IP address in a web browser. The ESXi login displays. Enter your credentials to log in.

2. Click **Actions** > **Services** > **Enable Secure Shell (SSH)**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-enable_ssh.png" width="600" alt="" />

3. SSH is enabled once the following warning displays: **SSH is enabled on this host. You should disable SSH unless it is necessary for administrative purposes.**

4. Create a new **Virtual Switch** by clicking on **Networking** > **Virtual Switches** > **Add Standard Virtual Switch**. Configure it as shown in the following example:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-rpn_switch.png" width="400" alt="" />

5. Create new **VMkernel NIC** by clicking on **Networking** > **VMkernel NICs** > **Add VMkernel NIC** and configure it as follows. Make sure to tick the **vMotion** checkbox as it is required in a later part of this tutorial:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-vmkernel_nic.png" width="400" alt="" />

  <Message type="note">
    
    Make sure to configure Jumboframes (MTU 9000) both for the switch and the NIC.

  </Message>

6. Connect to your server using SSH. The SSH credentials are identical to those for the web interface.

7. Open the ESXi configuration file in a text editor:

  ```
  vi /etc/vmware/esx.conf
  ```

8. Find the identifier of the child in the RPN portgroup (in this example: `0001`):

  ```
  /net/vmkernelnic/child[0001]/portgroup = "RPN"
  ```

9. Locate the MAC address of the network card connected to the RPN (in this example: `XX:YY:ZZ:AA:BB:CC`):

  ```
  /net/pnic/child[0004]/mac = "XX:YY:ZZ:AA:BB:CC”
  ```

10. Replace the MAC of the VMKernel RPN (see the number of the child) with the MAC of the network card connected to the RPN:

  ```
  /net/vmkernelnic/child[0001]/mac = "XX:YY:ZZ:AA:BB:CC”
  ```

11. Reboot the machine to activate the new configuration.

12. Enter the ESXi web interface and click **Networking** > **Virtual Switches** > **RPN Swich** and check the IP address of the VMkernel NIC. It now has the RPN IP auto assigned to the interface via DHCP:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-rpn_switch_connected.png" width="800" alt="" />

13. Reactivte the SSH service and connect to the machine via SSH.

14. Run the following command to add the RPN route:

  ```
  esxcfg-route -a 10.88.0.0/13 [YOUR_RPN_GATEWAY_IP]
  ```

  <Message type="tip"> 

  You can find the RPN gateway either on your server's overview page in the Dedibox console or by following [this guide](https://documentation.online.net/en/dedicated-server/tutorials/network/find-rpn-gateway).

  </Message>

15. Ping the RPN-SAN to check if the RPN connection is working properly:

  ```
  ping san-1.rpn.online.net
  ```

16. Open the file `/etc/rc.local.d/local.sh` in a text editor and add the following lines to it to configure the RPN route automatically during boot:

  ```
  esxcfg-route -a 10.88.0.0/13 [YOUR_RPN_GATEWAY_IP]
  exit 0
  ```

Repeat the steps above on the second Dedibox server.

### Connecting the RPN-SAN

<Message typ="important">

The following steps require that you have a [RPN-SAN](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/storage/rpn-san) product.

</Message>

<Message type="note">

To be able to communicate with the RPN-SAN, you need to allow your servers to access it.

</Message>

1. Connect to the Dedibox Console and click **Storage** > **RPN-SAN**.

2. Select the SAN you want to configure and click **Manage**

3. Add the server(s) you want to permit to access your SAN services in the list. Optionally you can add RPN subnet IPs. Please note that if you use RPNv2, an [additional configuration](https://documentation.online.net/en/dedicated-server/network/rpn-v2#rpnv1_compatibility) is required to access the RPN-SAN.

  <Message type="note">
  
  While it is technically possible, it is not recommended to allow more than one server at a time to communicate with the SAN. The iSCSI protocol does not handle concurrency, you may lose all your data if you allow more than one server to access this storage.

  </Message>

4. Click **Save** to validate the new configuration of the SAN.

5. Connect to the ESXi web interface of your server.

6. Click **Storage** > **Adapters** > **Software iSCSI**. A configuration pop-up displays.

7. **Enable** the service. Click **Add port binding** and add the RPN Network. Then click **Add dynamic target** and enter the address of your SAN. Finally click **Save configuration**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-configure_iscsi.png" width="600" alt="" />

  ESXi rescans for devices and you can see the new iSCSI disk in the **Devices** tab of the storage section.

## Adding a new Datastore

To use the RPN-SAN with ESXi, we need to create a new datastore. To to so, follow these steps:

1. Connect to the ESXi web interface, then click **Storage** > **Datastores** > **New Datastore**.

2. Select **Create new VMFS datastore** and click **Next**.

3. Enter a name for the new datastore and select the RPN-SAN iSCSI disk from the list of available devices. Then click **Next**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-datastore_device.png" width="600" alt="" />

4. Configure the partitioning of the datastore. Then click next. A summary displays. 

5. Validate all given information and click **Finish** to format the device.

  <Message type="note">
  
  Be careful, formatting the device will delete all data you may have stored on it.

  </Message>

6. The newly created datastore displays in the datastore list and is ready for use:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-datastore_list.png" width="800" alt="" />

## Setting-up VMware vCenter Server

We now have two ESXi hosts and a RPN-SAN but no possibility to manage both hypervisors from a centralized point. Therefore we deploy a virtual machine, running on Windows Server 2016 and install the VMware vCenter Server 6.7U3j on this machine.
vCenter is a web-based tool for graphical management of the entire fabric of datacenter, cluster, network, datastore, CPUs and virtual machines in the form of a dynamic and seamless operating environment.

<Message type="important">

To proceed with these steps, you require at least one [failover IP](https://documentation.online.net/en/dedicated-server/network/ip-failover/ip-failover) with an associated [virtual MAC address](https://documentation.online.net/en/dedicated-server/network/ip-failover/virtual-mac). If you have not yet configured it, go to your [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net) before proceeding.

</Message>

<Message type="tip">

If you do not have a Windows Server 2016 ISO file, [download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2016) it directly from Microsoft.

</Message>

### Creating a Virtual Machine

1. Connect to the ESXi web interface of one of the machines.

2. Click **Storage** > **Datastore browser** to browse the contents of your datastores.

3. Once you are at the desired location for storing your ISO files, click **Upload** and select the ISO file on your local computer. Confirm by clicking **OK**. The upload progress is visible in the top right corner of the datastore browser. Once the upload is completed, you can close the datastore browser.

  <Message type="note">

  Depending on the speed of your Internet connection, the upload may take a while.

10. A summary of your settings displays, click **Finish** to import the machine into vCenter Server:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-addhost_7.png" width="600" alt="" />

Repeat the import for the second server to manage both of them centrally from the vCenter Server.

## Creating a Cluster

A cluster is a group of several machines. When a host is added to a cluster, the resources of the host become part of the resources of the cluster and all resources of the hosts within it are managed by the cluster.

1. From the **Datacenter** dashboard in your vSphere web interface click **Actions** > **New Cluster**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-new_cluster.png" width="400" alt="" />

2. Enter a Name for the cluster and activate the features you want to use:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-new_cluster_1.png" width="400" alt="" />

3. From the cluster quickstart page click **Add** in the **Add Hosts** section. Select the hosts you want to add to the cluster and click **Next**.  A summary of the hosts that will be added to the cluster displays. 

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-new_cluster_2.png" width="600" alt="" />

4. Click **Next** to continue:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-new_cluster_3.png" width="600" alt="" />

5. Review your configuration and click **Finish** to add the hosts to the cluster:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-new_cluster_4.png" width="600" alt="" />

6. Configure the cluster by clicking on **Configure** in the **Configure cluster** section on the cluster quickstart page:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-new_cluster_5.png" width="500" alt="" />

## Migrating Virtual Machines

vCenter Server supports the [vMotion technology](https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere/vmotion.html) for live migration of virtual machines without any downtime. This allows you to:

- Automatically optimize virtual machines within resource pools.
- Perform hardware maintenance without scheduling downtime or disrupting business operations.
- Move virtual machines away from failing or underperforming machines.

The virtual machine retains its network identity and connections, ensuring a seamless migration process which completes in several seconds. It uses the RPN connection between your servers to avoid any impact on the public Internet connection, however some restrictions apply:

- The origin and destination machine must be in the same [RPN group](https://documentation.online.net/en/dedicated-server/tutorials/network/rpn#create_a_rpn_group).
- Both servers must be connected to the same RPN-SAN and the VM uses the RPN-SAN as datastore.
- You have ticket the **vMotion** checkbox on the RPN VMkernel network interface on both machines.
- No virtual CD/DVD drives are connected or any local datastore is in use on the VM.

1. Click the name of the instance you want to migrate to view its details.

2. Click **Actions** > **Migrate** to launch the migration wizard.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-vm_migrate.png" width="400" alt="" />

3. Select **Change compute resource only**, as we keep the data of the virtual machine on our RPN-SAN datastore, and click **Next**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-vm_migrate_1.png" width="600" alt="" />

4. Select the new compute resource to run the virtual machine on. In case you forgot on which physical machine the VM runs, click **VM origin**. Click **Next** to proceed:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-vm_migrate_2.png" width="600" alt="" />

5. Validate the network settings for the virtual machine. Leave the default values and click **Next** to proceed:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-vm_migrate_3.png" width="600" alt="" />

6. Select **Schedule vMotion with high priority** to complete the migration with more allocated CPU resources, then click **Next**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-vm_migrate_4.png" width="600" alt="" />

7. A summary of your migration displays. Click **Finish** to launch the migration process:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-vm_migrate_5.png" width="600" alt="" />

8. Once the migration is complete, you see a notification in **Recent Tasks** bar:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-recent_tasks.png" width="800" alt="" />

9. Update the destination host of your failover IP, either from the [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net) or by using the [Dedibox API](https://console.online.net/en/api/).

## Conclusion

You have now completed the setup of a two node ESXi cluster with RPN-SAN as shared datastore. You got the basics of managing it using vCenter Server and vSphere and were able to move your VM between the two nodes using the vMotion feature over the RPN.
