## Introduction to Identity and Access Management (IAM)

This video provides a quick overview of Scaleway's Identity and Access Management (IAM) feature. We show our existing users how to activate IAM on their account, demonstrate the instant migration process, and present the functionalities you have access to in the Scaleway console via your IAM dashboard.

<Message type="note">

  Only users who created their accounts before 5 December 2022 need to activate IAM as shown in the video. Users who created their accounts after this date have IAM automatically activated for them.
