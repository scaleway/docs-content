Jitsi Meet is an open-source video conferencing solution, providing virtual meeting rooms for remote team meetings. The sofware provides high video and audio quality and supports fully encrypted connections using TLS/SSL and [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificates.

The tool provides features similar to commercial solutions, including:

- Sharing of desktops, presentations, and more
- Inviting users to a conference via a simple, custom URL
- Editing documents together using Etherpad
- Trading messages and emojis while video conferencing, with integrated chat.

## Installing Jitsi Meet

1. [Connect to your Instance via SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/).
2. Configure the hostname of the server corresponding to your domain / subdomain name. Replace `jitsi.mydomain.tld` with the subdomain pointed to your Instance.
    ```
    hostnamectl set-hostname jitsi
    sed -i 's/^127.0.1.1.*$/127.0.1.1 jitsi.mydomain.tld jitsi/g' /etc/hosts
    ```
3. Update the software already installed on the system:
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
4. Install a [Nginx](https://nginx.org) server before installing Jitsi Meet. The Nginx server will serve as a reverse proxy for the Jitsi web interface. The Jitsi installation tool will take care of the configuration of Nginx, if it is present on the system. Run the following commands to install and enable Nginx:
    ```
    apt install -y nginx
    systemctl start nginx.service
    systemctl enable nginx.service
    ```

    <Message type="important">
        If Nginx or Apache is not present on the system, Jitsi Meet will automatically install [Jetty](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) during the installation.

5. Download the APT key and setup the repositories of Jitsi, to install the software with `apt`.
    ```
    wget -qO - https://download.jitsi.org/jitsi-key.gpg.key | apt-key add -
    sh -c "echo 'deb https://download.jitsi.org stable/' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jitsi-stable.list"
    apt update -y
    ```
6. Launch the installation of Jitsi Meet.
    ```
    apt install -y jitsi-meet
    ```

  During the installation you will be prompted to:

    - Enter the FQDN of your Instance. For example `jitsi.mydomain.tld` and press **Enter**:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-jitsi_hostname.webp" alt="" />

    - Choose the SSL certificate option `Generate a new self-signed certificate (You will later get a chance to obtain a Let's Encrypt certificate)` and press **Enter**.
7. Run the script `/usr/share/jitsi-meet/scripts/install-letsencrypt-cert.sh` to obtain a [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) SSL certificate for your Instance:
    ```
    /usr/share/jitsi-meet/scripts/install-letsencrypt-cert.sh
    ```

  During the certificate request, you are asked to enter your e-mail address to receive notifications regarding your certificate.
8. Your private Jitsi Meet Instance is ready for a first conference call. Open a Web-browser and type the FQDN of your Instance, for example: `https://jitsi.mydomain.tld`. The following screen will appear:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-jitsi_home.webp" alt="" />

  Enter a name for your conference and press `Go` to enter the conference room. It is now possible to share the link, to set a password, configure the audio and video quality and more for the conference.

        Jitsi requires access to your camera and microphone. Authorize the use of these devices on your computer when prompted to do so by your web browser.
