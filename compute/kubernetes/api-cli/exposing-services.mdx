## Exposing the Ingress Controller through a Load Balancer service

<Message type="note">

You need a Kubernetes cluster deployed with an ingress controller. 
To deploy your cluster with a preinstalled ingress controller, enter the Advanced Options during cluster creation, set Deploy an ingress controller to **Yes**, and select the ingress controller from the dropdown list:

<Lightbox src="scaleway_deploy_ingress.webp" alt="" />

</Message>

An Ingress Controller is an entry point that ingests your HTTP/HTTPS traffic and dispatches it to your services. More closely, it is a reverse proxy that will dynamically configure itself and will forward HTTP/HTTPS traffic to your services.

Scaleway Kubernetes has implemented the following ingress controllers: `nginx`, `traefik`, and `traefik2`.

### Exposing Nginx 

1. Create and open the file `nginx-loadbalancer.yml` in your favorite text editor and copy the following content into it:

    ```yml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: nginx-ingress
      namespace: kube-system
      labels:
        k8s.scw.cloud/ingress: nginx
    spec:
      type: LoadBalancer
      ports:
      - port: 80
        name: http
        targetPort: 8000
      - port: 443
        name: https
        targetPort: 8443
      selector:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: nginx
    ```

2. Use `kubectl` to deploy the configuration:

    ```s
    $ kubectl create -f nginx-loadbalancer.yml
    service/nginx-ingress created
    ```

3. Verify that your Load Balancer has been deployed correctly:

    ```
    # kubectl get svc -n kube-system
    nginx-ingress    Load Balancer   10.32.18.72    51.159.24.212   80:30122/TCP,443:31362/TCP   90s
    ```

    You can see here that the IP address of your Load Balancer is 51.159.24.212. If you ‘curl’ it you can reach the default backend(displaying “404 page not found”) as no ingress objects are created and you are reaching it through the IP address:

    ```s
    $ curl 51.159.24.212
    404 page not found
    ```

    <Message type="note">

    It may take a few minutes until your cluster is fully deployed and Nginx becomes available.

    </Message>


### Exposing Traefik2

To expose Traefik2 with a Scaleway Load Balancer, deploy the following `yaml` file on your cluster:

1. Create and open the file `traefik-loadbalancer.yml` in a text editor and copy the following content into it:

    ```yml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: traefik-ingress
      namespace: kube-system
      labels:
        k8s.scw.cloud/ingress: traefik2
    spec:
      type: LoadBalancer
      ports:
      - port: 80
        name: http
        targetPort: 8000
      - port: 443
        name: https
        targetPort: 8443
      selector:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: traefik
    ```

2. Use `kubectl` to deploy the configuration:

    ```s
    $ kubectl create -f traefik-loadbalancer.yml
    service/traefik-ingress created
    ```

3. Verify that your Load Balancer has been deployed correctly:

    ```
    $ kubectl get svc -n kube-system
    traefik-ingress   Load Balancer   10.37.89.202    195.154.68.108   80:30509/TCP,443:32138/TCP   43s
    ```

    You can see here that the IP address of your Load Balancer is 195.154.68.108. If you ‘curl’ it you can reach the default backend(displaying “404 page not found”) as no ingress objects are created and you are reaching it through the IP address:

    ```s
    $ curl 195.154.68.108
    404 page not found
    ```

    <Message type="note">

    It may take a few minutes until your cluster is fully deployed and Traefik becomes available.

    </Message>


## Creating a Load Balancer service 

1. Create a YAML manifest called `lb.yaml` and paste the following content into it. Then save the file and quit your text editor: 

    ```yml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: traefik-ingress
      namespace: kube-system
      labels:
        k8s-app: traefik-ingress-lb
    spec:
      type: LoadBalancer
      ports:
      - port: 80
        name: http
        targetPort: 80
      - port: 443
        name: https
        targetPort: 443
      selector:
        k8s-app: traefik-ingress-lb
    ```

2. Run the following command to 
    ```sh
    # kubectl create -f lb.yaml
    service/traefik-ingress created
    ```

    This manifest creates a service of the Load Balancer type. With it, you will get a public IP address. As this Load Balancer is created on Scaleway, you can also see it in your console.

    <Message type="tip">
    
    The Load Balancer is managed automatically for you by the cloud controller manager. If you want to know more about our cloud controller manager, check out [our dedicated documentation](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cloud-controller-manager).

    </Message>

3. Get the IP address of your newly created Load Balancer:

    ```
    # kubectl get svc -n kube-system
    nginx-ingress    Load Balancer   10.32.18.72    51.159.24.212   80:30122/TCP,443:31362/TCP   90s
    ```

## Using the Kubernetes Kapsule Wildcard DNS

By default, on Kubernetes Kapsule, a wildcard round-robin DNS record is created, pointing to all your cluster nodes. This means that every time you add or delete a node in your cluster, the DNS record is updated to reflect the state of your nodes.

1. Test the DNS entry of your Kubernetes Kapsule cluster (you can get the FQDN of your cluster in the Scaleway console):

    ```bash
    # host test.c39a0d71-f66c-4657-8fe1-c3280012311c.nodes.k8s.fr-par.scw.cloud
    test.49087273-8296-46cc-a82c-f08cb9623ce2.nodes.k8s.fr-par.scw.cloud is an alias for 49087273-8296-46cc-a82c-f08cb9623ce2.nodes.k8s.fr-par.scw.cloud
    49087273-8296-46cc-a82c-f08cb9623ce2.nodes.k8s.fr-par.scw.cloud has address 51.15.207.3
    ```

2. Use a test application called `cafe-ingress`, to test the way it works. The application serves different web pages depending on the URL you type. Deploy it with the following command: 

    ```sh
    $ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/master/examples/complete-example/cafe.yaml
    ```

3. Create the ingress object with this YAML manifest, called `cafe-ingress.yml`. Please note that we use our DNS wildcard on the host stanza of this YAML file.

    ```yml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
    name: cafe-ingress
    spec:
    rules:
    - host: test.49087273-8296-46cc-a82c-f08cb9623ce2.nodes.k8s.fr-par.scw.cloud
        http:
        paths:
        - path: /tea
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
            service:
                name: tea-svc
                port:
                number: 80
        - path: /coffee
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
            service:
                name: coffee-svc
                port:
                number: 80
    ```

4. Deploy the application and check its status: 

    ```sh
    # kubectl create -f cafe-ingress.yaml
    # kubectl get ing
    NAME           CLASS    HOSTS                                                                  ADDRESS   PORTS   AGE
    cafe-ingress   <none>   test.49087273-8296-46cc-a82c-f08cb9623ce2.nodes.k8s.fr-par.scw.cloud             80      4m11s
    ```

    You can test that this ingress is configured correctly by accessing your test application:

    ```sh
    # curl http://test.49087273-8296-46cc-a82c-f08cb9623ce2.nodes.k8s.fr-par.scw.cloud/coffee
    Server address: 100.64.0.181:8080
    Server name: coffee-5f56ff9788-68xs2
    Date: 28/Apr/2020:13:34:26 +0000
    URI: /coffee
    Request ID: 9d2ee64655b936384a64cf89e7a975b0
    ```

## Creating a wildcard DNS record and point your domain name to the IP address

1. Create a wildcard DNS record, using the [Scaleway DNS](https://console.scaleway.com/domains/external) product, pointing to this IP address (the domain used in this tutorial will be “mytest.com”). A wildcard record (*.mydomain.com) allows you to point any sub-domain of your domain to the configured IP address.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway_traefik_wildcard.webp" alt="" />

2. Verify that the domain is pointed to the IP address of your Load Balancer:

    ```sh
    $ host foobar.mytest.com
    foobar.mytest.com has address 195.154.68.108
    ```
    
    Your domain is now pointing to your Load Balancer IP, you can resolve any of your subdomain with that IP.

## Deploying Cert Manager

Cert-manager is in charge of creating [Let’s Encrypt](https://www.letsencrypt.org/) TLS certificates to secure your website, to sum-up:

* Create an ingress object for a specific subdomain (for instance `foobar.mytest.com`)
* Let’s Encrypt must be sure that the domain belongs to you. For this reason, Let’s Encrypt requests a “challenge”, in our case, an HTTP challenge. Meaning here that Let’s Encrypt will try to reach foobar.mytest.com, and is able to see a specific hash on this page.
* Cert-manager is serving this page for you by creating an ingress object and using an HTTP server.
* When the challenge is ok, the certificate is created and added in a certificate object.
* You can then use this certificate object to serve your website securely (HTTPS).

<Message type="note">

Any modification to the Traefik2 deployed by Kapsule may be overwritten by the reconciliation process, consider installing it yourself for a production usage.

</Message>

1. Modify the default Traefik 2 daemonset running on Kapsule to do that, add `--providers.kubernetesIngress.ingressClass=traefik-cert-manager` in the cmd stanza.

    ```
    $ kubectl edit ds traefik -n kube-system
    daemonset.apps/traefik edited
    []
            - --global.checknewversion
            - --global.sendanonymoususage
            - --entryPoints.traefik.address=:9000
            - --entryPoints.web.address=:8000
            - --entryPoints.websecure.address=:8443
            - --providers.kubernetesIngress.ingressClass=traefik-cert-manager
            - --api.dashboard=true
            - --ping=true
            - --providers.kubernetescrd
            - --providers.kubernetesingress
    []
    ```

2. Delete the existing Traefik pods in order to get the new arguments.

    ```
    $ kubectl -n kube-system delete pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=traefik
    ```

3. Use the command below to install cert-manager and its needed CRD (Custom Resource Definitions):

    ```
    $ kubectl apply --validate=false -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.1.1/cert-manager.yaml
    customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/certificaterequests.cert-manager.io created
