## AI Inference (Early Access only) 

AI Inference at Scale will allow anyone with a trained model to deploy it in Scaleway environment. Inference is the process of taking that model, deploying it onto a device, which will then process incoming data (usually images or video) to look for and identify whatever it has been trained to recognise.
