IAM Members can now be created, managed, and deleted in Scaleway Organizations. 

Members are users who only exist in one Organization and can not own their own Organization. IAM Administrators can manage Member credentials and enforce security requirements for members to ensure Organization security. [Inviting Guests](/iam/how-to/invite-user-to-orga/) remains possible but will be deprecated in the following months.

Read our [documentation on Members](/iam/how-to/manage-members) to learn more.
