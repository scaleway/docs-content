  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have a Dedibox dedicated server
  - You have performed the [linking process](/bare-metal/dedibox/how-to/link-dedibox-account/) between Dedibox and Scaleway

## How to order a Dedibox

1. Click **Dedibox** in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu. The Dedibox overview page displays.
2. Click **+ Order a Dedibox server** to launch the creation wizard.
3. Choose an **Datacenter**, in which your Dedibox server will be deployed. Then select the server offer to deploy and click **Server options >**.
    <Message type="tip">
      You can group the offer list by clicking on the tab corresponding to each offer group.
    </Message>
4. Select the service level for your server. Based on the service level you can customize your server with additional options, such as storage or DDoS protection. Then click **Summary >**.
5. Read the order summary and tick the checkboxes. Click **Create a server** to confirm your order.

    A confirmation of your order displays, and your Dedibox will be delivered as soon as possible - in most cases within the following hour.

## How to install a Dedibox

After the delivery of your server, you can begin installing it.

1. Click **Dedibox** in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu.
2. Choose the Dedibox server you want to install from the list.
3. Click **Install** to launch the OS installation wizard.
4. Select the type and version of the operating system you want to install.
    <Message type="tip">
      For more information about OS types, refer to the [dedicated servers concepts page](/bare-metal/dedibox/concepts/#os-type).
    </Message>
5. Personalize the following [partitioning](/bare-metal/dedibox/concepts/#partitioning) parameters:
    - the file system (ext4, ext3, ext2, xfs, reiserfs, nfts, swap)
    - the mount point of the partition
    - the partition size
    - the software raid (RAID 0/1/5)

    <Message type="note">
      When you start a CentOS installation with custom partitioning, you need to keep about 5 GB of unallocated disk space to prevent the automatic installation system from crashing.
    </Message>
6. Configure the system parameters. You can edit parameters such as the name of the server, add a username, password and SSH key.
    <Message type="note">
      To connect to your server via SSH, it is recommended that you [create and upload your SSH key](/dedibox-console/my-account/how-to/upload-an-ssh-key) at this stage so that it can be transferred to your server during installation.
    </Message>
7. Tick the checkbox to confirm that your server can be shut down in case of abuse. Then click **Install Dedibox server**.

    The installation of your Dedibox server may take up to 20 minutes. Once complete, your server will reboot on its hard disk.

<Message type="note">
  Depending on the OS, the installation may take several minutes to complete. Certain operating systems may require additional reboots for completion. We recommend waiting 45 to 60 minutes before you connect to your server.
</Message>

## How to connect to your Dedibox

A common way of connecting to your Dedibox server is via the command line, using SSH. SSH is a secure communication protocol, which imposes an encryption key exchange at the beginning of the connection. This means that the exchange of data between the client and the server will be encrypted.

However, you may also connect to your server via a graphical interface such as Windows Remote Desktop.

You can also use FTP, SFTP or SCP to transfer data to and from your server.

## How to connect via SSH 

### From OSX (Mac) and Linux

1. Open a terminal program on your local machine.
2. Enter the command below into the terminal. Make sure you replace `your_private_key` with the filename of your private key (often `id_rsa`) and `your_server_ip` with the IP address of your server.
    ```bash
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_private_key root@your_server_ip
    ```
3. If / when prompted, allow connection to the host by typing `yes`, then press **Enter**.
    ```
    The authenticity of host 'myhost.ext (212.47.226.35)' cannot be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is 4f:ba:65:cf:14:64:a7:1e:b6:07:7c:00:71:95:21:fa.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
    ```

### From Windows

To connect to your server from Windows, you will need to use a small application called **PuTTy**, an SSH client.

To connect to your Instance from Windows, you will need to use a small application called **PuTTy**, an SSH client.

1. Download and install PuTTy [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
2. Launch PuTTy on your computer. The main screen of the application displays.
3. Enter your Instance's IP address in the **Hostname** field.
    <Message type="tip">
      To find the IP address of your Instance, log into the Scaleway console and
      click **Dedibox** in the Bare Metal section of the side menu. A list of your
      Dedibox servers and their associated IP addresses will display.
    </Message>
4. Use the side menu to navigate to the **Auth** sub-category by expanding **Connection**, then **SSH** and finally clicking on **Auth**.
5. Click the **Browse** button and select the private key file you [generated previously](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/).
6. Click **Open** at the bottom of the screen to open a connection to the server. Upon the first connection, PuTTY asks you to allow the connection to the host.
7. Click **OK** to confirm. The terminal window displays.
8. Enter your username and password to authenticate against the server with your SSH key.

    You are now connected to your server.

## How to connect via Remote Desktop

The following steps show you how to connect to your Dedibox on which you have installed Windows Server, from your local Windows machine.

1. Open the **Remote Desktop Connection** tool on your local Windows machine.
2. Click the drop-down arrow next to **Show connections**.
3. Enter the following information:
    - In **Computer**, enter the IP address of your Dedibox server (e.g. 163.172.20.01).
    - In **Username**, for a Windows Server type **Administrateur**.
4. Click **Connect**. You are prompted to enter a password.
5. Enter the password that you set during installation of your Dedibox Windows Server machine, and click **OK**.
6. You may be asked to confirm that you want to connect. Click **Yes**.

    You are connected to the graphical interface of your Windows Server.
