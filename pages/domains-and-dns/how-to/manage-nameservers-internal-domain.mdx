Scaleway Domains and DNS provides a managed DNS solution by providing default name servers for each domain name. If you want to use your own DNS servers, you can edit the name servers associated with your domain name.

When adding name servers with Domains and DNS, you must ensure that they are [resolvable](/domains-and-dns/concepts/#domain-name-resolution) in the DNS. Each name server must have [A](/domains-and-dns/reference-content/understanding-dns-records/#a-record) and/or [AAAA](/domains-and-dns/reference-content/understanding-dns-records/#aaaa-record) records. These records link the name server's domain name (for example `ns0.mydomain.com`) to its corresponding IP address.

This is a critical step, especially when configuring [glue records](/domains-and-dns/concepts/#glue-record), which are necessary for resolving domain names in cases where the name servers are within the same domain.

For example, if you own `mydomain.com` and want to use `ns0.mydomain.com` and `ns1.mydomain.com` as your name servers, you must first create A/AAAA records for `ns0` and `ns1` in the `mydomain.com` DNS zone. This links `ns0.mydomain.com` and `ns1.mydomain.com` to their respective IP addresses, making them resolvable.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A domain name registered with Scaleway Domains and DNS
- Created an [A record](/domains-and-dns/reference-content/understanding-dns-records/#a-record) or an [AAAA record](/domains-and-dns/reference-content/understanding-dns-records/#aaaa-record) for the name servers you want to manage

1. Click **Domains and DNS** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Domains and DNS dashboard displays.
2. Click the domain name you want to configure. The **Overview** tab for your domain displays.
3. Click **Edit** in the **Name servers** section.
4. Edit the name server information. For each name server, you can provide:
    * A name server
    * An IPv6 address
    * An IPv4 address
    <Message type="tip">
      IP addresses are only required if you want to create **glue records**. A glue record provides the IP address of a name server so that DNS can resolve the domain name if the domain uses name servers hosted under that same domain name.
    </Message>
5. Optionally, click **Add name server** to add more name servers and enter your server's information.
    <Message type="tip">
      We recommend you configure a minimum of two and a maximum of seven DNS servers for each domain name.
    </Message>
6. Click the <Icon name="delete" /> icon to delete a name server.
7. Click the <Icon name="validate" /> icon to validate your configuration.
8. Click the <Icon name="cancel" /> icon to cancel all the changes you have made.
