VPC allows you to build your own **V**irtual **P**rivate **C**loud on top of Scaleway's shared public cloud. Within each VPC, you can create **Private Networks** and attach Scaleway resources to them, as long as the resources are in an AZ within the network's region. Attached resources can then communicate between themselves in isolated and secured networks, away from the public internet. The [routing](/vpc/concepts/#routing) feature allows the different Private Networks of a VPC to communicate with each other. More features and resources will be coming to the VPC product in the future.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to identify your default VPCs

### Before 13 May 2025

If you created your Scaleway [Project](/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project) before 13 May 2025, one **default VPC** was automatically created in it for each region (Paris, Amsterdam and Warsaw).

Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the Scaleway console side menu. Your VPC [dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/vpc/vpc) displays:

    <Lightbox image={image} alt="" />

You see three default VPCs (each with a **DEFAULT** badge next to it), one for each of the following regions:

- Paris `PAR`
- Amsterdam `AMS`
- Warsaw `WAW`

Each of these VPCs is named `default`, though you can [edit](#how-to-edit-a-vpcs-name-and-tags) the name if you wish, or delete the default VPCs.

### After 13 May 2025

If you created your Scaleway Project after 13 May 2025, default VPCs are no longer pre-created for you. You must create a VPC before you can create a Private Network.

## How to create a VPC

1. Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the Scaleway console side menu.

2. Click <Icon name="plus" /> **Create a VPC**. The VPC creation wizard displays.

3. Choose a **region** in which to create your VPC.

4. Enter a **name** for your VPC (or use the wand icon to generate a random name). Optionally, you can also add **tags** to help organize your VPCs. Each tag should be separated by a space.

    <NetworkResourceNaming />

    <Message type="note">
    You can create Private Networks in this VPC after you have created the VPC itself. However, you can not move an existing Private Network from one VPC to another.
    </Message>

5. Click **Create VPC** to finish.

    Your VPC is created, and you are redirected to its **Overview** page.

## How to edit a VPC's name and tags

1. Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the Scaleway console side menu. A list of your VPCs displays.

2. Click the VPC you want to edit. The VPC's **Private Networks** dashboard displays.

3. Click the **Overview** tab.

4. Make the following edits as required:

    <Lightbox image={image3} alt="" />

    - Hover your mouse over the VPC's name at the top of the page, and click the <Icon name="edit" /> icon that displays. Edit the name as required, and click <Icon name="validate" /> when you're done.
    - Click into the box marked **Tags** and start typing. Hit the spacebar to create the tag. Click the **X** next to any tag to delete it.
