## Cloudera CDH Overview

[CDH (Clouderaâ€™s Distribution including Apache Hadoop)](https://www.cloudera.com/products/open-source/apache-hadoop/key-cdh-components.html) is an open source platform distribution including [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/), [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), [Apache Impala](https://impala.apache.org/), [Apache Kudu](https://kudu.apache.org/), [Apache HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/), and many more. The software is maintained by the company [Cloudera](https://www.cloudera.com/) and is available both in a free community edition and in an enterprise edition that proposes advanced features.

CDH features all the leading components to store, process, discover, model, and serve unlimited data and is built entirely on open standards.

This tutorial is designed for [Bare Metal servers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/bare-metal-servers/), but Cloudera can also be installed on [Scaleway Dedibox servers](https://www.scaleway.com/fr/dedibox) or [Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/). For more information about cluster sizing, you can read the [Hardware](https://docs.cloudera.com/cdpdc/7.0/release-guide/topics/cdpdc-hardware-requirements.html) requirements article.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have [created at least two Bare Metal servers](/compute/bare-metal-cloud/how-to/create-server/) running on Ubuntu Bionic Beaver to form a cluster. For optimal performance it is recommended to use **GP-BM1-M** Bare Metal servers for smaller projets or **HM-BM1-M** Bare Metal servers for advanced projets that require large amounts of RAM.

## Creating an SSH key compatible with Cloudera

Cloudera requires an SSH key in the OpenSSL format.

1. Generate a RSA key for the communication from the Cloudera Manager with the nodes:

  ```
  openssl genrsa -out key.pem 4096
  ```

2. Set the read and write permissions to the user only:

  ```
  chmod a-rw key.pem
  chmod u+rw key.pem
  ```

3. Extract the public key:

  ```
  ssh-keygen -y -f key.pem > public.pub
  ```

4. Display the public key and [upload it](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/#how-to-upload-the-public-ssh-key-to-the-scaleway-interface) to your Scaleway management console:

  ```
  cat public.pub
  ```

## Installing Cloudera Manager

</Message>

1. Log into the Master machine via SSH:

  ```
  ssh root@bare-metal-server-ip
  ```

2. Download the `archive.key` for Ubuntu Bionic Beaver and add it to `apt`, to be able to use the Cloudera repository.

  ```
  wget https://archive.cloudera.com/cm6/6.3.1/ubuntu1804/apt/archive.key
  apt-key add archive.key
  ```

3. Add the Cloudera repository information to the `apt` packet manager:

  ```
  add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] http://archive.cloudera.com/cm6/6.3.1/ubuntu1804/apt bionic-cm6.3.1 contrib"
  ```

  <Message type="important">

  </Message>

4.  Update the apt repository data:

  ```
  apt update
  ```

5. Install the Oracle JDK:

  ```
  apt install oracle-j2sdk1.8

  ```

  <Message type="important">

  By installing the Oracle JDK, you have to agree to the [Oracle Binary Code License Agreement](Oracle Binary Code License Agreement).   If you don't want to agree to the Oracle Binary Code License Agreement, you can install [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/), an open-source implementation of the Java Platform, manually on all hosts in your cluster:  
  > `apt install openjdk-8-jdk`

  </Message>

6. Install Cloudera Manager via the `apt` packet manager:

  ```
  apt install cloudera-manager-daemons cloudera-manager-agent cloudera-manager-server
  ```

## Installing and Configuring a Database for Cloudera Manager

Execute the following steps on the Master machine.

1. Install [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/), an open-source fork of the [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database engine:

  ```
  apt install mariadb-server libmysql-java
  ```

2. Run the [secure installation wizzard](/tutorials/mariadb-ubuntu-bionic) to secure the database root account and to remove unused contents:

  ```
  mysql_secure_installation
  ```

3. Connect to the MySQL shell as root:

  ```
  mysql -u root -p
  ```

4. Create the MySQL databases required for Cloudera. Replace `<password>` with a secure password of your choice:

  ```
  # Cloudera Manager Server
  CREATE DATABASE scm DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
  GRANT ALL ON scm.* TO 'scm'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';

  # Activity Monitor
  CREATE DATABASE amon DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
  GRANT ALL ON amon.* TO 'amon'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';

  # Reports Manager
  CREATE DATABASE rman DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
  GRANT ALL ON rman.* TO 'rman'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';

  # Hue
  CREATE DATABASE hue DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
  GRANT ALL ON hue.* TO 'hue'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';

  # Hive Metastore Server
  CREATE DATABASE metastore DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
  GRANT ALL ON metastore.* TO 'hive'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';

  # Sentry Server
  CREATE DATABASE sentry DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
  GRANT ALL ON sentry.* TO 'sentry'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';

  # Cloudera Navigator Audit Server
  CREATE DATABASE nav DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
  GRANT ALL ON nav.* TO 'nav'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';

  # Cloudera Navigator Metadata Server
  CREATE DATABASE navms DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
  GRANT ALL ON navms.* TO 'navms'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';

  # Oozie
  CREATE DATABASE oozie DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
  GRANT ALL ON oozie.* TO 'oozie'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
  ```

5. Verify that all databases are available:

  ```
  SHOW DATABASES;
  ```

  The output looks like the following example:

  ```
  +--------------------+
  | Database           |
  +--------------------+
  | amon               |
  | hue                |
  | information_schema |
  | metastore          |
  | mysql              |
  | nav                |
  | navms              |
  | oozie              |
  | performance_schema |
  | rman               |
  | scm                |
  | sentry             |
  +--------------------+
  12 rows in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

6. Quit the MySQL shell once all tables are configured:

  ```
  quit;
  ```

7. Open the MySQL configuration file `/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf` in a text editor:

  ```
  nano /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf
  ```

8. Comment-out the line `bind-address` by putting a `#` in front of it to enable remote connections to the MariaDB server:

  <Message type="important">
  
  Once uncommented, the database server will be reachable from any machine connected to the Internet. It is recommended to limit the access to the IPs of the cluster by setting up a [firewall](/tutorials/installation-uncomplicated-firewall/) on the machine.

  </Message>

  ```
  # Instead of skip-networking the default is now to listen only on
  # localhost which is more compatible and is not less secure.
  #bind-address           = 127.0.0.1
  ```

9. Save the file, exit the text editor and restart MariaDB:

  ```
  service mysql restart
  ```

## Setting up the Cloudera Manager Database

After installing and configuring the database server on the master machine, continue by setting up the Cloudera Manager Database. The application comes with a script that can automatically:

  - Create the Cloudera Manager Server database configuration file.
  - Configure a database for Cloudera Manager Server to use.
  - Create and configure a user account for Cloudera Manager Server.

1. Run the script to initalize the database. The command requires that both, a database and a user called `scm` are created in the previous step.

  ```
  /opt/cloudera/cm/schema/scm_prepare_database.sh mysql scm scm
  ```

2. When prompted enter the password for the user `scm`:

  ```
  Enter SCM password:
  ```

3. An output like the following should display on the screen:

  ```
  JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64
  Verifying that we can write to /etc/cloudera-scm-server
  Creating SCM configuration file in /etc/cloudera-scm-server
  Executing:  /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64/bin/java -cp /usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar:/usr/share/java/oracle-connector-java.jar:/usr/share/java/postgresql-connector-java.jar:/opt/cloudera/cm/schema/../lib/* com.cloudera.enterprise.dbutil.DbCommandExecutor /etc/cloudera-scm-server/db.properties com.cloudera.cmf.db.
  2019-07-25 16:47:58,307 [main] INFO  com.cloudera.enterprise.dbutil.DbCommandExecutor  - Successfully connected to database.
  All done, your SCM database is configured correctly!
  ```

4. Start the Cloudera SCM Server:

  ```
  systemctl start cloudera-scm-server
  ```

  <Message type="important"> 
  
  Starting the Cloudera SCM Server may take some minutes. You can follow the startup process with the following command:  
  > `tail -f /var/log/cloudera-scm-server/cloudera-scm-server.log`  
  > The SCM server is ready when the following line appears:  
  > `INFO WebServerImpl:com.cloudera.server.cmf.WebServerImpl: Started Jetty server.`

  </Message>

## Installing CDH and Other Software

Continue the installation of CDH and other required software on the master host.

1. Open a web browser and go to `http://<cloudera_server_host>:7180`, where `<cloudera_server_host>` stands for the IP address of the Cloudera server.

2. The login screen displays:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-cloudera_login.png" alt="" />

  Use these credentials to login:

    - **Username:** `admin`
    - **Password:** `admin`

3. The **Welcome Screen** displays, showing some basic information about Cloudera Manager. Click **Continue** to go to the next step of the installation progress.

## Adding Servers in a Cluster

1. Specify the **Hostnames** of the machines forming the cluster. Set the SSH Port (Default: Port 22) and click **Search**. The machines will be displayed in a list below the form. Click **Continue** to move forward to the next step.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-cloudera_scan.png" alt="" />

2. Select the **Repository** to be used for the installation of Cloudera Manager Agent, CDH and other software. Select the **Public Cloudera Repository** and choose the installation via **Parcels**. Parcels are a binary distribution format containing the program files, along with additional metadata used by Cloudera Manager. Click **Continue** to validate the form and to go to the next step.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-cloudera_repo.png" alt="" />

3. In case the **Oracle Java SE Development Kit (JDK 8)** will be installed, read the license terms and tick the box to agree. Leave the box unchecked to continue using a manually installed OpenJDK on the cluster nodes. Click **Continue** to move forward to the next step.

4. Configure the **Login credentials**. Root access to all cluster hosts is required to install the Cloudera packages. Configure the `root` login by uploading the private key file, entering the passphrase (if any) and the SSH port (Default value: 22).

5. The automatic configuration of the machines in the cluster is launched. Once done, click **Continue** to proceed to the next step.

6. In this step CDH is being downloaded and deployed on all machines in the cluster:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-cloudera_parcels.png" alt="" />

  Click **Continue** once the step has been done.

## Configuring a Cluster in Cloudera Manager

Continue to run the following steps on the master machine:

1. Choose one of the pre-defined service configurations, or select **Custom** to configure the services towards your particular needs. Click **Essentials**, then on **Continue** to setup a basic cluster.

2. Cloudera Manager assigns the roles automatically to the different machines in the cluster according to their performance. You may modify the distribution of the roles, but if assignments are made incorrectly it may have an impact on the performance of the whole cluster. Once you have validated the distribution of the roles, click **Continue** to move forward to the next step.

3. Configure the databases required for the different services. The database server is already pre-filled. Enter the passwords for the different databases as set previously. Test the connection to the database by clicking on **Test connection**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-cloudera_db.png" alt="" />

  Once the connection test is finished, click **Continue** to move to the next step.

4. Review the changes, the default values should be fine except if you want to run a specific configuration. Click **Continue** to execute the First Run command.

5. The First Run command runs a set of services for the first time to check that everything is working. This may take some time. Once the tests have been completed, click **Continue** to go to the next step.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-cloudera_firstrun.png" alt="" />

6. Once the First Run has completed as message confirming the installation of the cluster appears. Click **Finish** to leave the installation wizard:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-cloudera_ready.png" alt="" />

7. The Cloudera Manager Dashboard appears, providing an overview about the clusters status:
