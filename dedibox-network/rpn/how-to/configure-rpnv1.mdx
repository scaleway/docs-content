The private RPNv1 network is connected to the second physical interface of your Dedibox. It is connected to a totally secure network, different from the one you use to connect to the internet.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- A [Dedibox dedicated server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox) with RPNv1 connectivity

## How to create a new RPNv1 group from the Scaleway console

1. Click **RPN** > **RPN groups** in the navigation bar on top of your console to enter the [RPN groups configuration](http://console.online.net/en/server/rpn) page.
2. Click **Create group** to create a new RPN group. The group creation interface displays.
3. Enter a name for your RPN group, select the Dedibox servers you want to add to the group, and save.

    It takes about five to ten minutes to activate a new RPNv1 group. Once the group is enabled, its status changes to **active**.

## How to update or modify an RPNv1 group

1. Click **RPN** > **RPN groups** in the navigation bar on top of your console to enter the [RPN groups configuration](http://console.online.net/en/server/rpn) page.
2. Click **Edit group** below the server listing of the group you want to edit.

  * Tick the boxes next to the servers you want to remove from the group. Then click **Remove selected servers from group**.
  * Click **Add servers to the group** to add more servers to the RPN group. A pop-up displays. Tick the boxes next to the servers you want to add. Save by clicking **Add to group**.

The servers are added/removed from the group and the RPN configuration is being updated.

## How to share an RPN group with another Dedibox user

1. Click **RPN** > **RPN groups** in the navigation bar on top of your console to enter the [RPN groups configuration](http://console.online.net/en/server/rpn) page.
2. Click the **Shared groups** tab to display the list of the shared RPN groups.
3. Click **Share existing local group**. The group sharing wizard displays.
4. Select the group to share from the drop-down menu and enter the ID of the server you want to add. Then click **Share group** to save.

<Message type="note">
  The owner of the server external to your account receives an email to confirm the sharing of the RPN group. You can not reach any external server until the RPN sharing has been confirmed by the server owner.
