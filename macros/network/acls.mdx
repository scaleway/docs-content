**A**ccess **C**ontrol **L**ists (ACLs) allow you to control traffic arriving at your Load Balancer's frontend, and set conditions to **allow** traffic to pass to the backend, **deny** traffic from passing to the backend, or **redirect** traffic. Conditions can be set based on the traffic's source IP address and/or HTTP path and header, or you can choose to carry out unconditional actions. ACLs allow you to build extra security into your Load Balancer, as well as letting you redirect traffic, for example from HTTP to HTTPS.
