Packer is a popular open-source tool used for creating machine images and provisioning infrastructure. Packer plugins enhance the functionality and capabilities of Packer by providing additional features, integrations, and customization options.
The tool is designed to automate the process of building machine images for different platforms and environments, such as Scaleway. It uses a proprietary declarative configuration language (HCL) to define the steps and requirements for creating these images.

The Scaleway multi-component plugin can be used with HashiCorp Packer to create custom Scaleway images.

## Installation

### Installation from pre-built releases

#### Installation using the `packer init` command

Starting from version 1.7, Packer supports a new `packer init` command allowing automatic installation of Packer plugins. Read the [Packer documentation](https://www.packer.io/docs/commands/init) for more information.

To install this plugin, copy and paste this code into your Packer configuration. Then, run `packer init`.

```sh
packer {
  required_plugins {
    scaleway = {
      version = ">= 1.0.5"
      source  = "github.com/scaleway/scaleway"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Installation using the packer plugins install command

An alternative method to install the packer plugin from a pre-built release is to use the `packer plugins install` command.
Run the following command in a terminal to install the most recent compatible Scaleway Packer plugin, matching the version constraint.

```
packer plugins install github.com/scaleway/scaleway v1.0.x
```

<Message type="tip">
    If the version constraint is omitted, the most recent version of the plugin will be installed.
</Message>

#### Manual installation

You can download pre-compiled binary releases of the plugin, from the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/scaleway/packer-plugin-scaleway/releases). After downloading the most recent archive that matches your operating system, extract its contents to obtain the plugin binary file specific to your platform. 
For guidance on plugin installation, refer to the Packer documentation's instructions on [how to install a Packer plugin](https://www.packer.io/docs/extending/plugins/#installing-plugins).

### Installation from sources

If you prefer to build the plugin from sources, make sure you have [Go installed on your local machine](/tutorials/install-golang-ubuntu-bionic/), clone the GitHub repository locally and run the command `go build` from the root directory. Upon successful compilation, a `packer-plugin-scaleway` plugin binary file can be found in the root directory. To install the compiled plugin, follow the official [Packer documentation on installing a plugin](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/docs/plugins#installing-plugins).

## Configuration

Refer to the official [Scaleway Packer plugin documentation](https://github.com/scaleway/packer-plugin-scaleway/tree/main/docs) to gain a better understanding of how to set up the plugin.
