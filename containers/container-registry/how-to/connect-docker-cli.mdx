Docker is a tool which makes it easy to manage container images. You can use Docker to push and pull images to and from your Scaleway Container Registry. We show you how to set up Docker on your local computer to connect to your Container Registry.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have created a [Container Registry namespace](/containers/container-registry/how-to/create-namespace)
  - You have [generated your API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
  - You have installed [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on your local computer
</Message>

1. Click **Container Registry** in the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Container Registry namespaces dashboard displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" />, then **Push Instructions** next to the namespace you want to push to. A pop-up displays.
3. Copy the push instructions. Then click **X** to close the pop-up.
4. Open a terminal window on your local computer. Then log into the namespace by running the following command from the terminal:
    ```
    docker login rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/mynamespace -u nologin -p [SCW_SECRET_KEY]
    ```
    <Message type="important">
      Replace `[SCW_SECRET_KEY]` with your [API secret key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) and `mynamespace` with the name of your namespace.
    </Message>

    Once logged in, a confirmation is displayed:

    ```
    Login Succeeded
    ```

You are now logged in and ready to push and pull images to and from your Container Registry with Docker.
