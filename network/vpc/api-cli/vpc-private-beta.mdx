Private Networks allow you to create Private Networks that are scoped to a region rather than a specific [Availability Zone](/compute/instances/concepts/#availability-zone) (AZ). This means you can attach resources from multiple AZs of that region, to your Private Network.

You can find full documentation for the Scaleway VPC API on the [developers site](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/vpc/).
