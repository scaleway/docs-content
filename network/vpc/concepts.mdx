  This page concerns the **VPC** / **Regional Private Networks** product currently in [Public Beta](https://www.scaleway.com/en/betas/#regional-private-network). If you're looking for documentation about Public Gateways, see the [relocated concepts page](/network/public-gateways/concepts/) for that product.

## Regions and Availability Zones

Regions and Availability Zones (AZ) both refer to the geographical location in which a resource is created. Scaleway currently operates three regions, each of which has multiple AZs within it. Note that not all products are available in all regions/AZs. VPC is currently only available in the **France - Paris** region.

| Region                                   | Availability Zones                  |
|------------------------------------------| ----------------------------------  |
| France - Paris  `fr-par`                 | `fr-par-1` `fr-par-2` `fr-par-3`    |
| The Netherlands - Amsterdam `nl-ams`     | `nl-ams-1` `nl-ams-2`               |
| Poland - Warsaw   `pl-waw`               | `pl-waw-1` `pl-waw-2`               |

## Regional Private Networks

While Scaleway's original [Private Networks](/network/public-gateways/how-to/use-private-networks/) product offers connectivity of your resources within a single [Availability Zone](#regions-and-availability-zones) (AZ), regional Private Networks let you connect resources across multiple AZs within the same region. Regional Private Networks are currently only available for the **France - Paris** region, providing a dedicated, private and flexible L2 network to which you can attach your Scaleway resources.

You can add as many resources (e.g. Instances, Load Balancers etc) to your regional Private Networks as you want, and add up to eight (8) different networks per resource. In the case of an Instance for example, each network it is attached to will have its own network interface in the Instance. This allows you to run services isolated from the public internet and expose them to the rest of your infrastructure without worrying about public network filtering.

Instances can be attached to and detached from a regional Private Network network at will. Even when the Instance is running the network interface will be hot-plugged to the server, and software can be configured to automatically set it up as soon as it appears.

## VPC

VPC is a set of products and features allowing you to build your own **V**irtual **P**rivate **C**loud on top of Scaleway's shared public cloud. This keeps your Scaleway resources secure and isolated, away from the public Internet.

One default VPC for every available region is automatically created in each Scaleway [Project](/console/my-project/concepts/#project). Currently VPC is only available for the Paris `PAR` region.

VPC currently comprises the [regional Private Networks](#regional-private-networks) product.
