Default Instance images for Ubuntu, Debian and CentOS support autoconfiguration of interfaces plugged into a Private Network.

They leverage helper scripts provided by the scaleway-ecosystem package. These scripts:

- enable DHCP on the interfaces plugged into a Private Network
- make the default route received by DHCP the primary route for all traffic on the Instance
- keep the route to the Scaleway Metadata API more specific (see below).

If your Instance does not get autoconfigured, it may be that you are using an old version of the scaleway-ecosystem package. scaleway-ecosystem 0.0.4 or later is required. Use the following command to update it:

- On Ubuntu (Focal and Xenial) or Debian (Stretch and Buster):

    ```bash
    apt update && apt install scaleway-ecosystem
    add-apt-repository ppa:scaleway/stable && apt update && apt install scaleway-ecosystem
    apt list scaleway-ecosystem
    ```

- On Debian distributions (Bookwork, Bullseye and Buster):

    ```bash
    cat << EOF > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/scaleway-ubuntu-debian-stable-jammy.list
    deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/scaleway/debian-stable/ubuntu jammy main
    # deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/scaleway/debian-stable/ubuntu jammy main
    EOF
    apt -y update
    apt install scaleway-ecosystem
    apt list scaleway-ecosystem
    ```

- On CentOS 8 or Fedora 32, get the link to the latest release's rpm on [this page](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-packages/releases/latest) and install it as follows:

    ```bash
    # rpm -vUh https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-packages/releases/download/v0.0.4/scaleway-ecosystem-0.0.5.noarch.rpm
    ```
