Scaleway Serverless Functions makes your [functions](/serverless/functions/concepts/#function) available, executes them on demand and manages resource allocation for you.

Functions are designed for lightweight and short-lived workloads, and are limited to [a selection of runtimes](/serverless/functions/reference-content/functions-lifecycle/#available-runtimes) for optimum performance.

Refer to the [differences between Functions, Jobs, and Containers](/serverless/containers/reference-content/difference-jobs-functions-containers/) for more information on Scaleway's different Serverless products.

This page explains how to deploy, invoke, and delete a basic Node, Python, or PHP function using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).

## How to create a function

If you have no existing Serverless Functions resources in your current Project, the creation process will guide you through the creation of a namespace, and then a function.

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.

2. Click **+ Create a function**. The function [namespace](/serverless/functions/concepts/#namespace) creation wizard displays.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Enter a **name** or use the automatically generated one. The name can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes.
    - Enter an optional **description**.
    - Choose a **region**, which is the geographical location in which your namespace will be deployed.
4. Click **Create namespace and add function**. The function creation wizard displays.

      Refer to the [How to create a Functions namespace](/serverless/functions/how-to/create-a-functions-namespace/) documentation page for more information on the different parameters.

5. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Choose either **Node**, **Python** or **PHP** as a runtime.
    - Select **Deploy "Hello world"** if you want to deploy a basic function, or select **Inline code editor** to enter your own function code.
    - If you used the code editor, enter the [handler](/serverless/functions/concepts/#handler) of your function.
    - Enter a **name** or use the automatically generated one. The name can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes.
    - Enter an optional **description**.
    - Choose the smallest **resources** available to allocate to your function.
    - Leave the default **scaling** values.
    - In the **Advanced options**, set the **Function privacy policy** to **public**.
    - Verify the **estimated cost**.

6. Click **Create function**. The deployment takes several minutes to complete. Check the **Overview** tab to see the function's status.

## How to test a function

1. Click the **Test** tab of your function.

2. Set the **Method** to `GET` and the **Path** to `/`.

3. Click the **Run** button to start the test.

The **Output** section displays the response from your function and the status code.

## How to delete a function

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.

2. Click the relevant functions namespace.

3. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the function you want to delete, and select **Delete** from the drop-down menu.

4. Type **DELETE** in the pop-up that asks you to confirm the action, then click **Delete function**.

<Message type="tip">
  You can also delete a function from the function's **Overview** tab.
