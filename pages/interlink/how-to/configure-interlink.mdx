<Message type="important">
InterLink is currently in [Private Beta](https://www.scaleway.com/en/betas/), and only available to selected testers.
</Message>

Once your InterLink has been [provisioned](/interlink/how-to/complete-provisioning/) by your chosen partner, a number of configuration steps become available to you. These steps must be carried out in order for traffic to successfully flow over your InterLink:

- Attach a VPC
- Create and attach an allowed routes list
- Activate route propagation

<Lightbox src="scaleway-interlink-config.webp" alt="A four-step flow chart shows the following steps: 1. Create InterLink, 2. Attach VPC, 3. Attach allowed routes list, 4. Activate route propagation. After these steps are complete, traffic can flow across the InterLink" />

This document explains how to complete these configuration steps with the Scaleway console.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Ordered an InterLink](/interlink/how-to/order-interlink/) which has been [provisioned](/interlink/how-to/complete-provisioning/) by the partner

## How to attach a VPC

Attaching an InterLink to a VPC allows you to complete the connection from your external infrastructure, across the InterLink, to the Scaleway resources in the selected VPC.

1. Click **InterLink** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. A listing of your InterLinks displays.

2. Click on the InterLink that you want to configure. The InterLink's **Overview** page displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-interlink-overview-up.webp" alt="A screen in the Scaleway console shows an overview of an InterLink's partner, location, region, bandwidth, creation date, pairing key, and IPv4/IPv6 connectivity status. Underneath are the 'Attached VPC', 'Route propagation' and 'Tags' panels." />

3. In the **Attached VPC** section, click **Attach VPC**. A pop-up displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-interlink-attach-vpc.webp" alt="A screen in the Scaleway console invites the user to attach a VPC to complete the connection from their external infrastructure, across the InterLink to their Scaleway resources. A dropdown menu allows a VPC to be selected. A banner reminds users to check any attached route filter lists for compatibility with the selected VPC." />
 
4. Select one of your existing VPCs from the dropdown list. It must be in the same region as the InterLink. Alternatively, click **+ Create VPC** to create and attach a new VPC.

    <Message type="tip">
    An InterLink can only be attached to one VPC at a time, but you are free to detach the VPC and attach a different one whenever you like.
    </Message>

5. Click **Attach VPC**

    The VPC is attached and you are returned to the InterLink's **Overview** page.

To enable traffic to flow across the InterLink, you must still create and attach an allowed routes list, and activate route propagation.

## How to attach an allowed routes list

After attaching a VPC, the next step in configuring your InterLink is to create and attach an allowed routes list. 

The VPC and the external infrastructure's routers both announce their routes to each other via [BGP](/interlink/concepts/#border-gateway-protocol-bgp) when route propagation is activated, but all of these routes are blocked by default. Allowed routes lists let you whitelist ranges of route announcements to allow, so that traffic can flow along these routes across the InterLink.

Each InterLink can have one allowed routes list attached to it, but a single allowed routes list can be attached to multiple InterLinks, if desired.

See the dedicated documentation on [creating an allowed routes list](/interlink/how-to/create-allowed-routes-list/) to create a list, then follow these instructions to attach it:

1. Click **InterLink** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. A listing of your InterLinks displays.

2. Click on the InterLink that you want to configure. The InterLink's **Overview** page displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-interlink-overview-up.webp" alt="A screen in the Scaleway console shows an overview of an InterLink's partner, location, region, bandwidth, creation date, pairing key, and IPv4/IPv6 connectivity status. Underneath are the 'Attached VPC', 'Route propagation' and 'Tags' panels." />

3. In the **Route propagation** section, click **Attach allowed routes list**. A pop-up displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-attach-allowed-routes.webp" alt="A pop-up in the Scaleway console prompts a user to select an allowed routes list from a drown down list." />

4. Select an allowed routes list from the drop-down list, and click **Attach list**.

        <Message type="tip">
        Make sure that the allowed routes list is suitable for the incoming routes (announced by the Scaleway VPC) and outgoing routes (announced by the external infrastructure) that should be propagated on this InterLink.
        </Message>

The list is attached, ad you are returned to the InterLink's **Overview** page.

## How to activate route propagation

Once you have attached a VPC and attached an allowed routes list, you can activate route propagation. This is the final step in configuring your InterLink so that traffic can flow between the VPC and your external infrastructure: it triggers the dynamic exchange of route information between the VPC and external infrastructure.

1. Click **InterLink** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. A listing of your InterLinks displays.

2. Click on the InterLink that you want to configure. The InterLink's **Overview** page displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-interlink-overview-up.webp" alt="A screen in the Scaleway console shows an overview of an InterLink's partner, location, region, bandwidth, creation date, pairing key, and IPv4/IPv6 connectivity status. Underneath are the 'Attached VPC', 'Route propagation' and 'Tags' panels." />

3. In the **Route propagation** section, use the toggle <Icon name="toggle" /> to turn route propagation **ON**.  

    A pop-up displays, showing the attached allowed routes list which will define the incoming and outgoing route announcements to accept. You can change the attached allowed routes list if you wish. 
    
    It is not possible to activate route propagation without attaching an allowed routes list, as all route announcements would be blocked, rendering the action ineffective.

4. Click **Activate route propagation**.

    Route propagation is activated, and you are returned to your InterLink's overview page. 
    
    While route propagation remains active, traffic can flow across the routes allowed over the InterLink. The VPC and external infrastructure will dynamically exchange and update route information. You can deactivate route propagation at any time: if you do so, all routes are blocked and no traffic can flow.

## How to modify your InterLink configuration

You can modify the following aspects of your InterLink configuration at any time:

- The attached Scaleway VPC
- The attached allowed routes list
- Whether route propagation is on or off

<Message type="tip">
It is not possible to modify settings that were defined at the time of creating the InterLink, such as its region, partner, location, or bandwidth. To modify any of those settings, you must delete the InterLink and create a new one.

### How to change the attached VPC

1. Click **InterLink** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. A listing of your InterLinks displays.

2. Click on the InterLink that you want to configure. The InterLink's **Overview** page displays.

3. In the **Attached VPC** section, click the unlink icon <Icon name="unlink" /> next to the VPC you want to detach.

    A pop-up displays, confirming that this action will detach the VPC, and the InterLink will not be connected to any Scaleway resources until you reattach a VPC.

    <Message type="tip">
    If route propagation was activated, it will be automatically deactivated when you detach the VPC.
    </Message>

4. Click **Detach VPC**.

    The VPC is detached, and you are returned to the InterLink's **Overview** page. No traffic can currently flow over the InterLink, and all associated routes are removed from the VPC's route table.

    Follow the next steps to attach another VPC.

5. In the **Attached VPC** section, click **Attach VPC**. A pop-up displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-interlink-attach-vpc.webp" alt="A screen in the Scaleway console invites the user to attach a VPC to complete the connection from their external infrastructure, across the InterLink to their Scaleway resources. A dropdown menu allows a VPC to be selected. A banner reminds users to check any attached route filter lists for compatibility with the selected VPC." />
 
6. Select one of your existing VPCs from the dropdown list. It must be in the same region as the InterLink. Alternatively, click **+ Create VPC** to create and attach a new VPC.

    <Message type="tip">
    Ensure that the allowed routes list that is attached to the InterLink is suitable for the VPC you are attaching. Remember that the outgoing routes in the list should correspond to the route announcements to whitelist from the VPC itself.
    </Message>

7. Click **Attach VPC**.

    The VPC is attached and you are returned to the InterLink's **Overview** page. Remember to check the Allowed routes list and activate route propagation so that traffic can flow across the InterLink.

### How to change the attached allowed routes list

1. Click **InterLink** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. A listing of your InterLinks displays.

2. Click on the InterLink that you want to configure. The InterLink's **Overview** page displays.

3. In the **Route propagation** section, click the three dot icon <Icon name="more" /> next to the Allowed routes list you want to detach. Then click **Detach list** in the menu that displays.

        A pop-up confirms that this action will detach the current list from your InterLink. If route propagation was active, it will be automatically deactivated because with no attached allowed routes list, the default rule will block the propagation of any new or updated routes.

4. Click **Detach list**.

        The list is detached, and you are returned to your InterLink's Overview page.

5. In the **Route propagation** section, under **Allowed routes list** click **+** to add a new list. See the dedicated documentation on [creating and attaching an allowed routes list](/interlink/how-to/create-allowed-routes-list/) for a step by step guide.

### How to edit an existing allowed routes list

1. Click **InterLink** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. A listing of your InterLinks displays.

2. Click on the InterLink that you want to configure. The InterLink's **Overview** page displays.

3. In the **Route propagation** section, click the three dot icon <Icon name="more" /> next to the Allowed routes list. Then click **Edit list** in the menu that displays.

        <Message type="tip">
        You can also edit allowed routes lists from their [dedicated tab in the console](https://console.scaleway.com/interlink/allowed-routes), including lists that aren't currently attached to an InterLink.
        </Message>

        The **Edit allowed routes List** wizard displays. See the dedicated documentation on [creating and attaching an allowed routes list](/interlink/how-to/create-allowed-routes-list/) for help with allowed routes lists.

4. Make the required edits, and click **Edit allowed routes list**

        A warning displays, to remind you that modifications will immediately be propagated on InterLinks using this list.

5. Click **Save**.

The list is modified and modifications are immediately applied.

### How to deactivate route propagation

1. Click **InterLink** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. A listing of your InterLinks displays.

2. Click on the InterLink that you want to configure. The InterLink's **Overview** page displays.

3. In the **Route propagation** section, use the toggle <Icon name="toggle" /> to turn route propagation **OFF**.  

    A pop-up displays, confirming that this action will turn off route propagation. All existing InterLink routes will be removed from the VPC route table. Traffic will not be able to flow over the InterLink until route propagation is reactivated.  

4. Click **Deactivate**.

    Route propagation is deactivated, and you are returned to your InterLink's overview page.
