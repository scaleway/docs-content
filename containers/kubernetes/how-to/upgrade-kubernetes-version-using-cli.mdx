<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
    - You have a working [CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli) with your credentials set up
    - You are willing to upgrade your Kubernetes Kapsule cluster to the latest k8s version available on the Kapsule API.
    you're willing to upgrade it.
</Message>

First, we need to ensure that the latest Kapsule version properly handles your workload. We have a compatibility matrix for different components and your current cluster may use components that are either deprecated or not available on the latest version.
For more information, you can refer to our [version policy](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/containers/kubernetes/reference-content/version-support-policy/).

We recommend you read the Kubernetes [changelog](https://kubernetes.io/releases/) to stay informed on the latest version upgrade.

## Checking which components must be changed

Run the following command into your terminal to retrieve a list of the components that need to be changed.  

`scw k8s version list`

You should get an output similar to the following, providing a list of all relevant components:
```
1.25.9   [cilium calico kilo]                [none]                 [containerd]
1.24.13  [cilium calico weave flannel kilo]  [none]                 [containerd crio]
1.23.17  [cilium calico weave flannel kilo]  [none nginx traefik2]  [containerd crio docker]
```

### Ingresses

Managed Ingress Controllers have been deprecated since the minor 1.24 release. As a result, we provide the EasyDeploy feature instead to set up an Ingress Controller. 
You can also deploy an Ingress Controller by yourself and fine-tune its settings according to your needs.

Run the `scw k8s cluster update $CLUSTER_ID ingress=none` command to update a cluster to a version superior to 1.23.  It is necessary to deactivate the managed Ingress Controller.

### Container runtimes

We only provide support for containerd from 1.25 and above. To migrate your existing pools, you must create new Kapsule pools with containerd as a runtime.
Complete the following steps to do so:
1. Create the pool:
  `scw k8s pool create container-runtime=containerd zone=$POOL_ZONE size=$SIZE_OF_YOUR_OLD_POOL version=$YOUR_CLUSTER_VERSION cluster-id=$CLUSTER_ID`
2. Wait for the nodes to be provisioned:
  `scw k8s pool wait $POOL_ID`
3. In parallel, you can start cordoning nodes using the old runtime. This way, the workload will get rescheduled directly on the `containerd` nodes.
  `kubectl cordon $OLD_NODE_A $OLD_NODE_B $OLD_NODE_C ...`
4. Once the new nodes are ready, you can start draining the old nodes:
<Message type="note">
You may need to add the option `--delete-emptydir-data` if you used local disk as a scratchpad.
</Message>
  `kubectl drain --ignore-daemonsets $NODE_TO_DRAIN`
    <Message type="important">
        **Do not** drain all the nodes simultaneously. Make sure to do it sequentially, while checking whether your workload is behaving as expected.
    </Message>
5. At this point, nodes from your old pool should be emptied of any workload. If so, they are ready for deletion:
  `kubectl delete node $OLD_NODE_A $OLD_NODE_B $OLD_NODE_C ...`
6. Delete your old pool:
  `scw k8s pool delete $OLD_POOL_ID`

### CNIs

If your cluster is using a deprecated CNI, and you are willing to upgrade to a newer k8s version, you will most likely have to spin up a new Kapsule cluster.
As of now, we do not provide an easy way to change CNI. This component is integrated within each cluster node. This results in a tricky transition.
For more help, check out the following resources: 
- The #k8s channel on our [Slack community](scaleway-community.slack.com)
- Our [support ticketing system](/en/docs/console/my-account/how-to/open-a-support-ticket/)

## Effective upgrade

From here, two options are available: you are either upgrading **one minor version** or **multiple ones**.

### One minor version

This option is the most straightforward and requires you to first upgrade your control-plane.
`scw k8s cluster upgrade $CLUSTER_ID version=$NEW_K8S_VERSION`

You can also upgrade the pools by appending the previous command with `upgrade-pools=true`.

Additionally, you can upgrade one pool independently by running the following command:
`scw k8s pool upgrade $POOL_ID version=$NEW_K8S_VERSION`

If you wish to migrate your workload manually, you can do so by following the steps described in the [runtimes](#container-runtimes) section.
    <Message type="important">
    Make sure to adapt the pool creation step.
    </Message>
`scw k8s pool create zone=$OLD_POOL_ZONE size=$SIZE_OF_YOUR_OLD_POOL version=$NEW_CLUSTER_VERSION cluster-id=$CLUSTER_ID`

Monitor your workload, congrats you are using a newer, maybe the latest kubernetes version.

### Multiple minors versions

The process is quite similar to the previous one except you need to repeat the steps for each minor version.
<Message type="important">
    Your pools and your control plane **should never** have more than one minor version delta.
