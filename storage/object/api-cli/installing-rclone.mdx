[Rclone](https://rclone.org) is a command-line tool that can be used to manage your cloud storage. It communicates with any S3 compatible cloud storage provider as well as other storage platforms.

Follow the instructions given in the [official rclone documentation here](https://rclone.org/install/) to install rclone. 

For example, on Linux:

- Connect to your server as `root` via [SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).

- Then, download and install Rclone with the following sequence of commands:
  ```
  wget https://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-current-linux-amd64.zip
  apt install zip
  unzip rclone-current-linux-amd64.zip
  cd rclone*linux-amd64/
  mv rclone /usr/bin/
  ```

## Configuring Rclone

1. Run the following command to begin the rclone configuration:
  ```
  $ rclone config
  ```

  If you do not have any existing remotes, the following output displays:
  ```
  2021/01/18 16:03:28 NOTICE: Config file "/root/.config/rclone/rclone.conf" not found - using defaults
  No remotes found - make a new one
  n) New remote
  s) Set configuration password
  q) Quit config
  ```

  If you have previously configured rclone you may see a slightly different output. However, that does not affect the following steps.

2. Type `n` to make a new remote. You are then prompted to type a name - here we type `remote-sw-paris`:
  ```
  n/s/q> n
  name> remote-sw-paris
  ```

  The following output displays:

  ```
  Type of storage to configure.
  Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
  Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
  1 / 1Fichier
    \ "fichier"
  2 / Alias for an existing remote
    \ "alias"
  3 / Amazon Drive
    \ "amazon cloud drive"
  4 / Amazon S3 Compliant Storage Provider (AWS, Alibaba, Ceph, Digital Ocean, Dreamhost, IBM COS, Minio, Tencent COS, etc)
    \ "s3"

  [...]
  Storage>
  ```

3. Type `s3` and hit enter to confirm this storage type. The following output displays:

  ```
  Choose your S3 provider.

  1 / Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3
    \ "AWS"

  9 / Scaleway Object Storage
    \ "Scaleway"
  10 / StackPath Object Storage
    \ "StackPath"

    \ "TencentCOS"
  12 / Wasabi Object Storage
    \ "Wasabi"
  13 / Any other S3 compatible provider
    \ "Other"
  ```

4. Type `Scaleway` and hit enter to confirm this S3 provider. The following output displays:

  ```

  Only applies if access_key_id and secret_access_key is blank.
  Enter a boolean value (true or false). Press Enter for the default ("false").
  Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
  1 / Enter AWS credentials in the next step
    \ "false"
  2 / Get AWS credentials from the environment (env vars or IAM)
    \ "true"
  env_auth>
  ```

5. Type `false` and hit enter, to be able to enter your credentials in the next step. The following output displays:
  ```
  AWS Access Key ID.
  Leave blank for anonymous access or runtime credentials.
  Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
  access_key_id>
  ```

6. Enter your [API Access Key](/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key/) and hit enter. The following output displays:
  ```
  AWS Secret Access Key (password)
  Leave blank for anonymous access or runtime credentials.
  Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
  secret_access_key>
  ```

7. Enter your API Secret Key and hit enter. The following output displays:
  ```
  Region to connect to.
  Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
  Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
  1 / Amsterdam, The Netherlands

8. Enter your chosen region and hit enter. Here we choose `fr-par`. The following output displays:
  ```
  Endpoint for Scaleway Object Storage.
  Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
  Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
  1 / Amsterdam Endpoint
    \ "s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud"
  2 / Paris Endpoint
    \ "s3.fr-par.scw.cloud"
  endpoint>
  ```

9. Enter your chosen endpoint and hit enter. Here we choose `s3.fr-par.scw.cloud`. The following output displays:

  ```
  Canned ACL used when creating buckets and storing or copying objects.

  This ACL is used for creating objects and if bucket_acl isn't set, for creating buckets too.

  For more info visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl

  Note that this ACL is applied when server side copying objects as S3
  doesn't copy the ACL from the source but rather writes a fresh one.
  Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
  Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
  1 / Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. No one else has access rights (default).
    \ "private"
  2 / Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. The AllUsers group gets READ access.
    \ "public-read"
    / Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. The AllUsers group gets READ and WRITE access.
  3 | Granting this on a bucket is generally not recommended.
    \ "public-read-write"
  4 / Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. The AuthenticatedUsers group gets READ access.
    \ "authenticated-read"
    / Object owner gets FULL_CONTROL. Bucket owner gets READ access.
  5 | If you specify this canned ACL when creating a bucket, Amazon S3 ignores it.
    \ "bucket-owner-read"
    / Both the object owner and the bucket owner get FULL_CONTROL over the object.
  6 | If you specify this canned ACL when creating a bucket, Amazon S3 ignores it.
    \ "bucket-owner-full-control"
  acl>
  ```

10. Enter your chosen ACL and hit enter. Here we choose `private` (`1`). The following output displays:
  ```

  Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
  Choose a number from below, or type in your own value

  2 / The Standard class for any upload; suitable for on-demand content like streaming or CDN.
    \ "STANDARD"
  3 / Archived storage; prices are lower, but it needs to be restored first to be accessed.
    \ "GLACIER"
  storage_class>
  ```

11. Enter your chosen storage class and hit enter. Here we choose `STANDARD` (`2`). The following output displays:
  ```
  Edit advanced config? (y/n)
  y) Yes
  n) No (default)
  y/n>
  ```

12. Type `n` and hit enter. A summary of your config displays:

  ```

  If you want to be able to transfer data to or from a bucket in a different region to the one you just set up, repeat steps 1-14 again to set up a new remote in the required region. Simply enter the required region at steps 7 and 8. Similarly, you may wish to set up a new remote for a different Object Storage provider.
