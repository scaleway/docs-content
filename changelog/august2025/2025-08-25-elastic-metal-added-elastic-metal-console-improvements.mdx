Server filtering by region: A new selector in the top-left corner lets you choose an Availability Zone (AZ) to display only the servers from that region.

All tab for server creation: When creating a server, a new All tab shows the complete list of available servers, regardless of their range.

Automatic AZ redirection: If the selected AZ is out of stock for a specific offer, the console will now redirect you to another AZ where it is available.
