The IP Address Manager (IPAM) is now in General Availability, offering several different functionalities in the Scaleway console, including viewing, tagging and filtering all private IP addresses. Users can also reserve a private IP on one of their Private Networks and use it to attach an Instance, Load Balancer or Public Gateway to the network.
