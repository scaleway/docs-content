VPC is a set of products and features that allows you to build your own **V**irtual **P**rivate **C**loud on top of Scaleway's shared public cloud. One default VPC for every available region is automatically created in each Scaleway [Project](/console/my-project/concepts/#project). Currently VPC is only available for the Paris `PAR` region. 

Within each VPC, you can create multiple **regional Private Networks** to connect your Scaleway resources across multiple AZs within the same region. This gives you a virtual Layer 2 network, allowing your resources (Instances, Elastic Metal servers, Load Balancers etc.) to communicate in an isolated and secure network, away from the public Internet.

## How to create a regional Private Network

1. Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the side menu.

    A default VPC for each available region has been automatically created for you. Currently VPC is only available for the **France - Paris** region.

2. Click the **Default VPC** for the `PAR` region.

    If you already have existing regional Private Networks in this VPC, a list of these displays. Otherwise, you see a welcome screen.

4. Enter a **name** for the network, or leave the randomly-generated name in place. Optionally, you can also add one or many tags to help you organize your Private Networks. 

5. Click **Create a regional Private Network** to finish. Your Private Network is created. You are taken back to the **regional Private Networks** dashboard, where your new regional Private Network is now displayed in the list.

## How to migrate an existing Private Network from zoned to regional

Scaleway allows you to migrate an existing zoned Private Network, which is scoped to one [Availability Zone](/network/vpc/concepts/#regions-and-availability-zones) only, to make it a regional Private Network, scoped to an entire region.

This action must be carried out using the [Scaleway VPC API](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/). For full instructions, see our [dedicated documentation](/network/vpc/api-cli/vpc-private-beta/#migrating-existing-zonal-private-networks-to-regional-private-networks).
