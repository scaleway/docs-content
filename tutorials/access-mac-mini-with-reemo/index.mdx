## Reeemo - Overview

[Reemo](https://reemo.io/) is an ultra-low latency, high performance desktop platform designed to allow anyone to connect to any computer and virtual environment from a Chrome browser to work and play freely from anywhere, on any device. 
Reemo works perfectly on MacOS, Linux, and Windows and supports multiple peripherals. _Reemo is a French startup that was part of the Scaleway Startup Program._

Scaleway’s Apple silicon M1 as-a-Service offer is highly compatible with Reemo.io. Scaleway’s Mac mini M1 is built using the latest generation of Apple Mac mini hardware.
These dedicated Mac mini M1 are designed for developing, building, testing, and signing applications for Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, Mac computers and much more. Reemo.io can be installed easily on Scaleway’s Mac mini M1 which allows you to instantly connect to your M1 remotely from a chrome browser while keeping its performance and efficiency.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to launch your Mac mini M1 development environment on Reemo.io.

  when installing it for the first time on Linux and MacOS. To change or edit this private key, you can use the Reemo.exe on Windows or edit the `reemo.ini` file directly.
