The clone feature allows you to create a new Database Instance from an existing one. The clone includes all existing databases, users, and permissions. You can create a clone on a Database Instance larger than your current one.

<Message type="note">
  The clone is fully independent of its parent.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [PostgreSQL or MySQL Database Instance](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/quickstart)

## How to clone a Database Instance

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Scroll down to the **Clone** section.
4. Click **Clone Database Instance**. A pop-up displays.
5. Enter a name for your database or leave the default name suggested by the Scaleway console.
6. Select a node type. You can keep the same node type, or upgrade to a bigger one.
    <Message type="important">
      If you have a new-generation Database Instance using a local volume node type and want to upgrade to an Instance that uses Block volumes node type, you must [change the volume type](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/change-volume-type) to Block storage first. <br /><br />

      Similarly, if you have a new-generation Database Instance using a [Low Latency Block volume](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/concepts/#block-storage-low-latency) and want to create a clone on a first-generation Instance, you must first change the volume type to [Basic Block Storage](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/concepts/#basic-block-storage).
    </Message>
7. Click **Clone Database Instance**.

<Message type="important">
  The source Database Instance remains available during the cloning process in **Backing up mode**. Some actions are not available during this time. <br /><br />
  The time it takes to clone a Database Instance with local storage depends on the size of the database. For Database Instances with Block Storage the cloning process is slightly faster.
