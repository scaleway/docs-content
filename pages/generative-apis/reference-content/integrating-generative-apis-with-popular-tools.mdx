## OpenAI client libraries

Scaleway Generative APIs follow OpenAI's API structure, making integration straightforward. To get started, you'll need to install the OpenAI library and set up your API key.

### Configuration

To use the OpenAI client library with Scaleway's Generative APIs, first install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install openai
```

Then set the API key and base URL in your OpenAI-compatible client:
```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.scaleway.ai/v1",
    api_key="<API secret key>"
)
```
<Message type="tip">
  Make sure to replace `<API secret key>` with your actual API key.
</Message>

### Using OpenAI client for text generation

To use OpenAI client for text generation, you can create a `client.chat.completions` object and call the `create` method:
```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke about AI"}]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## LangChain (RAG & LLM applications)

LangChain is a popular library for building AI applications. Scaleway's Generative APIs support LangChain for both inference and embeddings.

### Python

  Refer to our dedicated documentation for [implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain and Scaleway Generative APIs](/tutorials/how-to-implement-rag-generativeapis/)
</Message>

### Javascript (Typescript)

To perform chat conversations with Langchain, first install `langchain` and `@langchain/openai` packages using your node package manager.

1. Use the following command to install Langchain using `npm` (`yarn` and `pnpm` are also available):
  ```bash
  npm install langchain @langchain/openai
  ```

2. Edit your `package.json` file to ensure it has the `"type": "module"` property:
  ```json
  {
    "type": "module",
    "dependencies": {
      "@langchain/openai": "^0.4.4",
      "langchain": "^0.3.19"
    }
  }
  ```

3. Create a `main.js` file and add the following content to it:
  ```js
  import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

  const chat = new ChatOpenAI({
      apiKey: "<API secret key>",
      model: "llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
      configuration: {
          baseURL: "https://api.scaleway.ai/v1",
      }
    });

  const response = await chat.invoke("Tell me a joke");
  console.log(response.content);
  ```

  <Message type="tip">
    Make sure to replace `<API secret key>` with your actual API secret key.
  </Message>

4. Run `main.js`:
  ```bash
  node main.js
  ```
  The model answer should display:
  ```bash
  Why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself? Because it was two-tired.
  ```

Note that other Langchain objects from OpenAI client library are also compatible, such as `OpenAI` and `OpenAIEmbeddings`.

## Continue Dev (AI coding assistance)

Continue Dev is a library that provides AI-powered coding assistance. Scaleway's Generative APIs support Continue Dev for code completion and more.

## Custom HTTP integrations

You can interact with Scaleway's Generative APIs directly using any HTTP client.

### cURL example

To use cURL with Scaleway's Generative APIs, you can use the following command:
```bash
curl https://api.scaleway.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <API secret key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is quantum computing?"}]
  }'
```
<Message type="tip">
  Make sure to replace `<API secret key>` with your actual API key.
</Message>

### Python HTTP example

To perform HTTP requests with Scaleway's Generative APIs, install the `requests` dependency:
```bash
pip install requests
```

Then, you can use the following code:
```python
import requests
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <API secret key>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
data = {
    "model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain black holes"}]
}
response = requests.post("https://api.scaleway.ai/v1/chat/completions", json=data, headers=headers)
print(response.json()["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```
