When booting an Instance lacking a public IP address and connected to a Private Network, users may encounter significant delays during the boot process.
This delay is particularly noticeable in Ubuntu Jammy, where it can extend up to 5 minutes. Other distributions may experience delays of approximately 2 minutes during boot.
The cause of this delay stems from systemd's failure to configure the public network interface, waiting for a timeout before further boot operations proceed.

To minimize boot delays, you can manually implement a bypass in the `systemd-networkd-wait-online.service`:

1. Create a directory for additional systemd service configurations:

    ```bash
    mkdir /etc/systemd/system/systemd-networkd-wait-online.service.d
    ```

2. Create a configuration file within the directory to adjust the timeout:

    ```bash
    cat >/etc/systemd/system/systemd-networkd-wait-online.service.d/wait-for-30-seconds.conf<<EOF
    [Service]
    ExecStart=
    ExecStart=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-networkd-wait-online --timeout=5 --any
    EOF
    ```
This adjustment will take effect upon the next system reboot, reducing the timeout to 5 seconds to avoid boot delays caused by network configuration.
