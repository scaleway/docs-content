## Differences between Functions, Containers and Jobs

Serverless Jobs are designed for batch computing workloads particularly large-scale and asynchronous tasks, like data processing, image rendering, or complex computations.

Choose Scaleway Serverless Jobs:

- for long running tasks and resource-intensive applications
- to handle a large number of jobs concurrently
- if you do not need to expose your service on a port
- for asychronous processing

<Message type="note">
  To run as a Serverless Job, your applications must be containerized, which offers you a lot of choice when configuring your runtime environments.

Choose Scaleway Serverless Functions:

- for stateless and short-lived workloads (< 15 minutes)
- for event-driven tasks
- for optimum performance in lightweight scenarios
- for autoscaling applications
- for for web-facing applications and web servers

<Message type="note">
  Serverless Functions can only be written in languages [available as runtimes](/serverless/functions/reference-content/functions-lifecycle/#available-runtimes)
</Message>

Choose Scaleway Serverless Containers:

- for stateless, short-lived applications (< 15 minutes)
- for event-driven tasks
- if your programming language is not supported as a Serverless Function runtime
- for autoscaling workloads

<Message type="note">
  To run as a Serverless Container, your application must be containerized, giving you a lot of flexibility to configure your runtime environments.
