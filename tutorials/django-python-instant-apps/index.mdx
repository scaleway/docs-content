This image allows you to bootstrap or test a Python application easily, in seconds.

Common packages have been installed:

- various SCM: git, mercurial, svn
- system wide dependencies of Python package `mysql-python`
  (libmysqlclient-dev, python-dev). You can then run `pip install mysql-python`.
- system wide dependencies of Python package `psycopg2` (libpq-dev,
  python-dev). You can then run `pip install psycopg2`.
- `virtualenv`, so you can isolate your development environment

A web environment is also bootstrapped so you can deploy your web application easily.

To understand why this image is useful, let's deploy a simple Django application.

## Creating a new Instance using the Python InstantApp

Follow the instructions for [creating an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance). When selecting the **image** to run on the Instance, ensure that you choose the **Python** image in the **InstantApps** tab.

## Running a Django web application

This image makes it easy to deploy your Django application, with nginx and uWSGI. The commands below can also be used to deploy another Python web application.

1. Install Django and create your project.

```bash
$> pip install django
$> cd /var/www
$> django-admin startproject my_django_project
```

2. Enable the nginx template to configure the virtualhost.

```bash
$> ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/my_website /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

3. Enable the uWSGI template.

```bash
$> ln -s /etc/uwsgi/apps-available/my_django_project.ini /etc/uwsgi/apps-enabled/
```

4. Restart services:

```bash
$> service uwsgi restart
$> service nginx restart
```

<Message type = "important">

It is possible to customize the nginx and uWSGI configuration templates provided!

## Installing a database

The Python InstantApp does not contain databases by default, but you can install one according to your preference:

Run the following command to install MySQL:

```bash
$> apt-get install mysql-server
```

You can also install PostgreSQL:

```bash
$> apt-get install postgresql
```
