Multifactor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to your Organization. Enforcing MFA will make it mandatory
for all users in the Organization.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

## How to enforce MFA

1. Click the name of your Organization in the top right drop-down menu. The Organization dashboard displays.
2. Go to the **Settings** tab.
3. Scroll to the **Organization Multifactor Authentication (MFA)** section.
4. Click **Enforce MFA**.
5. Type **ENFORCE** in the box.
    <Message type="important">
      Be aware that MFA will become mandatory for all users in the Organization. When you invite users to your Organization in the future, they must have set up MFA to be able to join. <br /><br />
      You can only enforce MFA if all users in your Organization have already set up MFA on their accounts.
    </Message>
6. Click **Enforce MFA**.
    If 100% of users in your Organization already have MFA enabled, a confirmation message appears on the top right corner of the screen.

    If, however, at least one of the users does not have MFA enabled, you must send them an [MFA reminder](#how-to-send-an-mfa-reminder).

    <Message type="important">
      If you invite users who are not yet a part of your Organization, they must enable MFA before joining.
    </Message>

## How to send an MFA reminder

1. Click **IAM** in the top right drop-down menu. The IAM dashboard displays.
2. Go to the **Users** tab.
3. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Send MFA reminder** next to the name of a user that has MFA disabled.
    An email is sent to the user requesting that they enable MFA.

## How to stop enforcing MFA

<Message type="requirement">
  [MFA is enforced](#how-to-enforce-mfa) in your Scaleway Organization.
</Message>

1. Click the name of your Organization in the top right drop-down menu. The Organization dashboard displays.
2. Go to the **Settings** tab.
3. Scroll to the **Organization Multifactor Authentication (MFA)** section.
4. Click **Stop enforcing MFA**.
    <Message type="requirement">
      Disabling this feature means that users in this Organization will no longer be required to have MFA set up on their accounts.
    </Message>
5. Type **STOP**.
6. Click **Stop enforcing MFA** to confirm.
    The Owner of your Organization will receive an informative email saying MFA is no longer enforced.
