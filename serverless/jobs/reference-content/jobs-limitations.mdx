This section contains usage limits that apply when using Serverless Jobs.

## Jobs resource limitations

| Resource                      | Limit      | Scope        |
|-------------------------------|------------|--------------|
| Number of job definitions max | 1000       | Organization |
| Max parallel jobs             | 400        | Organization |
| Max ephemeral storage         | 10 GB      | Job run      |
| CPU max                       | 4000 mVCPU | Job run      |
| Memory max                    | 16 GB      | Job run      |
| timeout                       | 6h         | Job run      |

## Default values for CPU and memory limits

When the job vCPU and/or memory are not provided by the client, these default values are automatically used:

| Resources | Default value  |
|-----------|----------------|
| CPU       | 1120 mvCPU     |
| Memory    | 2048 MB        |

## Architecture

Scaleway Serverless Jobs only supports `amd64` architecture for images.

For example, if you build an image using an ARM CPU, such as Apple Silicon, your image will be in the `arm64` architecture, and you will have an error message during deployment.

You must ensure that you build your image to target `amd64` architecture.
