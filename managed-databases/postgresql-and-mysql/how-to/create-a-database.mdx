Managed Database for PostgreSQL and MySQL provides fully-managed relational Database Instances, with MySQL or PostgreSQL as database engines.

The resource allows you to focus on development rather than administration or configuration. It comes with a high-availability mode, data replication, and automatic backups.

Compared to traditional database management, which requires customers to provide their infrastructure and resources to manage their databases, Managed Database for PostgreSQL and MySQL Instance offers the user access to Database Instances without setting up the hardware or configuring the software. Scaleway handles the provisioning, manages the configuration, and provides useful features, as high availability, automated backup, user management, and more.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. If you do not have a database already created, the creation page displays.
2. Click **Create Database Instance**. The creation wizard displays.
3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Select a database engine. **PostgreSQL** and **MySQL** are available.
    - Choose a region. This is the geographical location where your database will be deployed.
    - Select a database configuration. You can choose between:
        - **High Availability**: creates a secondary Instance with an up-to-date replica of the database. If the primary Instance fails, the secondary takes over requests.
        - **Standalone**: creates a standalone database provisioned on a single node.
        <Message type="important">
          You can upgrade a standalone node to High Availability after Database Instance creation, but not the opposite.
        </Message>
    - Select a node type.
    - Choose your storage type and capacity. Two types of storage are available:
        - **Basic Block Storage** - With this type, your storage is decoupled from your compute resources. You can increase your storage space without changing your node type. You can define your storage capacity by entering the desired amount in the box. The volume can be increased up to 10 TB.

        - **Block Storage Low Latency**: This storage type works like the [Basic Block Storage](#basic-block-storage), while providing lower latency and high resiliency through 5k IOPS. You can increase your volume to up to 10 TB.

        - **Local SSD Storage** - Your storage is fixed and tied to your compute resource.
        <Message type="note">
          The local storage option is only available with the first generation node types.
        </Message>
    - Select the snapshot configuration. You can either leave the default **Automatic** option to enable [autobackups](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/enable-autobackup), or select [Manual snapshots](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/manage-snapshots).
    - Add a name and set a password for your user.
    <Message type="important">
      Your username and password must adhere to specific criteria.
      - Your username can contain up to 63 characters and must start with a letter. Only alphanumeric characters are accepted.
      - Your password must have a minimum of 8 characters, and at least:
          - one uppercase character, and
          - one lowercase character, and
          - one special character, and
          - one number
    </Message>
    - Enter a name for your Instance.
4. Click **Create Database Instance** to confirm your choices and launch creation.
