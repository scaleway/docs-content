## CIDR block

A **C**lassless **I**nter-**D**omain **R**outing (CIDR) block represents a range of IP addresses. They all share the same network prefix and contain the same number of bits. An example of an IPv4 CIDR block is `172.16.16.0/22`, while an IPv6 CIDR block looks like `2002::1234:abcd:ffff:c0a8:101/64`.

An IPv4 CIDR block and an IPv6 CIDR block are created for each Scaleway Private Network. When you attach a resource (e.g. an Instance, an Elastic Metal server or a Load Balancer) to the network, [DHCP](#dhcp) will assign one IPv4 and one IPv6 address from the designated blocks to that resource. This way, each resource has a private IPv4 and IPv6 address on the Private Network.

A CIDR block has two parts: the **prefix**, which represents an IP address, and the **suffix**, which consists of a slash and a number that represents the network size (a.k.a. prefix length or subnet mask bit length). 

An IPv4 address has 32 bits, so a `/22` IPv4 CIDR block means that the first 22 bits of the prefix or IP address designate the network, and the remaining 10 bits can be used to define various hosts (resources) within the network. Therefore, the larger the suffix, the fewer IP addresses will be available for hosts on the network.

The CIDR block `172.16.16.0/22` represents 1024 IPv4 addresses ranging from `172.16.16.0` to `172.16.19.255`. IP addresses in the range can be understood as a long list following this pattern:
- `172.16.16.0`, `172.16.16.1`, `172.16.16.2` [...] `172.16.16.255`
- `172.16.17.0`, `172.16.17.1`, `172.16.17.2` [...] `172.16.17.255`
- `172.16.18.0`, `172.16.18.1`, `172.16.18.2` [...] 172.16.18.255`
- `172.16.19.0`, `172.16.19.1`, `172.16.19.2` [...] `172.16.19.255`. 

Note that the `172.16.16.0` address is reserved for the network itself, and the `172.16.19.255` is used as a broadcast address, leaving 1022 addresses to assign to hosts on the network.

IPv4 CIDR blocks will be from the following ranges typically used for private networks:

    - `192.168.0.0` - `192.168.255.255`
    - `172.16.0.0` - `172.31.255.255`
    - `10.0. 0.0` - `10.255. 255.255`

## Private Networks

Private Networks let you connect Scaleway resources across multiple AZs within the same region. Attached resources can then communicate between themselves in an isolated and secure layer 2 network, away from the public Internet.  

**D**ynamic **H**ost **C**onfiguration **P**rotocol (DHCP) is built into each Private Network, making it easy to manage the private IP addresses of your resources on the network.

Read our dedicated documentation on [creating a Private Network](/network/vpc/how-to/create-private-network/).

<Message type="note">
Previously, Private Networks at Scaleway were zoned. Only resources from within one defined AZ could be attached to each network. Now, all Private Networks are regional, and resources from any AZ within that network's region can be attached. "Old" zoned Private Networks have all been automatically migrated to become regional.

While DHCP is built into all new Private Networks, it may not be automatically activated for older Private Networks. Check our [migration](TODO) documentation for more information.

## VPC

VPC allows you to build your own **V**irtual **P**rivate **C**loud on top of Scaleway's shared public cloud. Within each VPC, you can create **regional Private Networks** and attach Scaleway resources to them, as long as the resources are in an AZ within the network's region.

One default VPC for every available region is automatically created in each Scaleway [Project](/console/my-project/concepts/#project). 

VPC currently comprises the [Private Networks](#regional-private-networks) product. Layer 2 regional Private Networks sit inside the layer 3 VPC. More features and resources will be coming to the VPC product in the future.

More features will be coming to VPC in the future.
