The environmental footprint estimation tool is currently in private beta. Sign up for the beta via [the Scaleway betas page](https://www.scaleway.com/fr/betas/#environmental-footprint-calculator). <br /><br />

This feature is currently only available for Elastic Metal servers. Refer to the [Environmental footprint calculator product integration](/environmental-footprint/additional-content/environmental-footprint-integration) index to see which products will integrate the calculator next.
