  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created an Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)
  - You have an object in [Glacier storage class](/storage/object/how-to/edit-storage-class)
</Message>

<Message type="important">
  Objects in `Glacier` can only be restored to `Standard` class.
</Message>

<Message type="tip">
  To facilitate the steps of restoration and ensure a fast restitution of your data, we recommend you use `Glacier` to store average sized files (larger than 1 MB), as opposed to several small files.

## How to restore an object

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the bucket name that contains the objects you want to restore to `STANDARD` class. The list of objects displays.
3. Click the **Restore icon** next to the object that you want to restore:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-restore-button.webp" alt="" />

    <Message type="tip">
      Alternatively, click <Icon name="more" /> > **Restore**.
    </Message>

    A pop-up appears. 

4. Enter the number of days after which the object will be transferred back to `Glacier` if you want the restoration to be temporary. 
    <Message type="important">
      Alternatively, you can click the toggle button to disable the automatic transfer of your object back to `Glacier`. This allows you to restore your object permanently. 
    </Message>

5. Click **Restore object from S3 Glacier**.
    <Message type="note">
      Your object remains available in `Standard` class for the duration you specified. It will be transferred automatically back to `Glacier` once the configured period is over.
      <br />
      If you did not select the option to send your object back to `Glacier`, your object will remain in `Standard` class permanently.
      <br />
      You can send your object back to `Glacier` class manually at any time.

## How to restore all objects in a bucket

If you have numerous files in a bucket that you would like to restore, it may be more convenient to use the command line, for example with the [s3cmd tool](/tutorials/s3cmd/). To restore all files recursively in a bucket, you can invoke this command:

```
s3cmd restore -v --recursive s3://<bucket-name>
```

To count the number of files still in `Glacier` (see [restore time](#restore-time) below, this is not immediate), you can use:

```
s3cmd ls -l --recursive s3://<bucket-name> |grep GLACIER|wc -l
```

## Restore time

The time it takes to restore an object depends on the size of the object and on if [multipart](/storage/object/concepts/#multipart-uploads) is configured. If your object is larger than 1 MB, it can take anywhere from a few minutes to 24 hours for restore to start.

For multipart objects, each part is equivalent to one object. Consequently, the more parts your object has, the longer the restore time will be.

To determine how many parts a multipart object has, you can run the following `aws-cli` command:

```
aws s3api <object-name> --bucket <bucket-name> --key b
```
For a multipart object, the `Etag` includes a suffix that indicates the number of parts of the object. In the example below, the `-<PartNumber>` is 14:

```json
{
    "AcceptRanges": "bytes",
    "LastModified": "2022-08-16T12:07:00+00:00",
    "ContentLength": 141855946,
    "ETag": "\"df1c7b0641b048c77f7177e3d22dde78-14\"",
    "VersionId": "1660651620102268",
    "ContentType": "application/x-tar",
    "Metadata": {}
}
```
Therefore, in this example, the time it takes to restore the object (that has 14 parts) is equivalent to the time it takes to restore 14 objects.
