Scaleway [Kubernetes Kapsule and Kosmos](/containers/kubernetes/concepts/#kubernetes) provide a managed environment to create, configure and run a cluster of preconfigured machines for containerized applications. This allows you to create Kubernetes clusters without the complexity of managing the infrastructure. You can create a Kapsule cluster to your required specifications, edit it after creation and delete it all when you no longer need it. You might also want to check out our how-to on [deploying an image on your cluster](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/deploy-image-from-container-registry).

## How to create a Kubernetes cluster

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The Kubernetes dashboard displays.
2. Click **Create cluster**. The first page of the cluster creation wizard displays.
3. This page concerns the configuration of your cluster. Enter the following information:
    * The **cluster type**. Select **Kubernetes Kapsule** cluster to create a cluster using exclusively Scaleway Instances.
      <Message type="note">
        This document concerns the creation and management of a **Kubernetes Kapsule** cluster. To create a Kubernetes Kosmos cluster, refer to the [Kubernetes Kosmos documentation](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-kosmos-cluster/)
      </Message>
    * The geographical **region** of the cluster.
    * The Kubernetes **version** for the cluster.
4. Configure the **regional Private Network** for the cluster. A Private Network allows your cluster to communicate in an isolated and secure network. Each cluster is autoconfigured using a /22 IP subnet.
   You can either:
    * Attach an existing regional Private Network (VPC) within the same Availability Zone from the drop-down.
    * Attach a new regional Private Network to the cluster.
    <Message type="important">
      The regional Private Network of your cluster can not be detached, and the cluster can not be moved to another Private Network after creation.
    </Message>
5. Enter the **name** for the cluster and optionally a description and tags, which can help you to organize your cluster.
6. Click **Next**. The second page of the Kapsule cluster creation wizard displays.
7. This page concerns the settings for your cluster's pool. Enter the following information:
    * The **Availability Zone** in which all your pool's nodes will be created.
    * The **node type** you require.
    * The configuration for your **node options**, including the number of nodes and whether to enable autoscale. You can also choose whether to enable auto-heal and whether to link the cluster to a placement group. Alternatively, you can leave these options at default values.
8. Click **Create cluster**. Your cluster is being deployed. Once the cluster is ready, it appears in the Clusters List.

## How to add a Scaleway pool to a Kubernetes Cluster

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the side menu. The Kubernetes dashboard displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the cluster you want to edit. Click **Add pool** in the menu. The pool configuration wizard displays.
3. This page concerns the configuration of your cluster. Enter the following information:
    - The **pool type** for the pool: Scaleway
    - The geographical **region** of the pool.
    - The **node type** for the pool.
    - If required configure the **node options** like autoscaling, autohealing, or link the pool to an existing placement group.
    - The **name** for the pool. Optionally you can assign tags to it.
4. Click **Add pool**.

## How to add a multi-cloud pool to a Kubernetes Cluster

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the side menu. The Kubernetes dashboard displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the pool you want to edit. Click **Add a pool** in the menu. The pool configuration wizard displays. 
3. Click **Add Pool**.

### How to add external nodes to a multi-cloud pool

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Kubernetes dashboard displays.
2. Click **Create cluster**. The first page of the cluster creation wizard displays. This concerns the configuration of your cluster.
3. Complete the following steps of the wizard:
    * Choose a **Cluster Type**. Select **Kubernetes Kosmos** to create a cluster, that allows you to attach a compute Instance or dedicated server from any Cloud provider to a Scaleway Kubernetes control plane.
      <Message type="note">
        This document concerns the creation and management of a **Kubernetes Kosmos** cluster. To create a Kubernetes Kapsule cluster, refer to the [Kubernetes Kapsule documentation](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/)
      </Message>
    * The geographical **region** of the cluster.
    * The Kubernetes **version** for the cluster.
    * A **name** for the cluster and optionally a description and tags.
4. Click **Create cluster** to create your cluster without any Scaleway pools.
   If you choose this option, your cluster and its control plane are deployed, and you are taken to the cluster's overview tab. Continue to [How to manage your Kubernetes Kosmos cluster](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/edit-kosmos-cluster) to find out how to add multi-cloud pools to your cluster.  
   Alternatively, click **Add and configure a pool** to add a pool of Scaleway nodes to your cluster.  In this case, the second page of the cluster creation wizard displays. This concerns the settings for your pool. 
5. Enter the following information to configure a Scaleway pool:
    * The **Availability Zone** in which all your pool's nodes will be created.
    * The **node type** you need.
    * The configuration for your **node options**, including the number of nodes and whether to enable autoscale. You can also choose whether to enable autoheal and whether to link the cluster to a placement group. Alternatively, you can leave these options at default values.
6. Click **Create cluster**. Your cluster is deployed, and you are taken to the cluster’s **Overview** tab.
  <Message type="important">
    Make sure you have:
    * An `arm64` or `amd64` server running with Ubuntu or Debian, having a public IP assigned to it
    * A Scaleway [secret key](/console/project/how-to/generate-api-key)

## How to edit a Kubernetes cluster

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the side menu. The Kubernetes dashboard displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the cluster you want to edit.

    * **Get kubeconfig**: Download the `.kubeconfig` file of the cluster
    * **Delete**: Delete the cluster

<Message type="tip">
  Click the name of the cluster you want to edit to display all available options.

## How to delete a Kubernetes cluster

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the side menu. The Kubernetes dashboard displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> to display the options menu, then click **Delete**. A cluster deletion pop-up displays. 
3. Type **DELETE** to confirm the deletion of your cluster. Tick the checkbox to automatically delete all volumes (including those with volume type “retain”) and Load Balancers whose names start with cluster ID. Validate your choice by clicking **Delete cluster**. 
    <Message type="important">
      Deleting your cluster will permanently destroy your cluster and all its associated pools and Instances. External compute resources cannot be destroyed automatically and will remain active until destroyed at the concerned cloud service provider (CSP).
