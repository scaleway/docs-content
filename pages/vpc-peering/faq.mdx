## Overview

### What is VPC Peering?

Scaleway VPC Peering is a networking service that enables two Scaleway VPCs to establish a private peering connection and route traffic between their resources.

This allows you to connect two VPCs - whether they belong to the same Scaleway Project or Organization, or different ones - for isolated traffic routing, away from the public internet.

## Getting started

### How do I peer two VPCs?

[Create a peering connector](TODO), specifying a VPC you own/manage as origin VPC, and a second VPC (that you do not necessarily own/manage) as target VPC.

An owner or manager of the target VPC must also create a peering connector. In this connector, their VPC is defined as origin, and your VPC is defined as target.

When two matching, compatible connectors are created, the VPCs are automatically peered, and you can create custom routes to route traffic between them.

## Compatibility and integration

### Can I peer VPCs from different Scaleway Projects and Organizations?

Yes, you can. A peering connection can be created between two Scaleway VPCs regardless of whether they are in the same or different Projects and Organizations. 

### Can I peer VPCs from different regions?

No. Only VPCs in the same Scaleway region can be peered.

## Access and security

### What happens if someone creates a peering connector towards my VPC, but I don't want to peer with them?



## Pricing and billing

### How much does VPC Peering cost?

## Support and troubleshooting

### Why is my VPC connector showing a status of Orphan or Conflict?
