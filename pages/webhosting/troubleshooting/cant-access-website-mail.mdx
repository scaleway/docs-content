## Problem
You are unable to access your emails or website.

### Symptoms
- The website does not load or shows an error.
- Your domain does not resolve correctly.
- You encounter connection timeouts or security warnings.

## Possible causes
- DNS records are not set up correctly.
- Your hosting service is experiencing downtime.
- Your IP address may be blocked by a firewall.

## Solution

#### Check if DNS records are set up correctly or need time to propagate
- Verify your domain's DNS records in [Scaleway’s DNS management interface](/webhosting/how-to/configure-dns-webhosting/).
- Use a DNS checker (e.g., [whatsmydns.net - DNS Propagation Checker](https://www.whatsmydns.net/)) to ensure your domain resolves correctly.
- If you have recently updated DNS settings, allow **up to 48 hours** for full propagation.

#### Check if firewall or security restrictions may prevent access
- Try accessing your website from a different network or mobile data.
- Ensure your site’s `.htaccess` or firewall rules do not unintentionally block access.

#### Check your email configuration for potential issues
- Verify your [email settings](/webhosting/how-to/manage-email-accounts/) in your Web Hosting panel (SMTP, IMAP, and POP3 configurations).
- Verify your [DNS settings](/webhosting/how-to/configure-dns-webhosting/) and ensure your domain has the correct **MX**, **SPF**, and **DKIM** records set up.
- Check if your email client or ISP is blocking outgoing SMTP connections (use **port 587 or 465** instead of port 25).

#### Check if your SSL certificate may have expired or is not installed correctly
- Check your SSL certificate status via an SSL checker tool (e.g., [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/)).
- Renew or reinstall your SSL certificate in your hosting panel.
- Ensure your domain is correctly configured for HTTPS in your website settings.

#### Check if your hosting server may be undergoing maintenance or experiencing downtime
- Check Scaleway’s [status page](https://status.scaleway.com/) for any ongoing incidents.

### Additional troubleshooting steps
- Clear your browser cache and DNS cache (`ipconfig /flushdns` on Windows or `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache` on macOS).
- Test website access using an online proxy or VPN to rule out local ISP issues.
- Check the complete documentation of [cPanel](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/) or [Plesk](https://docs.plesk.com/en-US/obsidian/) for further information.
