You can use the same virtual MAC at several failover IPs pointing on the same dedicated server.

To do this, you need to have several [failover IPs](/bare-metal/dedibox/concepts/#failover-ips) at the same server and at least one [virtual MAC](/bare-metal/network/reference-content/create-virtual-mac/) associated with one of these failover IPs.

As long as they share the same virtual MAC, your failover IPs must be moved in a group from one server to another.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net)
  - You have [created](//bare-metal/dedibox/how-to/order-dedibox) a Dedibox dedicated server
  - You have at least two [failover IPs](/bare-metal/dedibox/concepts/#failover-ips)
  - You have generated a [virtual MAC address](/bare-metal/network/reference-content/create-virtual-mac/)

1. Click **Server** > **Server list** to display a list of your physical machines. 
2. Select the server you want to configure and click **Manage**. The servers' status page displays.
3. Scroll down to the network configuration section and click **+ Info** next to the failover IP you want to configure. The advanced configuration displays.
4. Click **Add virtual MAC**. The virtual MAC configuration displays. Click **Edit** to display the virtual MAC address page. 
5. Click the cogwheel next to the failover IP address that you want to add to a multi-IP MAC address group. A pop-up menu displays. Click **Use an existing MAC address**. 
6. Select the MAC address to clone in the pop-up and click **OK** to validate. 

    The failover IP now uses the same MAC address as the origin failover IP. 

<Message type="important">
  Failover IPs sharing the same MAC address have to point to the same dedicated server. In the the failover IP configuration interface, they appear as a group and can not be moved individually.

## How to delete a failover IP from a multi-IP virtual MAC group

You can remove a failover IP from a multi-IP virtual MAC group if you do not require it any longer. 

<Message type="tip">
  When you chose to delete a virtual MAC address on an IP address that shares its virtual MAC with other IPs, only the link between this specific IP address and the MAC is deleted, the other IP addresses are not updated.
</Message>

1. Click **Server** > **Server list** to display a list of your physical machines. 
2. Select the server you want to configure and click **Manage**. The servers' status page displays.
3. Scroll down to the network configuration section and click **+ Info** next to the failover IP you want to configure. The advanced configuration displays.
4. Click **Edit**. The virtual MAC configuration displays. 
5. Click the cogwheel next to the IP address you want to configure. Then click **Delete virtual MAC addresss**. 

    The failover IP will be removed from the group. All other IPs within the group remain configured.
