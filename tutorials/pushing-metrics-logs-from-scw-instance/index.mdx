This page shows you how to push your metrics and logs from a [Scaleway Instance](/compute/instances/concepts/#instance).

<Macro id="requirements" />


- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Activated your [Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/how-to/activate-cockpit)

<Message type="important">
 - Having the default configuration on your agents might lead to more of your resourcesâ€™ metrics being sent, a high consumption and a high bill at the end of the month. Find out [how to avoid additional costs when using Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/reference-content/understanding-cockpit-usage/).
 - Sending metrics and logs for Scaleway resources or personal data using an external path is a billable feature. In addition, any data that you push yourself is billed, even if you send data from Scaleway products. Refer to the [product pricing](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/?tags=available,managedservices-observability-cockpit) for more information.

## Configure your environment

1. [Create an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance) from the **Compute** section of the Scaleway console.
2. Copy your Instance's public IP as you will need it in the next steps.
3. Open a terminal and type the following command to connect to your Instance:

            ```bash
            ssh root@<your Instance public IP>
            ```
4. Open another terminal and type the following command to clone our `tuto-cockpit-instance` repository on your local machine:

            ```bash
            git clone git@github.com:scaleway/tuto-cockpit-instance.git
            ```
5. In the same terminal as step 4, run the following command to send the `tuto-cockpit-instance` folder and its content into your Instance:

            ```bash
            scp -r tuto-cockpit-instance root@<your Instance public IP>:~/
            ```
6. Make sure the `tuto-cockpit-instance` folder is inside your Instance with the following command:

            ```bash
            ls
            ```
7. Access the `workshop` folder inside `tuto-cockpit-instance`, using the following command:

            ```bash
            cd tuto-cockpit-instance/workshop
            ```
8. Install [Golang](https://go.dev/) on your Instance using the following commands:

            ```bash
            wget https://github.com/grafana/agent/releases/download/v0.34.3/grafana-agent-0.34.3-1.amd64.deb
            sudo tar -C /usr/local/ -xzf go1.20.linux-amd64.tar.gz
            ```
9. Run the following command to set Golang in your environment:

            ```bash
            export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
            ```
10. Run the following command to install docker. Docker allows you to run the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

            ```bash
            apt install docker.io
            ```
11. Run the following command to unzip the files in the `workshop` folder:

        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install zip unzip
        ```

## Configure the Grafana agent file

1. [Generate a token](/observability/cockpit/how-to/create-token/) and select the push permissions for metrics and logs. Make sure you note down your token's secret key as you will need it in the following steps.
2.  In the same terminal where you are connected to your Instance, run the following command to download the Grafana agent:
        ```bash
        bash ./download.sh
        ```
3. Run `vim agent.yaml` to access the Grafana agent configuration file.
4. Type `i` to be able to write in the file.
5. Add your token's secret key next to `X-Token` in the `metrics` section.

6. Add your token's secret key next to `tenant_id` in the `logs` section.

7. Press `escape`, `:wq` and `Enter` to save and exit the file.
