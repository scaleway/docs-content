This page shows how to connect to your Scaleway Instance from the Scaleway console using the serial console (TTY, from **T**ele**TY**pewriter). It provides a way to connect to your Instance for debugging or if it loses its network connectivity. The serial console remains available even if you can not reach your Instance over the Internet.
