You can now migrate your Online.net Web Hosting Classic plan to Scaleway's new Web Hosting platform. This migration brings you a better experience and performance. Benefits of the migration include:

- **Enhanced control with cPanel:** cPanel provides an interface that allows for more granular control over your hosting environment. This ensures a straightforward management experience.
- **Improved performance:** Migrating to cPanel can result in noticeable performance improvements. Expect more efficient resource utilization and faster loading times for your websites and applications.
- **Up-to-date system:** cPanel's regular updates contribute to an up-to-date and secure hosting environment. This ensures that your system remains resilient in the face of evolving digital challenges.
- **A wide range of features:** Explore a range of features offered by cPanel, covering file management, security options, email functionality, and database management. These features collectively form a powerful toolkit to address diverse hosting requirements.

You can initiate the migration of your Web Hosting plan directly from your [Dedibox/Online.net console](https://console.online.net/). For further information, refer to our dedicated documentation [How to migrate an Online.net/Dedibox web hosting plan to Scaleway](/managed-services/webhosting/how-to/migrate-webhosting-plan/).

## What happens to my DNS Configuration (if the nameservers of the domain resolve to ns0.online.net)?
