## Installing the stack

In this tutorial we will install and configure a [LEMP-Stack](https://lemp.io/) using [Nginx](https://nginx.org/), a Database for [MySQL](https://www.scaleway.com/en/database/) and [PHP](https://www.php.net/).

1. Update the systems' `apt` repository information and upgrade it to make sure that the system is up-to-date and that the latest bug-fixes are installed.
    ```
    apt update && apt -y upgrade
    ```
2. Use Ubuntu's APT package manager to install Nginx. Then, restart and enable Nginx.
    ```
    apt install nginx
    systemctl restart nginx.service
    systemctl enable nginx.service
    ```
3. Install PHP.
    ```
    apt install php7.4-fpm php7.4-common php7.4-mysql php7.4-gmp php7.4-curl php7.4-intl php7.4-mbstring php7.4-soap php7.4-xmlrpc php7.4-gd php7.4-xml php7.4-cli php7.4-zip
    ```

### Creating a Database for MySQL

In this tutorial we use a Scaleway Database for MySQL. To create the database, follow [this how-to](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/create-a-database/).

<Message type="note">
  Make sure you select MySQL as your database engine.

## Downloading GLPI

1. Change the directory from root to the folder where you want to download the GLPI repository.

    In this tutorial, we use `/tmp`

    ```
    cd /tmp
    ```

    Check the most recent version of GLPI [here](https://glpi-project.org/downloads/) and replace it in the commands accordingly. In this tutorial we are using version `10.0.9`

    ```
    wget https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/releases/download/10.0.9/glpi-10.0.9.tgz
    tar -xvf glpi-10.0.9.tgz
    ```

2. Move `glpi` to the `/var/www/glpi` directory.
    ```
    mv glpi /var/www/glpi
    ```
3. Give Nginx ownership of the directory.
    ```
    chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/glpi/
    ```

## Configuring Nginx

1. Use a text editor to create a new server block VirtualHost file named `glpi` under the `/etc/nginx/sites-available` directory to include the client request settings of your web server. In this tutorial we use `nano` as a text editor.
    ```
    nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/glpi
    ```
2. Copy and paste the configuration below into the file. Replace `example.com` with your domain name and save.
    ```
    server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        server_name  example.com www.example.com;
        root   /var/www/glpi;
        index  index.php index.html index.htm;
        access_log /var/log/nginx/example.com.access.log;
        error_log /var/log/nginx/example.com.error.log;
        client_max_body_size 100M;

        autoindex off;

        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }

        location /dataroot/ {
          internal;
          alias /var/www/glpi/;
        }

    location ~ [^/].php(/|$) {
            include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
            fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
            include fastcgi_params;

        }
    }
    ```
3. Create a symbolic link to enable the server block and restart Nginx.
    ```
    ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/glpi /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
    systemctl restart nginx.service
    ```
4. Enter your server's domain name or IP address in a browser to check if GLPI can be accessed via internet.

## Installing an SSL/TLS certificate

In order to protect user credentials and other confidential information that are stored in GLPI, you can generate an SSL/TLS certificate issued by Let's Encrypt for free.

In this tutorial we use [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions).

1. Prepare the system:
    ```
    apt-get update
    apt-get install software-properties-common
    add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
    apt-get update
    ```
2. Install `certbot` using `snap`.
    ```
    apt-get install python3-certbot-nginx
    ```
3. Run `certbot`:
    ```
    certbot --nginx
    ```
4. Answer the questions when prompted by the certbot Wizard.
    **A)** Enter your e-mail address.
      ```
      Enter email address (used for urgent renewal and security notices) (Enter 'c' to
      cancel):
      ```

      ```
      Please read the Terms of Service at
      https://letsencrypt.org/documents/LE-SA-v1.2-November-15-2017.pdf. You must
      agree in order to register with the ACME server at
      https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory

      (A)gree/(C)ancel: A
      ```

    **B)** Type `A` to agree.
      ```
      Would you be willing to share your email address with the Electronic Frontier
      Foundation, a founding partner of the Let's Encrypt project and the non-profit
      organization that develops Certbot? We'd like to send you email about our work
      encrypting the web, EFF news, campaigns, and ways to support digital freedom.

      (Y)es/(N)o:
      ```

    **C)** Choose `Y`es or `N`o and input accordingly.
      The Wizard then asks which names you would like to activate HTTPS for.

    **D)** Input the corresponding number(s) and enter.
      ```
      Which names would you like to activate HTTPS for?

      Select the appropriate numbers separated by commas and/or spaces, or leave input
      blank to select all options shown (Enter 'c' to cancel): 1
      ```

    **E)** Answer the following prompt with `2` and press enter If you want to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
      ```
      Please choose whether or not to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS, removing HTTP access.

      1: No redirect - Make no further changes to the webserver configuration.
      2: Redirect - Make all requests redirect to secure HTTPS access. Choose this for
      new sites, or if you're confident your site works on HTTPS. You can undo this
      change by editing your web server's configuration.

      Cleaning up challenges

      IMPORTANT NOTES:
      - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
        /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.name/fullchain.pem
        Your key file has been saved at:
        /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.name/privkey.pem
        Your cert will expire on 2020-10-20. To obtain a new or tweaked
        version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot
        again. To non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run
        "certbot renew"
      - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
        configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
        secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
        also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
        making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
      ```
5. Take note of the paths provided as they will be required in a later step.
6. Run the command below to program an automatic renewal of your certificate.
    ```
    certbot renew --dry-run
    ```
