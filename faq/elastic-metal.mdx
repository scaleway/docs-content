## Elastic Metal General

### What are Elastic Metal servers?

An Elastic Metal server is a 100%-dedicated machine without a hypervisor, available in a cloud ecosystem. With Elastic Metal, you get full control of the resources and applications installed on the server, for maximum performance and security.

Several operating systems are available for [automatic installation from the console](/compute/elastic-metal/how-to/install-server/).

---

### What is the difference between an Elastic Metal server and a Dedicated Server (Dedibox)?

Dedibox is our historical dedicated server range, only available with monthly billing. Elastic Metal is an improved and more flexible offer, giving all the same features with flexible hourly billing, cloud integration and much more.

--- 

### What are the differences between the different Elastic Metal Server ranges?

We provide several ranges of Elastic Metal servers, each of them designed to meet the requirements of your different workloads:

- **Aluminium**: Fully dedicated Elastic Metal servers with native cloud integration, at the best price
- **Beryllium**: Powerful, balanced and reliable servers for production-grade applications
- **Lithium**: Designed with huge local storage to store, back up, and protect your data
- **Iridium**: Powerful dedicated servers designed to handle high-workload applications
- **Titanium**: Extreme dedicated performances for your heavy computing environments

## Elastic Metal Billing

### How am I billed for Elastic Metal servers?

Elastic Metal servers are available on two different billing plans: hourly or monthly. In both cases, you will receive a monthly invoice calculated at the end of each month and based on your resource consumption during the month (number of hours allocated to your account if you selected hourly billing, or the monthly price if you selected monthly billing). However, to benefit from the more advantageous monthly pricing, you will pay a one-time commitment fee equivalent to one month of subscription. To reward your long-term commitment, if you rent your Elastic Metal server for more than 12 months, we will give you Scaleway cloud credits equivalent to your commitment fee.

---

### Why is Elastic Metal offered with either monthly or hourly billing? Which should I choose? 

Choosing an hourly-billed dedicated server allows you to take advantage of both the flexibility of the public cloud and the power of a dedicated server. This can be ideal for use during periods of peak activity or one-off events.

If you need a powerful server on a frequent and continual basis, you may find that monthly billing is more suitable for you. In this case you will get a more advantageous price, while still benefiting from full integration with our public cloud to manage sporadic exceptional workloads or peak periods.

<Message type="important">
  You must [create](/compute/elastic-metal/how-to/create-server/) a new Elastic Metal server and [reinstall](/compute/elastic-metal/how-to/reinstall-server) your server to switch from monthly billing to hourly billing and vice-versa.

### What is the loyalty reward and how to use it?

You are entitled to a loyalty reward on monthly Elastic Metal servers, if your server is up and running for 12 consecutive months without termination.

The amount of the reward is a cloud service voucher in the sum of the commitment fees at the time of purchase. It can be used for all Scaleway Cloud products (except Elastic Metal servers and their associated options) and is valid for six months. You receive the reward once per physical server, and it is automatically added to your Scaleway account. [Learn more about how to get and use a loyalty reward.](/compute/elastic-metal/how-to/get-use-loyalty-reward/)

---

### Can I get a refund of the commitment fees after 12 months of keeping the server?

It is not possible to get a cash refund of the engagement fees.


## Elastic Metal Technical 

### How long does it take to boot an Elastic Metal server?

An Elastic Metal server is delivered to your account within a few minutes. You can then launch the server installation with a few simple clicks. The OS installation can take up to one hour.

---

### Which OSes can be installed on Elastic Metal servers?

We provide a range of Linux and Windows Server distributions for automatic installation from the Scaleway console.

---

### How can I reinstall an Elastic Metal server?

You can reinstall an Elastic Metal server with a few clicks at any time, [directly from your management console](/compute/elastic-metal/how-to/install-server/).

---

### How do I back up an Elastic Metal server?

Elastic Metal servers must be backed up differently to Instances which have the snapshot feature. 

The first level is to back up the your Elastic Metal server's data and configuration. This can be done by exporting to an [Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/quickstart/). You can also check out our tutorial on [backing up servers to Object Storage](/tutorials/backup-dedicated-server-s3-duplicity/) for more information.

The security and redundancy of your data can also be ensured by a cluster configuration of your application.

If you need a backup system, you can check documentation for your OS, for example  OS documentation, for example the information on snapshots [here](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lvm).

---

### Can I make changes to the BIOS settings or update the firmware of an Elastic Metal server?

Users are not permitted to modify BIOS settings of Elastic Metal servers. Any modification may lead to a malfunction of the system resulting in your data becoming unavailable. Firmware updates are managed by Scaleway. In the case of your Elastic Metal server requiring a firmware upgrade, it will be installed automatically upon reboot of the server.

---

### What happens to the data stored on the disks when I delete the server?

After deletion, all data present on the disks of an Elastic Metal server is wiped using a secure algorithm. Make sure to back up your data before deleting a server, as data cannot be recovered once the disks are wiped.

---

## Elastic Metal Networking

### How many flexible IPs can I have per Elastic Metal server?

You can have up to 64 [flexible IPs](/compute/elastic-metal/how-to/order-flexible-ip/) per Elastic Metal server.

---

### Can I move flexible IPs between my Elastic Metal servers and my Instances?

It is not currently possible to move your flexible IPs between your different Scaleway products. Each set of flexible IPs that you hold is independent, and usable only with that product. Instance flexible IPs cannot be attached to Elastic Metal servers and vice versa.

---

### Can I have IPv6 connectivity for my Elastic Metal servers?

Yes, you can order flexible IPv6 for your Elastic Metal server. These can be attributed to any of your Elastic Metal servers in the same way as flexible IPv4s. Each failover IP consists of a `/64` IPv6 subnet (18,446,744,073,709,551,616 IPv6s).

<Message type="note">
  When you configure the reverse DNS of a failover IPv6 the configuration is applied only to the first IP of each block (`XXXX:0`).
</Message>

---

### Do you provide an IPv6 address with Elastic Metal?

Elastic Metal servers are delivered with an IPv6 address (/128).

---

### Do you provide IPv6 subnets with Elastic Metal servers?

Currently, IPv6 subnets are not available for Elastic Metal offers. 

---

## Elastic Metal Windows

### Is Windows available on Elastic Metal?

Windows is available with a monthly license for Elastic Metal servers by the hour and by the month, in French only. You have to order a server from the list of Elastic Metal servers compatible with Microsoft Windows Server. Then you can choose the version of Windows Server to install in one click from our console.

---

### Why are there different versions of Microsoft Windows Server?

The Windows Server license comes in 2 versions (Standard and Datacenter), each at a different price. The availability of certain features (such as roles) will be dependent on the version you choose. You can find more information about the various features and limitations of each version on the Microsoft website.

---

### What is the price of Windows Server licenses?

Windows Server 2019 or 2022 licenses are priced on a monthly basis (no prorating, based on the calendar month) and are priced according to 3 criteria: the number of physical CPUs, the number of cores per CPU and the OS version: Standard or Datacenter. The license is billed each month, whether your Elastic Metal server itself is billed per hour or per month.

---

### Can I transfer the monthly license to another server ?

The proposed licenses are only valid on Scaleway's Elastic Metal servers, and cannot be recovered for external use.  
Each installation of Windows implies the invoicing of a new Windows license, except where Windows is being reinstalled on an Elastic Metal server where it was already previously installed. ?

---

### How can I install Hyper-V on Windows Server?

After installing the OS, you can manually enable Hyper-V roles from the Roles and Features Wizard.

---

### How many virtual machines can I install under Hyper-V?

Hyper-V is a hypervisor for hosting virtual machines. The Standard version of Microsoft Server allows you to install 2 virtual machines per host (per Elastic Metal server). The number of virtual machines (VM) on the Datacenter version is unlimited.
