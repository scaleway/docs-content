2. Click the bucket name that contains the objects you want to delete. A list of the objects stored in the bucket displays.
3. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Delete** next to the object that you want to delete.
    <Message type="important">
      Deleting a bucket will also delete all of its objects. For safety measures, the effective deletion of the bucket will start 24 hours after the deletion request. The bucket name will then be available for other customers to use.

      Once you confirm your deletion request, the bucket and all of its objects and versions will no longer be displayed in the console, nor available via the APIs. For this reason, we recommend you erase all objects and versions in the bucket before requesting the deletion, if you wish the bucket deletion to be effective immediately.

4. Click **Delete file** to if you agree with the warning and wish to continue.
    <Message type="important">
     Files bigger than 1GB might take longer to be effectively deleted.
