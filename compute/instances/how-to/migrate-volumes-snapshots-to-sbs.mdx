Scaleway is transitioning the management of Block Storage volumes and snapshots from compute teams to storage teams to enhance performance and reliability.
While the characteristics of your volumes and snapshots will remain unchanged, they will now be managed by Scaleway's new storage management system.
This guide provides the steps needed to migrate your volumes and snapshots smoothly.

## Migrating an existing Block Storage volume to Scaleway Block Storage management

<Message type="important">
    This process applies only to Block SSD (`b_ssd`) volumes.
</Message>

1. Plan the Migration by using the following `curl` command:

   ```bash
   curl --location "https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/$SCW_AVAILABILITY_ZONE/block-migration/plan" \
   --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
   --header "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
   --data "{
       \"volume_id\": \"$SCW_VOLUME_ID\"
   }"
   ```

   The response includes the volume and any snapshots created from the volume that will be migrated. It also returns a `validation_key`.

2. Confirm the Migration by using the following `curl` command:

   ```bash
   curl --location "https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/$SCW_AVAILABILITY_ZONE/block-migration/apply" \
   --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
   --header "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
   --data "{
       \"volume_id\": \"$SCW_VOLUME_ID\",
       \"validation_key\": \"$SCW_VALIDATION_KEY\"
   }"
   ```

## Migrating an existing Block Storage snapshot to Scaleway Block Storage management

<Message type="important">
    This process applies to Block SSD (`b_ssd`) or Unified (`unified`) snapshots.
</Message>

1. Plan the Migration by using the following `curl` command:

   ```bash
   curl --location "https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/$SCW_AVAILABILITY_ZONE/block-migration/plan" \
   --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
   --header "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
   --data "{
       \"snapshot_id\": \"$SCW_SNAPSHOT_ID\"
   }"
   ```

   The response includes the source volume of the snapshot and any snapshots created from this volume, including the `snapshot_id` provided by the user. It also returns a `validation_key`.

2. Confirm the Migration using the following `curl` command:

   ```bash
   curl --location "https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/$SCW_AVAILABILITY_ZONE/block-migration/apply" \
   --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
   --header "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
   --data "{
       \"snapshot_id\": \"$SCW_SNAPSHOT_ID\",
       \"validation_key\": \"$SCW_VALIDATION_KEY\"
   }"
   ```
