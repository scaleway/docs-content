Credentials give their bearer (e.g. services and platforms) access to your service. 

This page shows how to manage [credentials](/nats/concepts/#credentials) for Scaleway NATS (previously part of the Messaging and Queuing product). 

Note that the only management action available for NATS credentials is revocation. Once credentials are revoked, any user trying to use the credentials to connect to the service will be denied.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Valid [NATS credentials](/nats/how-to/create-credentials/)

## How to revoke NATS credentials

1. Click **NATS** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu.

2. Select the NATS account you want to revoke credentials for.

3. In the **Credentials** panel, click the <Icon name="delete" /> button next to the credentials you want to revoke.

    A pop-up displays, warning you that this action is irreversible and the key will no longer be able to access your service.

4. Click **Revoke credentials**.

    The credentials are revoked and you are returned to the NATS account's **Overview** page.
