## Problem

502 errors can sometimes occur on Serverless Containers during the autoscaling process when new container instances are being created.

### Cause

When a new instance is created, the Serverless health check verification is performed by default on the HTTP port. Once the port is opened, the resource is considered ready, and traffic starts being forwarded to it.

This issue typically occurs when traffic is sent too early to the newly created container before it is fully deployed.

### Possible solutions

To ensure the Serverless Container is completely ready, both in terms of the HTTP port and the software scope, it is recommended to use **custom health checks**.

You can configure [Custom health checks via the Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-containers/#path-containers-update-an-existing-container) with the `health_check` parameter. In this case, we recommend you implement a custom HTTP route on the Container that returns its readiness status.

<Message type="tip">
  A simple health check to implement is just a simple `GET` on `/` to make sure the HTTP server is properly listening.

  Example (incomplete) settings:
  ```
  health_check: {
    http: {
        path: "/"
    }
  }
  ```

    Custom healthcheck feature will be available in the Scaleway console for Q1 2025.
