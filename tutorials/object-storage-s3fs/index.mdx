In this tutorial you learn how to use [s3fs](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse) as a client for [Scaleway Object Storage](/storage/object/concepts/#object-storage). `s3fs` is a FUSE-backed file interface for S3, allowing you to mount your S3 buckets on your local Linux or macOS operating system. `s3fs` preserves the native object format for files, so they can be used with other tools including AWS CLI.

<Message type="important">
  The version of `s3fs` available for installation using the systems package manager does not support files larger than 10 GB. It is therefore recommended to compile a version, including the required corrections, from the s3fs source code repository. This tutorial will guide you through that process. Note that even with the source code compiled version of s3fs, there is a [maximum file size of 128 GB](#configuring-s3fs) when using s3fs with Scaleway Object Storage.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)

## Installing s3fs

### Dependencies

Start by installing the dependencies of `s3fs-fuse` by executing the following commands, depending on your operating system:

  - On **Debian and Ubuntu**, from the command line:
    ```bash
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    apt -y install automake autotools-dev fuse g++ git libcurl4-gnutls-dev libfuse-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev make pkg-config
    ```
  - On **CentOS**, from the command line:
    ```bash
    dnf update
    dnf install automake fuse fuse-devel gcc-c++ git libcurl-devel libxml2-devel make openssl-devel
    ```
  - On **macOS**, via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):
    ```
    brew install --cask osxfuse
    brew install autoconf automake pkg-config gnutls libgcrypt nettle git
    ```

  <Message type="note">
    On macOS, you need to add permissions to FUSE. Go to the `Settings > Security & Privacy > General` tab to allow the extension.

### s3fs-fuse

Next, download and install `s3fs-fuse` itself:

1. Download the Git repository of `s3fs-fuse`:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse.git
    ```
2. Enter the s3fs-fuse directory:
    ```bash
    cd s3fs-fuse
    ```
3. Update the `MAX_MULTIPART_CNT` value in the `fdcache_entity.cpp` file:
    - On **Linux**:

    ```bash
    sed -i 's/MAX_MULTIPART_CNT         = 10 /MAX_MULTIPART_CNT         = 1 /' src/fdcache_entity.cpp
    ```

    - On **macOS**:

    ```bash
    sed -i '' -e 's/MAX_MULTIPART_CNT         = 10 /MAX_MULTIPART_CNT         = 1 /' src/fdcache_entity.cpp
    ```
4. Run the `autogen.sh` script to generate a configuration file, configure the application, and compile it from the master branch:
    ```bash
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make
    ```
5. Run the installation of the application using the `make install` command:
    ```bash
    make install
    ```
6. Copy the application into its final destination to complete the installation:
    ```bash
    cp ~/s3fs-fuse/src/s3fs /usr/local/bin/s3fs
    ```

## Configuring s3fs

1. Execute the following commands to enter your S3 credentials (separated by a `:`) in a file `$HOME/.passwd-s3fs` and set owner-only permissions. This presumes that you have set your [API credentials](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) as environment variables named `ACCESS_KEY` and `SECRET_KEY`:
    ```
    echo $ACCESS_KEY:$SECRET_KEY > $HOME/.passwd-s3fs
    chmod 600 $HOME/.passwd-s3fs
    ```
2. Execute the following commands to create a file system from an existing bucket. Make the following replacements in the command text:
    - Replace `$SCW-BUCKET-NAME` with the name of your Object Storage bucket and `$FOLDER-TO-MOUNT` with the local folder to mount it in.
    - Replace the `endpoint` parameter with the location of your bucket (`fr-par` for Paris, `nl-ams` for Amsterdam, or `pl-waw` for Warsaw).
    - Replace `s3.fr-par.scw.cloud` with the address of the storage cluster of your bucket. It can either be `s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud` (Amsterdam, The Netherlands), `s3.fr-par.scw.cloud` (Paris, France), or `s3.pl-waw.scw.cloud` (Warsaw, Poland).
    ```
    s3fs $SCW-BUCKET-NAME $FOLDER-TO-MOUNT -o allow_other -o passwd_file=$HOME/.passwd-s3fs -o use_path_request_style -o endpoint=fr-par -o parallel_count=15 -o multipart_size=128 -o nocopyapi -o url=https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud
    ```
    <Message type="important">
    The flag `-o multipart_size=128` sets the chunk (file-part) size for [multipart uploads](/storage/object/concepts/#multipart-uploads) to 128 MB. This value allows you to upload files up to a maximum file size of 128 GB. Lower values will give you better performances. You can set it to:
      - A minimum chunk size of 5 MB, to increase performance (Maximum file size: 5 GB)
      - A maximum chunk size of 5000 MB, to increase the maximum file size (Maximum file size: 5 TB)

    <Message type="note">
      You must carry out the command as root for the `allow_other` argument to be allowed.
    </Message>
3. Add the following line to `/etc/fstab` to mount the file system on boot. Replace `s3.fr-par.scw.cloud` with the address corresponding to your bucket's geographical location:
    ```
    s3fs/#[bucket_name] /mount-point fuse _netdev,allow_other,use_path_request_style,url=https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/ 0 0
    ```

## Using Object Storage with s3fs

The file system of the mounted bucket will appear in your OS like a local file system. This means you can access the files as if they were on your hard drive.

Note that there are some limitations when using S3 as a file system:

- Random writes or appends to files require rewriting the entire file
- Metadata operations such as listing directories have poor performance due to network latency
- Eventual consistency can temporarily yield stale data
- No atomic renames of files or directories
- No coordination between multiple clients mounting the same bucket
- No hard links.
