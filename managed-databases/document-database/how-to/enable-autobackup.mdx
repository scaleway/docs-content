With the autobackup feature, the creation and management of your Database Instance backups is automated according to your backup schedule configuration.

Two types of autobackups are available at Scaleway: [backups](/managed-databases/document-database/concepts/#database-backup) and [snapshots](/managed-databases/document-database/concepts/#database-snapshot).

Backups are used when your Database Instance's storage option is a local volume. Snapshots are available for Database Instances that use Block Storage volumes.

<Message type="important">
  Although they bear the same feature name, automated snapshots and automated backups are different in their design. If you have a Database Instance using Block Storage, it is only possible to use automated snapshots as autobackup.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have a [Document Database Instance](/managed-databases/document-database/quickstart)
</Message>

<Message type="note">
  The autobackup feature is enabled by default upon the creation of an Instance. Simultaneously, a schedule policy is created. The default autobackup frequency is of 1 per day with a retention period of 7 days. You can change this in the Database Instance information page after Instance creation.
  <br /><br />
  By default, the Database Instance creation date is used as the base timestamp for the automated backups. When you change the schedule configuration, the moment you validated the new configuration becomes the new base timestamp. For example, if at 8 a.m. on a Thursday you update the autobackup frequency to 24h, your next autobackup will be created at 8 a.m. on a Friday.

    <Message type="note">
      Although autobackup is enabled by default, you can disable the feature before you create the Instance, by unchecking the box in the creation wizard. You can also disable it after the Database Instance is ready.

You can restore and export your backups by following the [how to restore backups](/managed-databases/document-database/how-to/manage-manual-backups/#how-to-restore-backups) and [how to export backups](/managed-databases/document-database/how-to/manage-manual-backups/#how-to-export-backups) procedures, respectively.

For snapshots, you can follow the [how to restore snapshots](/managed-databases/document-database/how-to/manage-snapshots/#how-to-create-a-database-instance-from-a-snapshot) procedure to create a Database Instance from a snapshot.
