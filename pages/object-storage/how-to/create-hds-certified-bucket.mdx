Under [Article L.1111-8 of the French Public Health Code](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000049571347), service providers hosting specific types of personal health information must obtain Hébergeur de Données de Santé (HDS) certification. Established by ASIP Santé, the French Digital Health Agency, HDS sets a framework to enhance the security and protection of PHI. Scaleway Object Storage enables the creation of dedicated buckets for storing health data in accordance with HDS regulatory requirements.

Refer to the [Scaleway Trust Center](https://security.scaleway.com/) for more information.

To get started with Object Storage, you must first create a bucket. Objects are gathered into buckets. Each bucket represents a space where objects are stored.

1. Click **Object Storage** on the left side menu of the console. The Object Storage dashboard displays.
2. Click **+ Create bucket**. The bucket creation page displays.
3. Select the [region](/object-storage/concepts/#region-and-availability-zone) in which to create your bucket:
    - Amsterdam, The Netherlands:
      - Region: `nl-ams`
    - Paris, France:
      - Region: `fr-par`
    - Warsaw, Poland:
      - Region: `pl-waw`
4. Check **Public** or **Private** to define the bucket visibility. The bucket visibility specifies whether everyone can see the list of objects in the bucket. It does not affect [object visibility](/object-storage/concepts/#visibility).
    <Message type="note">
      A file uploaded to a public bucket is private by default.
      A private file stored in a public bucket is not publicly accessible.
      You can change the bucket visibility at any time from the **Bucket settings** tab.
    </Message>
5. Select a use case for your bucket.
6. Under **HDS certification**, tick the **Tag this bucket as HDS-certified**.
    <Message type="note">
    By tagging this bucket, you confirm it will be used in compliance with regulations for health data storage. The HDS certification of a bucket cannot be modified after creation.
    </Message>
8. Enter a name for your bucket.
9. Optionally, you can use the cost estimator to simulate your Object Storage costs.
10. Click **Create bucket** to confirm. A list of your buckets displays, showing the newly created bucket.

You can find more information about your bucket by clicking on its name in the **Buckets** list, and then on the **Bucket settings** tab.
