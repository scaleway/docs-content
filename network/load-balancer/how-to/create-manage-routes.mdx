Routes allow you to specify, for a given frontend, which of its backends it should direct traffic to depending on the requested host. For [HTTP](/network/load-balancer/concepts/#protocol) frontends/backends, routes are based on HTTP Host headers. For [TCP](/network/load-balancer/concepts/#protocol) frontends/backends, they are based on **S**erver **N**ame **I**dentification (SNI). You can configure multiple routes on a single frontend.

## How to create routes

1. Click **Load Balancers** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. 

2. Click the Load Balancer you want to create a route for.

3. Click the **Frontends** tab.

4. Click the frontend you want to create a route on.

5. Click the **Routes** tab.

6. Click <Icon name="plus" /> **Create a route** to create a new route.

7. Enter the following information to configure the route:
    - **Source frontend**: The current frontend is pre-set.
    - **Target backend**: Select the backend to which the frontend should direct traffic to for this rule.

    If you have selected an HTTP frontend/backend pair:

    - **HTTP Host header**: Enter an HTTP Host header value to filter for (for example `www.example-domain.com`). Traffic with a matching value in its HTTP Host header will be directed to the specified target backend.

    If you have selected a TCP frontend/backend pair:

    - **SNI value**: Enter an SNI value to filter for (for example `www.example-domain.com`). Traffic with a matching SNI value will be directed to the specified target backend.

8. Click **Create a route** to finish.

  Your route is created, and you are taken to the list of all your routes for this Load Balancer.

  You can repeat this process to create as many routes as you want.

## How to edit routes

5. Click the **Routes** tab.

6. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the route you want to edit, and select **Edit** from the dropdown list.

7. Edit the backend and/or SNI/HTTP Host header value as required.

8. Click **Edit route** to finish. 

  Your route is edited and you are returned to the list of routes.

## How to delete routes

1. Click **Load Balancers** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu.
