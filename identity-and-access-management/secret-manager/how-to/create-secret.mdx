The [secret](/secret-manager/concepts/#secret) creation process slightly differs depending on whether you are using Secret Manager for the first time or not. This page explains how to create a [secret](/secret-manager/concepts/#secret) for the first time using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) and how to create a secret if you have already created resources in Secret Manager.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

          </Message>
    4. Add your secret:
        - Choose whether to add your secret manually or import it from a file.

            </Message>
        - Choose a [secret type](/secret-manager/concepts/#secret-types) and enter or upload your secret value.
    5. Create a [path](/secret-manager/concepts/#path) in which to store your secret. The path name **must be prefixed** with a slash.
    6. Enter a name for your secret and add optional tags.
    7. Optionally, click <Icon name="toggle" /> to enable [secret protection](/secret-manager/concepts/#secret-protection).
    8. Optionally, click <Icon name="toggle" /> next to **Single access** or **Time to Live** to apply an [ephemeral policy](/secret-manager/concepts/#ephemeral-policy) to your secret and its versions.

           - The ephemeral policy can only be applied to a secret at creation, and **cannot be removed** once applied.
