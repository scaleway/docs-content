## Port parameter

The port of a containerized application refers to the network port that the application inside the container listens on for incoming requests.

When you deploy a container, you must map this internal port to a port on the host machine by specifying its value at [container creation](/serverless-containers/how-to/deploy-container/) via the **Port** parameter. The value defined in this parameter will then be passed to your container during the deployment inside the `PORT` environment variable.

<Message type="note">
- Only one port can be exposed per Serverless Container.
- Your container is accessible from the internet via ports 80 and 443, regardless of the specified port. The value you set determines how the Scaleway infrastructure accesses your container.

## PORT environment variable

To allow you application to be reachable, the port declared as a parameter when [creating your Container](/serverless-containers/how-to/deploy-container/) must be the same as the port exposed by your containerized application.

We therefore recommend you use the `$PORT` variable in your application, as it will contain the port parameter value, as shown in the examples below:
