Domain names are locked by default to avoid any unsolicited outgoing transfer. If you want to transfer your domain to another registrar, you can unlock it from the Scaleway console.

## How to unlock a domain name

1. Click **Domains and DNS** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu.
2. Click the domain you want to unlock. The domain's **Overview** tab displays.

5. Click the **Copy** icon under **Transfer** in the **Domain Information** section. Your transfer authorization code is copied in your clipboard. Make sure that you give it to the registrar you want to transfer your domain to.
