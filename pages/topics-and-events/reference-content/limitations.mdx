## Usage limits

For the usage limits that apply when using Scaleway Topics and Events, see the dedicated sections on our [Organization quotas](/organizations-and-projects/additional-content/organization-quotas/) page. Limits (quotas) apply to, for example, the maximum number of topics, and consumers/subscribers, as well as to message retention duration and storage.

## VPC

Topics and Events are not currently compatible with [Scaleway VPC](/vpc/quickstart/).
