## How to connect to an Elastic Metal server from OSX (Mac) and Linux

1. Open a terminal program.
2. Enter the command below into the terminal. Make sure you replace `your_private_key` with the filename of your private key (often `id_rsa`) and `your_server_ip` with the IP address of your Elastic Metal server.
    ```bash
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_private_key root@your_server_ip
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      To find the IP address of your Elastic Metal server, log into the Scaleway console and click **Elastic Metal** in the Bare Metal section of the side menu. A list of your Elastic Metal servers and their associated IP addresses will display.
    </Message>
3. If / when prompted, allow connection to the host by typing `yes`, then press **Enter**.
    ```
    The authenticity of host 'myhost.ext (212.47.226.35)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is 4f:ba:65:cf:14:64:a7:1e:b6:07:7c:00:71:95:21:fa.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
    ```

    You are now connected to your Elastic Metal server.

## How to connect to an Elastic Metal server from Windows

To connect to your Elastic Metal server from Windows, you will need to use a small application called **PuTTY**, an SSH client.

1. Download and install PuTTY [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
2. Launch PuTTY on your computer. The main screen of the application displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-putty-main.webp" alt="" />
3. Enter your Elastic Metal server's IP address in the **Hostname** field.
    <Message type="tip">
    To find the IP address of your Elastic Metal server, log into the Scaleway console and
    click **Elastic Metal** in the Bare Metal section of the side menu. A list of your
    Elastic Metal servers and their associated IP addresses will display.

4. In the side menu, under **Connection**, navigate to the **Auth** sub-category. Do this by expanding **Connection**, then **SSH**, and finally clicking on **Auth**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-putty-ssh.webp" alt="" />
5. Click the **Browse** button and select the private key file you [generated previously](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/).
6. Click **Open** at the bottom of the screen to open a connection to the Elastic Metal server. Upon the first connection, PuTTY asks you to allow the connection to the host.
7. Click **OK** to confirm.

    The terminal window displays.
8. Enter the username `root` and press **Enter** to authenticate against the server with your SSH key.

## How to connect to a Windows server using remote access

To connect to your Elastic Metal server running Windows, you need to download a remote access tool. In this tutorial, we use [Microsoft Remote Desktop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12).

1. [Create an Elastic Metal server](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/create-server/) and choose a Windows image to run on it.
    <Message type="important">
      - Windows images are not available for the Aluminium range of Elastic Metal servers.
      - Make sure you save your password securely after creating your Elastic Metal server.
    </Message>
2. Download Microsoft Remote Desktop and launch it on your computer.
    <Message type="note">
      - [Download Microsoft Remote Desktop for OSX](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12).
      - [Download Microsoft Remote Desktop for Windows](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/microsoft-remote-desktop/9WZDNCRFJ3PS?hl=en-us&gl=us).
      - Microsoft Remote Desktop is not available with Linux. Feel free to use any other remote desktop client to initiate your connection.
    </Message>
3. Click **Add PC**. A configuration page displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-configuration-page-microsoft-remote.webp" alt="" />
4. Enter your Elastic Metal server's IP address in the **PC name** field and click **Add**.
5. Right-click your newly added PC and select **Connect**.
6. When prompted, enter `Administrateur` in the **Username** field and the password from step 1 in the **Password** field.
7. Click **Continue**. You are redirected to the Windows Server Manager.

You are now connected to your Elastic Metal server running Windows.
