Scaleway Serverless Containers used to rely on [legacy JWT authentication tokens](/serverless-containers/concepts/#jwt-token-legacy) to access private resources. This feature is now deprecated, you must therefore use Scaleway IAM to access your private containers using an [API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/).


1. [Set up IAM authentication](/serverless-containers/how-to/create-auth-token-from-console/) by creating an IAM application bearing an API key, and grant it the `ContainersPrivateAccess` via an IAM policy.

2. [Delete the existing JWT](/serverless-containers/how-to/create-auth-token-from-console/#revoking-authentication/?tab=jwt-legacy-13) for your Serverless Containers to revoke legacy authentication.

3. Pass the secret key of your IAM application's API key via the `X-Auth-Token` header to call your private container:

```bash
curl -H "X-Auth-Token: <YOUR_SECRET_KEY>" <YOUR_CONTAINER_ENDPOINT>
```
