## How to connect to your Mac mini 

### How to connect via VNC

VNC is a remote desktop-sharing protocol. It allows you to visualize the graphical screen output of a remote computer and to transfer local keyboard and mouse events to the remote computer by using a network connection.

1. Click **Apple silicon** in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu. A list of your Mac minis displays.
2. Click the Mac mini you want to connect to. Your Mac mini **Overview** displays.
3. Click the **VNC** button to launch a VNC session on your Mac mini .
    
    Your VNC client opens, and you can log in the graphical environment of macOS using the default user and your password.

    <Message type="note">
      macOS may ask you for your password once logged into the VNC session. Change the keyboard layout of macOS to your computer's local keyboard layout before entering the password. Click on U.S. keyboard in the top right corner, to display a list of all available keyboard layouts
