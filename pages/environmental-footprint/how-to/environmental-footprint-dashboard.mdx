The Scaleway Environmental Footprint dashboards help you monitor and analyze the environmental impact of your cloud resource usage. They provide clear visibility into carbon and water consumption, enabling accurate reporting and informed optimization decisions.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing actions in the target Organization
- Environmental data is available only for clients using supported Scaleway products. Data is generated daily and becomes visible the day after product activation. 
## Access the dashboards

1. In the Scaleway console, click **Environmental Footprint** under **Cost & Impact Management**.

2. An overview of your Organization’s environmental footprint for the previous and current month is displayed (carbon/water).
   The chart shows consumption by product category. Click **Water** to switch to water consumption.

## Filter consumption data

Use the filters, then click **Apply**.

   Available filters:

   * **Period** – Filter data by month. When a single month is selected, the dashboard displays daily data. When multiple months are selected, the dashboard displays monthly data.
   * **Service Category** – The type of service (for example, Compute or Storage).
    <Message type="note">
      Selecting a service category can help narrow the list of product categories, but you can choose a product category even without selecting a service category.
    </Message>
   * **Product Category** – Specific product type. Values represent the total consumption of all matching products.
   * **Project** – One or more Projects in the Organization. Leave empty to include all Projects.
   * **Locality** – Regions or Zone where resources are deployed. Leave empty to include all regions.

   Deleted Projects appear as **Deleted**.

   Click **Reset** to clear all filters.
