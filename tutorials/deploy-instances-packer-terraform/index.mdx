## Overview

[Packer](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/scaleway.html) is a tool for creating identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration file. It can build images for multiple cloud hosting platforms, including Scaleway.

[Terraform](https://terraform.io) is an open source tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.

Both applications are available for Linux, MacOS, Windows, FreeBSD and NetBSD.

## Downloading and Installing Packer

1. Download [Packer](https://www.packer.io/downloads.html) for your operating system. If you want to define a specific configuration, you can also [build the application](https://www.packer.io/intro/getting-started/install.html#compiling-from-source) from source.
2. Install the application on your computer following the instructions in the Packer [downloads page](https://www.packer.io/downloads.html).
3. Verify that the application is working properly, by opening a terminal and typing `packer --help`. You see the following output:
    ```bash
    $ packer --help
    Usage: packer [--version] [--help] <command> [<args>]

    Available commands are:
        build       build image(s) from template
        fix         fixes templates from old versions of packer
        inspect     see components of a template
        push        push a template and supporting files to a Packer build service
        validate    check that a template is valid
        version     Prints the Packer version
    ```
4. Make sure you are running at least version 1.6.3 of Packer.

## Packer Configuration Files

Packer builds images by taking a base image and installing additional software on it.

To use Packer with Scaleway, you must [generate an API Key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) from the management console.

Packer uses JSON files for the configuration.

The following are the **required** configuration parameters for a minimal configuration file:

- `project_id` (string) - The project ID to use to identify your project. It can also be specified via environment variable `SCW_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID`.

- `access_key` (string) - The Scaleway API Access Key. It can also be specified via environment variable `SCW_ACCESS_KEY`.

- `secret_key` (string) - The Scaleway API Secret Key. It can also be specified via environment variable `SCW_SECRET_KEY`.

- `image` (string) - The UUID or marketplace image label of the base image to use. This will be used to boot the server on, before launching the additional tasks. A complete list of all base image UUIDs and image labels is available at [https://api-marketplace.scaleway.com/images](https://api-marketplace.scaleway.com/images).

- `zone` (string) - The name of the zone to launch the server and where the snapshot will be available.

- `commercial_type` (string) - The name of the commercial type used to boot: RENDER-S, DEV1-S, DEV1-M, DEV1-L, GP1-L, GP1-M, GP1-S, GP1-XS, ENT1-2XL, ENT1-XL, ENT1-L, ENT1-M, ENT1-S.

A basic configuration should look like the following example:

```json
{
  "type": "scaleway",
  "project_id": "<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>",
  "access_key": "<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY>",
  "secret_key": "<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>",
  "image": "UUID OR IMAGE LABEL OF THE BASE IMAGE",
  "zone": "fr-par-1",
  "commercial_type": "DEV1-S",
  "ssh_username": "root",
  "ssh_private_key_file": "/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa"
}
```

> When you do not specify the `ssh_private_key_file`, a temporarily SSH keypair will be generated to connect to the server. This key will only allow the root user to connect the server.

There are also some optional parameters that you can use:

- `server_name` (string) - The name assigned to the server. Default packer-UUID

- `image_name` (string) - The name of the resulting image that will appear in your account. Default packer-TIMESTAMP

- `snapshot_name` (string) - The name of the resulting snapshot that will appear in your account. Default packer-TIMESTAMP

- `bootscript` (string) - The id of an existing bootscript to use when booting the server.

- `remove_volume` (bool) - Force Packer to delete volume associated with the resulting snapshot after the build. Default to false.

See the rest of the paramaters on the [Packer documentation](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/scaleway).

## Building an Image with Packer

As exemplified below, we will build an Ubuntu Image with Apache preinstalled:

1. Set your credentials as environment variable on your computer. For example in bash, you have to edit the file `~/.bashrc`, for zsh the procedure is the same, but the file to edit is `~/.zshrc`:
    ```bash
    export SCW_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
    export SCW_ACCESS_KEY=<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY>
    export SCW_SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>
    ```
2. Create and edit the file `packer.json` by putting the following content in it:
    ```json
    {
      "variables": {
        "project_id": "",
        "access_key": "",
        "secret_key": ""
      },
      "builders": [
        {
          "project_id": "{{ user `project_id` }}",
          "access_key": "{{ user `access_key` }}",
          "secret_key": "{{ user `secret_key` }}",
          "server_name": "apache",
          "image_name": "ubuntu-apache",
          "snapshot_name": "ubuntu-apache-snapshot",
          "type": "scaleway",
          "image": "<BASE_IMAGE_ID>",
          "zone": "fr-par-1",
          "commercial_type": "DEV1-S",
          "ssh_private_key_file": "/Users/myaccount/.ssh/id_rsa",
          "ssh_username": "root"
        }
      ],
      "provisioners": [
        {
          "type": "shell",
          "inline": [
            "sleep 30",
            "apt-get update",
            "apt-get -y upgrade",
            "apt-get install -y apache2"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
3. Save the file and launch packer:
    ```bash

    packer build -var "project_id=${SCW_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID}" -var="access_key=${SCW_ACCESS_KEY}" -var="secret_key=${SCW_SECRET_KEY}" packer.json
    ```

    You can also use the following file:

    ```json
    {
      "builders": [
        {
          "server_name": "apache",
          "image_name": "ubuntu-apache",
          "snapshot_name": "ubuntu-apache-snapshot",
          "type": "scaleway",
          "image": "<BASE_IMAGE_ID>",
          "zone": "fr-par-1",
          "commercial_type": "DEV1-S",
          "ssh_private_key_file": "/Users/myaccount/.ssh/id_rsa",
          "ssh_username": "root"
        }
      ],
      "provisioners": [
        {
          "type": "shell",
          "inline": [
            "sleep 30",
            "apt-get update",
            "apt-get -y upgrade",
            "apt-get install -y apache2"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    And build with this (the environment variables will be used):

    ```bash

    packer build packer.json
    ```

    You will see an output like the following:

    ```
    $ packer build scaleway.json
    scaleway output will be in this color.

    ==> scaleway: Prevalidating image name: ubuntu-apache
    ==> scaleway: Prevalidating snapshot name: ubuntu-apache-snapshot
    ==> scaleway: Using existing SSH private key
    ==> scaleway: Creating server...
    ==> scaleway: Waiting for server to become active...
    ==> scaleway: Using ssh communicator to connect: 51.15.234.151
    ==> scaleway: Waiting for SSH to become available...
    ==> scaleway: Connected to SSH!
    ==> scaleway: Provisioning with shell script: /tmp/packer-shell591856108
    ==> scaleway: Shutting down server...
    ==> scaleway: Creating snapshot: ubuntu-apache-snapshot
    ==> scaleway: Creating image: ubuntu-apache
    ==> scaleway: Destroying server...
    Build 'scaleway' finished.

    ==> Builds finished. The artifacts of successful builds are:
    --> scaleway: An image was created: 'ubuntu-apache' (ID: e6e764cf-7f46-4c13-b251-a9e47367e284) in zone 'fr-par-1' based on snapshot 'ubuntu-apache-snapshot' (ID: 7abb7315-fae6-4317-9389-8ecf3c5e8a7b)
    ```

    And the newly created image will appear in the image list in your account:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-packer-image.webp" alt="" />
4. You can now start one or a series of servers with your new image.

## Deploying Machine Images with Terraform

1. Download [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) for your operating system.
2. Set your credentials as environment variable on your computer. For example in bash, you have to edit the file `~/.bashrc`, for zsh the procedure is the same, but the file to edit is `~/.zshrc`:
    ```bash
    export SCW_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
    export SCW_ACCESS_KEY=<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY>
    export SCW_SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>
    ```
3. Create a configuration file `scaleway.tf` with the following contents:
    ```hcl
    terraform {
      required_providers {
        scaleway = {
          source = "scaleway/scaleway"
        }
      }
      required_version = ">= 0.13"
    }

    provider "scaleway" {
      zone = "fr-par-1"
    }

    resource "scaleway_instance_ip" "ip" {
    }

    data "scaleway_instance_image" "ubuntu-apache" {
      architecture = "x86_64"
      name         = "ubuntu-apache"
    }

    resource "scaleway_instance_server" "ubuntu-apache-server" {
      name  = "ubuntu-apache-server"
      ip_id = scaleway_instance_ip.ip.id
      image = data.scaleway_instance_image.ubuntu-apache.id
      type  = "DEV1-S"
      security_group_id = scaleway_instance_security_group.web.id
    }

    resource "scaleway_instance_security_group" "web" {
      name        = "http"
      description = "allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic"

      inbound_rule {
        action = "accept"
        port = 80
        ip_range = "0.0.0.0/0"
        protocol = "TCP"
      }

      inbound_rule {
        action = "accept"
        port = 443
        ip_range = "0.0.0.0/0"
        protocol = "TCP"
      }
    }
    ```
3. Initialize Terraform:
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

    You will see an output like the following:

    ```
    Initializing provider plugins...
      - Finding latest version of scaleway/scaleway...
      - Installing scaleway/scaleway v1.17.0...
      - Installed scaleway/scaleway v1.17.0 (signed by a HashiCorp partner, key ID F5BF26CADF6F9614)

    Partner and community providers are signed by their developers.
    If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here:
    https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugins/signing.html

    The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
    so the latest version was installed.

    To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
    changes, we recommend adding version constraints in a required_providers block
    in your configuration, with the constraint strings suggested below.

      * scaleway/scaleway: version = "~> 1.17.0"

    Terraform has been successfully initialized!
    ```
4. Run a **dry run** of the configuration to check it:
    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```
5. Start your server from Terraform:
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

    An output like the following will appear on the screen:

    ```
    Do you want to perform these actions?
      Terraform will perform the actions described above.
      Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

      Enter a value: yes
