## Problem
To diagnose network issues, you need to perform a series of tests.

### Symptoms
- Slow network speeds
- High packet loss
- Unstable connections

## Possible Causes
- Network congestion
- Hardware issues
- Misconfigured network settings

## Solution
Use MTR and iPerf tests to analyze network performance.

### MTR Test

An MTR test combines the functionality of `traceroute` and `ping` to examine all points between two machines.

When performing an MTR test, it is important to run it in both directions:

- From your server to your connection's IP
- From your connection to the server

#### On Linux
Ensure the `mtr` package is installed:

```
sudo apt-get install mtr
```
or
```
sudo yum install mtr
```

#### On Windows

<Message type="note">
  You need to install [WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/) on your server.
</Message>

1. Download the application from its [project page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/).
2. Extract the archive and run the executable.
3. Enter the target IP in the **Host** text box, then click **Start**. Wait one or two minutes before stopping the test. You can take a screenshot or export the results using the software's built-in functions.

#### Example of an MTR test between a Scaleway Dedibox server and `free.fr`

```
root@163-172-30-2:~# mtr --report free.fr
Start: Sun May  1 16:23:57 2016
HOST: 163-172-30-2                Loss%   Snt   Last   Avg  Best  Wrst StDev
1.|-- 163-172-30-1.rev.poneytel  0.0%    10    0.5   0.5   0.4   0.5   0.0
2.|-- 195.154.1.248              0.0%    10    1.6   1.0   0.9   1.6   0.0
3.|-- 195.154.1.254              0.0%    10    1.2   1.4   1.2   2.6   0.3
...
```

**Key metrics:**

- **Loss%**: Percentage of lost packets
- **Snt**: Number of packets sent (here, 10)
- **Last**: Latency of the last packet sent
- **Avg**: Average latency for all packets sent
- **Best**: Lowest recorded latency
- **Wrst**: Highest recorded latency

### iPerf test

An iPerf test helps measure the available bandwidth of your server.

The iPerf server `ping.online.net` offers several ports (5200-5209). If the default port is busy, specify another port using the `-p` flag, e.g., `-p 5203`.

#### On Linux

If iPerf is not installed, install it using:

```
sudo apt-get install iperf3
```
or
```
yum install iperf3
```

Run the test:

```
root@163-172-30-2:~# iperf3 -c ping.online.net -R
------------------------------------------------------------
Client connecting to ping.online.net, TCP port 5001
TCP window size: 85.0 KByte (default)
------------------------------------------------------------
[  3] local 163.172.30.2 port 36490 connected with 62.210.18.40 port 5001
[ ID] Interval       Transfer     Bandwidth
[  3]  0.0-10.0 sec  1.10 GBytes   943 Mbits/sec
```

<Message type="note">
  If your server is located in Amsterdam, use: `iperf3 -c ping-ams1.online.net -R`
</Message>

#### On Windows

1. Download iPerf [from its website](https://iperf.fr/iperf-download.php#windows).
2. Choose the latest version and download the file.
3. Extract the file.
4. Open a terminal and run:
    ```
    iperf3.exe -c ping.online.net -p 5203
    ```

**Key metrics:**

- **Interval**: Sampling interval in seconds
- **Transfer**: Amount of data transferred
- **Bandwidth**: Available bandwidth

### If your server’s network port is off

If you change your dedicated server's mode (e.g., from normal to rescue mode) during a reboot, you may see the following error in your console:

<Message type="important">
  **Your server's network port is off.**
  If you recently requested a reboot or changed to rescue/test mode, this message should disappear within a few seconds. If it persists, your network may have been blocked due to unauthorized traffic. Contact support to unlock your server.
</Message>

If this message appears repeatedly or for long periods, your server may be sending unauthorized DHCP traffic, an unassigned MAC address, excessive ARP requests, or too many requests per second.

If the message persists, try clearing your browser cache or reloading the page multiple times.

<Message type="important">
  When configuring the WAN interface on a **PfSense firewall**, disable autoconfiguration. It may cause an IPv6 packet flood, shutting down your server’s network port. If the network ports do not become available within a few minutes, contact [support](https://console.online.net/en/assistance/ticket).
