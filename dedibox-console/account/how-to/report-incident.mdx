## How is my report processed?

Once you have submitted the [report abuse form](https://abuse.scaleway.com/), you will receive an email confirming its reception by Scaleway’s abuse team.

Scaleway’s abuse team will verify the exactness of the report, that all the necessary information has been provided for the report to be processed. They will also verify whether the report indeed relates to explicitly illegal behavior or content with regard to French regulations and the evidence and information you have provided. If your report meets the above criteria, it will be validated by the abuse team and sent to Scaleway’s customer so that the necessary corrective measures can be taken.

1. You will receive updates regarding the resolution of the abuse via the email address provided in the form if you provided one.
    <Message type="note">
      Should Scaleway’s customer not respond, or should the transferred report not be processed correctly, appropriate measures will be taken by Scaleway. These measures may vary from a simple warning to termination of all services of said customer.
    </Message>
2. If your report is rejected, you will be informed of the reasons why by email.
    <Message type="note">
      * Do not repeatedly report the same practices or content, as it forces the abuse team to carry out unnecessary actions and negatively impacts their work.
      * Remain courteous when communicating with the abuse team. Abuse reports shall not contain any offensive, vulgar or threatening language.
      * If you consider that your report has been unduly rejected, you can contact Scaleway’s abuse team.
