Postman is an API client that allows you to build, test and manage APIs through a graphical interface. The platform includes features that make it easy for you to: 

  - create, import and test APIs
  - work collaboratively with other users
  - create different environments with unique variables
  - display responses in several programming languages
  - configure granular request authorization rules, using different authorization types
  - capture and monitor request data (status, time, size)

In this tutorial you will learn how to import Scaleway APIs into Postman, configure your environment variables and authentication and share your workspace with other users.

## Importing Scaleway APIs into Postman

1. Click **Workspaces** > **Create Workspace** in the top menu of the Postman interface.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-postman-create-workspace.webp" />

2. Enter a name and description and select a visibility setting for your workspace. Your workspace displays.

3. Go to the Scaleway [developers website](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/) and select a product API to download. 

  In this tutorial, we use the [Scaleway Instances API](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/instance/api/).

4. Click **Download OpenAPI**.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-postman-download-open-api.webp" />

5. Click **Collections** > **Import** in the side menu of the Postman interface.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-postman-import.webp" />

6. Drag and drop the Instances Open API `yml` file into into the indicated space to upload. 

7. Click **Import** to conclude. 
  
  The Instances API displays under the **Collections** tab in the side menu. The API is organized into files, following the different request categories (including servers, images, placement groups, IPs).

## Setting up an environment

Postman environments are sets of key/value pairs. They are spaces in which you can store your authentication information to use as variables with your collections. 

In this section, we show you how to create an environment with environment variables for a Scaleway project.

1. Click **Create Environment**. 

2. Enter a name for your environment. 

3. Configure your variables, as such:

    - **VARIABLE** - enter the key for your variable.
    - **TYPE** - select between default, which will be visible in plaintext, and secret, will mask the values on the screen.
    - **INTIAL VALUE** - this is the value shown to other users when you share the variable in a collection, environment or globals.
    - **CURRENT VALUE** - this is the value used when you send a request.

  You can add your project ID, and the access key and secret key for your project. We recommend you set your project's secret key as **secret** to increase security.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-postman-add-variables.webp" />

4. Click **Save** to do so.

## Setting up authorization 

You can set up authorization at the collection, request category and/or request level. In this tutorial, we will set the authorization at the collection level and configure the requests to inherit the setting from parent. 

1. Go to the **Collections** tab.

2. Click on the Instance API collection. The **Authorization** tab displays by default.

  <Lightbox src="scalway-postman-authorization-display.webp" />

3. Select your environment in the top right menu. 

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-postman-select-environment.webp" />

4. Select **API Key** as the authorization type.

5. Enter the following values:

    - Key: `X-Auth-Token`
    - Value: `{{SCW_SECRET_KEY}}` - this is the variable you set up in your environment.
    - Add to: `Header`

6. Click **Save**.

7. Go to your request of choice. 

8. Click the **Authorization** tab.

9. Select **Inherit auth from parent** as the authorization type. 

## Running a request

In this tutorial, we will create an Instance through an API request operated with Postman.

1. Go to the **Collections** tab of the Postman interface.

2. Click the **Create a server** request under **Instance API** > `/instance/v1/zones/{zone}/servers/`.

3. Go to the **Body** tab of the request. 

4. Edit the `{zone}` variable in the endpoint. In this tutorial we will create our Instance in `fr-par-1`. 

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-postman-endpoint.webp" />

  <Message type="tip">

  If you always create resources in the same region, you can [set up a variable](/tutorials/postman-api/#setting-up-an-environment) for the zone in your environment.

  </Message> 

5. Edit the parameters in the request with your preferences following the example below. In this tutorial we will create a GP1-M instance with the default local volume. 

  <Message type="note">

    - For more information on how to fill out the parameters, refer to the [Scaleway Developers website](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/instance/api/#post-7482b1).
    - To find the image UUID, [follow this procedure](/faq/instances/#what-is-a-marketplace-image).

  ```json
  {
  "name": "my-new-instance",
  "commercial_type": "DEV1-S",
  "image": "881d7a33-4cfa-4046-b5cf-c33cb9c62fb6",
  "enable_ipv6": false,
  "boot_type": "local",
  "project": "697ef834-9bd0-4181-ae29-b0bcd0e574ae"
  }
  ```
6. Click **Send**.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-postman-response.webp" />

You can **Save** to make sure your configuration is stored for future use.

## Going further

Postman also has a Command Line Interface (CLI) called `newman` that you can use to run your collections. Find out more about newman in the [README](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman).
