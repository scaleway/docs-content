## How to reinstall a Dedibox dedicated server

You can reinstall the operating system running on your Dedibox at any time. This can be useful if you want to have a fresh installation after modifying configurations for testing purposes, or if you want to switch to another distribution.

<Message type="important">
  When reinstalling your Dedibox, all data stored on the servers' hard disk drives is deleted. Make sure to have a backup of your data before reinstalling.

1. Click **Dedibox** in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu.
2. Choose the Dedibox server you want to reinstall by clicking on its name.
3. On the server's dashboard, scroll down to **Reinstall Dedibox Server**. Then click **Reinstall Dedibox server** to launch the OS installation wizard.
4. Select the type and version of the operating system you want to install.
    <Message type="tip">
      For more information about OS types, refer to the [dedicated servers concepts page](/bare-metal/dedibox/concepts/#os-type).
    </Message>
5. Personalize the following [partitioning](/bare-metal/dedibox/concepts/#partitioning) parameters:
    - the file system (ext4, ext3, ext2, xfs, reiserfs, nfts, swap)
    - the mount point of the partition
    - the partition size
    - the software raid (RAID 0/1/5)

    <Message type="note">
      When you start a CentOS installation with custom partitioning, you need to keep about 5 GB of unallocated disk space to prevent the automatic installation system from crashing.
    </Message>
6. Configure the system parameters. You can edit parameters such as the name of the server, and add a username, password, and SSH key.
    <Message type="note">
      To connect to your server via SSH, it is recommended that you [create and upload your SSH key](/dedibox-console/account/how-to/upload-an-ssh-key/) at this stage so that it can be transferred to your server during installation.
    </Message>
7. Tick the checkbox to confirm that your server can be shut down in case of abuse. Then click **Reinstall Dedibox server**.

    The installation of your Dedibox server may take up to 20 minutes. Once completed, your server will reboot on its hard disk.

<Message type="note">
  Depending on the OS, the installation can take several minutes to complete. Certain operating systems may require additional reboots for completion. We recommend waiting 45 to 60 minutes before you connect to your server.
