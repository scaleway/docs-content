TODO: check that Redis can be attached, check whether you can attach from product screens, check what further configuration needs to be done, add info about IP config, screenshots, check wording of buttons (regional Private Network or just Private Network)

VPC is a set of products and features allowing you to build your own **V**irtual **P**rivate **C**loud on top of Scaleway's shared public cloud. Within each VPC, you can create **regional Private Networks** and attach Scaleway resources to them, as long as the resources are in an AZ within the network's region. Attached resources can then communicate between themselves in an isolated and secure network, away from the public Internet. 

Up to 250 resources can be attached to each regional Private Network, and each resource can be attached to up to 8 regional Private Networks.

The following resource types can be attached to a regional Private Network:
- Instances
- Elastic Metal servers
- Load Balancers
- Public Gateways
- Managed Databases for PostgreSQL and MySQL
- Managed Database for Redisâ„¢

## How to attach a resource to a regional Private Network

1. Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the side menu.

    A default VPC for each available region has been automatically created for you. Currently VPC is only available for the **France - Paris** region.

2. Click the **Default VPC** for the `PAR` region.

    A list of your regional Private Networks in this VPC displays.

3. Click the regional Private Network to which you want to attach resources.

    The regional Private Network's dashboard displays.

4. Click the **Attached resources** tab.

    If you already have resources attached to the regional Private Network, a list of these displays. Otherwise, you see a welcome screen.

4. Click **+Attach a resource**. The following screen displays.

5. Select the type of resource (Instance, Elastic Metal server etc.) that you want to attach. Then select the specific resource to attach. Only resources within the same region (or one of its Availability Zones) as the regional Private Network will be displayed.

6. Choose the IP configuration for this resource on the regional Private Network. Select **Dynamic** to use DHCP to assign an IP address to this resource, or **Static** to manually enter an IP address. 

5. Click **Create a Private Network** to finish. Your Private Network is created. You are taken back to the **regional Private Networks** dashboard, where your new regional Private Network is now displayed in the list.

6. Click **Attach resource** to finish.

    You are returned to the list of attached resources, where the newly-attached resource now displays.
