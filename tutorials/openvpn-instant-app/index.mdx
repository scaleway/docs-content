OpenVPN is an open-source software application that implements Virtual Private Network (VPN) techniques for creating secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote access facilities.

The OpenVPN InstantApp is a fast and simple way to protect your online privacy and surf anonymously.

OpenVPN InstantApp comes with:
  - an OpenVPN server
  - a client configuration profile to set up your client

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Instance creation page displays.
2. Click **Create an Instance**. The Instance creation wizard displays.
3. Choose the **OpenVPN** image in the **InstantApps** tab:
4. Follow the remaining steps to [create your Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/).

## Create a VPN user

1. [Connect to your Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/) via SSH. Run the `scw-ovpn status` command to check if your OpenVPN server is ready:
    ```
    root@scw-charming-haibt:~# scw-ovpn status

    Your server is done configuring !
    You can now start using it.

    Take a look at what scw-ovpn features:
        scw-ovpn
    ```
2. Create a new user with the `scw-ovpn` tool.
    ```
    root@scw-942e6e:~# scw-ovpn
    This wrapper helps you manage your openvpn server.
    Use these commands to create an user and get a link to its configuration:
    scw-ovpn create MYUSER
    scw-ovpn serve MYUSER

    If you do not want to transfer your configuration over cleartext HTTP, type this command on your own machine:
    ssh root@51.15.51.220 scw-ovpn show MYUSER > MYUSER.ovpn

    You could also copy-paste the output of:
    scw-ovpn show MYUSER

    Or even use port forwarding to tunnel your requests to the port the http server listens on when running 'scw-ovpn serve ...'.

    Choose the way you like and understand !

        scw-ovpn status
        shows the status of the initial openvpn configuration

        scw-ovpn create CLIENTNAME
        create a new certificate with name CLIENTNAME

        scw-ovpn list
        list all available and revoked clients in separate lists

        scw-ovpn revoke CLIENTNAME
        revoke the certificate for CLIENTNAME. This client will not be able to connect afterward.

        scw-ovpn show CLIENTNAME
        shows the openvpn config file for client CLIENTNAME

        scw-ovpn serve CLIENTNAME
        starts an HTTP server you can download your openvpn client configuration from

        scw-ovpn add-instance PROTOCOL PORT ID
        add an openvpn instance listenning on PORT with PROTOCOL.
        protocol must be one of udp and tcp.

        scw-ovpn del-instance ID
        removes the openvpn instance with subnet id ID

        scw-ovpn list-instances
        list all running openvpn Instances
    ```
3. Run it with the following command:
    ```
    scw-ovpn create CLIENTNAME
    ```
    It will automatically generate the configuration for the client `CLIENTNAME`.
4. Download the configuration file from your server either via SSH or by starting an HTTP server that provides an `URL` to download the files directly on your computer.
    ```
    scw-ovpn serve CLIENTNAME
    ```

    ```
    root@scw-942e6e:~# scw-ovpn serve ovpn
    You can now download the openvpn client configuration at :

    > > http://51.15.51.220:4242/69a24160-0a77-11e8-b599-5b914f6cdb17/ovpn.ovpn
    > >
    > > > Press ENTER to stop serving the config file
    > > > Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 4242 ...
    > > >
    ```
5. Download the configuration file from the `URL` displayed in the MOTD. We assume that you have already installed a VPN client.
6. Open the configuration with your VPN client.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-tunnelblick03.webp" alt="" />
7. Start a new connection using the VPN profile we just installed once the configuration is loaded.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-tunnelblick04.webp" alt="" />

You are now connected and all your traffic is routed through the OpenVPN server. Check that your public IP matches the public IP of the server to ensure your configuration is correct.
