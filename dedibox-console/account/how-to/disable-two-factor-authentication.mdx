3. Enter a security token generated by your multifactor authentication application and click **Confirm**.

Multifactor authentication is disabled now, and you can log in with your identifier and password only.

## How to restore access to your account

If you have lost both your MFA App and backup codes, regaining access to your account will be hard.
You will need to go through a manual identity verification process.

The only way to regain access to your account is to contact our support team with the following information:
  * Email address
  * Postal address
  * Two different documents proving your identity (passport or local ID card for individual accounts + certificate of incorporation for companies)
  * A phone number to contact you on
  * A copy of your last Online bill, or details about the amount charged if you do not have a copy
  * A card statement showing the Scaleway bill debit


Once you have collected all this information, send them to [document@scaleway.com](mailto:document@scaleway.com).
