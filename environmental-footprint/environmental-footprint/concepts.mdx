## DDV_DC (Datacenter Lifespan)

This value indicates the lifespan of a datacenter, if the value is not available it can be estimated. For example `DDV_DC` = 10 years.

## dU (Duration of use)

As defined by the [ADEME Product Category Rules (PCR)](https://librairie.ademe.fr/produire-autrement/6105-methodological-standard-for-the-environmental-assessment-of-datacenter-it-hosting-services-and-cloud-services.html), the dU or duration of use, is the measurement that indicates the time a device or a datacenter was used.

## Emission factor

An emission factor is a coefficient that relates the amount of CO<sub>2</sub>eq emitted to a specific activity that generates that emission.
This coefficient is used at Scaleway to estimate CO<sub>2</sub>eq emissions from various sources.

## PuissCommDC

This value indicates the proportion of a datacenter's installed power reserved for users.

## PuissEqt (Rated power)

This value indicates how much electrical power a particular device or piece of equipment consumes while it is operating. If a server requires 500 watts of power to run, then the PuissEqt for this server is 500 watts.

## mutualisation

This  factor  is  equivalent to  [PuissEqt]() and PuissDisponibleDC, which is the nominal power available for Scaleway at the datacenter. For  shared  equipment, such as management  servers  and  network  equipment  of  the  datacenter,  this  factor  is  applied.
