You can manage IAM [policies](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#policy) in an Organization if you are the [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) of that Organization, or if you have sufficient permissions (via existing policies) to do so. Management actions including editing, attaching and detaching policies to/from groups and deleting groups from the Organization.
