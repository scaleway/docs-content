This page shows you how to modify a container's privacy policy, should you wish to do so after creation.

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [deployed a container](/compute/containers/how-to/deploy-a-container/)

</Message>


1. Click **Containers** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Containers page displays.

2. Click the relevant Containers namespace. 

3. Click the name of the container whose privacy policy you want to modify.

4. Click the **Container Settings** tab.

5. In the **Privacy Policies** panel, select **Public** or **Private** as required.

<Message type="note">

  Setting a container to Private will not take care of the actual authentication, as token validation is done at runtime. For further information, refer to the [developers documentation](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/containers/api/#authentication).
