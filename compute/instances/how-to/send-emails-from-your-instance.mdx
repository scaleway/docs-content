By default, remote email ports (25, 465, 587) are blocked, and cannot be reached from our infrastructure to avoid spam. You will need to open the mail ports on your Instance to send emails from it. You can enable them from the security group configuration.

<Message type="note">
  This document concerns enabling SMTP for Instances. If you want to enable SMTP on other resources, see our documentation on [enabling SMTP on Elastic Metal servers](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/enable-smtp/) and [enabling SMTP on Public Gateways](/network/public-gateways/how-to/configure-a-public-gateway/#how-to-enable-smtp).
