A Scaleway voucher code provides you with a discount or credit to use on our services. You can receive it as part of a promotional campaign or from your account manager. To redeem a voucher, you need to [create a Scaleway account](/console/account/how-to/create-an-account/).

Voucher codes are unique and valid only for a defined period of time.
