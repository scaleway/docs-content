You can leverage our IPFS pinning service to store permanently your data on the public IPFS network. You can do it via a Content-ID (CID) or a web URL. You can [create](/storage/ipfs/api-cli/volumes-operations) and manage your volume via the [Scaleway Command Line Interface](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli).

## Scaleway Command Line Interface overview

[The Scaleway Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli) The Scaleway command line allows you to create and interact with your volumes and pins. You will be able to create volumes, manage them, add/delete content within them

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
    - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
    - You have generated your [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
    - You have downloaded and installed the [Scaleway CLI v2](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli#scaleway-cli-v2)
</Message>

## Configuring the CLI

1. Open a terminal and enter the following command, to configure the Scaleway CLI on your machine:

    `scw init`

    If you have already configured the CLI, you will see a message like the following:

    ```
    Current config is located at /path/to/config.yaml
    access_key: <YOUR ACCESS KEY>
    secret_key: <YOUR SECRET KEY>
    default_organization_id: <YOUR ORGANIZATION ID>
    default_project_id: <YOUR PROJECT ID>
    default_region: <YOUR DEFAULT REGION, eg fr-par>
    default_zone: <YOUR DEFAULT ZONE, eg fr-par-1>

    Do you want to override the current config? (Y/n):
    ```
2. Unless you want to change your configuration, you can type `n` and go directly to the [Creating a Volume](#creating-a-volume) step of this tutorial.

    If you have not yet configured the CLI, you will be guided through the configuration process via a series of questions:

    ```
    Enter a valid secret-key or an email
    ```
3. Enter either the email address for your account (you will then be asked for your password), or your [API Secret Key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/):
    ```
    To improve this tool we rely on diagnostic and usage data.
    Sending such data is optional and can be disabled at any time by running "scw config set send-telemetry=false".
    Do you want to send usage statistics and diagnostics? (Y/n):
    ```

    Type `y` or `n` and hit enter.

    ```
    To fully enjoy Scaleway CLI we recommend you install autocomplete support in your shell.
    Do you want to install autocomplete? (Y/n):
    ```
    Type `y` or `n` and hit enter.

    ```
    To enable autocomplete, scw needs to update your shell configuration.
    What type of shell are you using (default: zsh):
    ```
4. Hit enter if the default shell type is already correct for you. Otherwise, enter your shell type and hit enter.
    ```
    To enable autocomplete we need to append to /Users/yourusername/.zshrc the following lines:
    # Scaleway CLI autocomplete initialization.
    eval "$(scw autocomplete script shell=zsh)"
    Do you want to proceed with these changes? (Y/n):
    ```

    Type `y` or `n` and hit enter. This should complete the configuration process:

    ```
    Initialization completed with success.
    ```

## Create a volume

This operation allows you to create a new volume. Your pins will be attached to this volume. You can have many volumes into your project.

**Sample request**
```sh no-copy
POST /ipfs/v1alpha1/regions/fr-par/volumes HTTP/1.1
Host: agw.fr-par-2.internal.scaleway.com
X-Auth-Token: 6a55c9c4-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**CLI command**
```
scw ipfs volume create project-id=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 name=MyVolume
```

**Response**
```
ID         11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
ProjectID  00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
Region     fr-par
CountPin   0
CreatedAt  now
UpdatedAt  now
Name       MyVolume
```

## Delete a volume

This operation allows you to delete the volume mentioned in the command.

<Message type="important">
  Deleting a volume will also delete all of its associated pins.<br /><br />Once you do so, the volume and all of its pins will no longer be displayed in the console, nor available via the APIs.
</Message>

<Message type="note">
  If the operation is successful no output will be returned.
</Message>

**Delete request**
```sh no-copy

Host: agw.fr-par-2.internal.scaleway.com
X-Auth-Token: 6a55c9c4-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
