**Commitment plan for Apple silicon** is a flexible pricing option that allows you to choose between a fully flexible pay-as-you-go pricing or a long-term monthly commitment period for Apple silicon servers.
By committing to a plan, you can enjoy better rates than pay-as-you-go pricing.

The initial commitment is for one month from the server order. At the end of your initial commitment period, the commitment is automatically renewed every month on the anniversary date unless you choose to delete the machine, in which case the deletion will take effect on the anniversary date of the commitment.

It is important to note that the commitment applies only to the server. Options, such as the VPC option, remain without commitment but benefit from lower prices when used with a committed server.

1. Click [Apple silicon](https://console.scaleway.com/asaas/servers) in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu. A list of your Mac minis displays.
2. Click the Mac mini you want to configure. Your Mac mini information page displays.
3. Scroll down to the **Commitment plan** section. You can see information about your current commitment plan. Click **Manage plan**. A pop-up displays.
4. Select the commitment plan for your Mac mini. Two options are available:
    - **No commitment:** You can terminate the subscription of your Mac mini at any time. **For Mac minis with macOS, a mandatory initial 24-hour period is required by Apple's software license**. [Learn more about Apple's software license requirements (Section 3.A)](https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/macOSSequoia.pdf).
    - **Commitment:** You subscribe to a [commitment plan for Apple silicon](/apple-silicon/concepts/#commitment-plan) and benefit from a discounted monthly price based on your choice. The commitment period can be defined at the time of creation or later, but it is automatically renewed every month on the anniversary date.
