#### The Public Gateway currently supports only IPv4.

IPv6 support is planned for the future.

#### CentOS autoconfiguration does not work with multiple Private Networks.

When a CentOS Instance is attached to multiple Private Networks, which are themselves attached to a Public Gateway, routing metric priorities will not be enforced across reboot. You will have to disable routes autoconfiguration and configure them by yourself as explained in the [this document](/vpc/troubleshooting/autoconfig-not-working/) section.

#### Only Public Gateways created after 17 October 2023 are natively integrated with Scaleway's IPAM

Find out more about this in our [IPAM documentation](/public-gateways/concepts/#ipam).

#### Static NAT is not compatible with Managed Databases for PostgreSQL and MySQL

Managed Databases for PostgreSQL and MySQL are currently not compatible with the [Static NAT](/public-gateways/concepts/#nat) feature of [Scaleway Public Gateways](/public-gateways/concepts/#public-gateway).
