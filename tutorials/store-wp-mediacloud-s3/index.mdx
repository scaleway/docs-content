## Media Cloud Overview

[Media Cloud](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ilab-media-tools/) is a WordPress plugin allowing you to automatically import the media gallery of your blog to Object Storage and to upload new media files via the WordPress Media Manager directly into an Object Storage Bucket.

<Message type="important">
  Media Cloud requires the PHP extensions `xml` and `mbstring`. If they are not installed on your system you can install them from the command line using the `apt` package manager on Debian and Ubuntu based systems: `apt install php7.2-xml php7.2-mbstring` (For PHP version 7.2 - if you are using another PHP version modify the command accordingly).

5. Enter the connection credentials of your Object Storage bucket:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-mediacloud_07.webp" alt="" />

    - **Access key**: Your Scaleway [access key](/console/project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
    - **Secret key**: Your Scaleway [secret key](/console/project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
    - **Bucket**: The name of your [Object Storage Bucket](https://www.scaleway.com/docs/object-storage-feature/#Creating-a-Bucket-through-the-Scaleway-Console)
    - **Region**: Automatic
    - **Custom Endpoint**: The endpoint of your bucket, it can either be:

      Click **Next** to continue with the configuration.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-mediacloud_09.webp" alt="" />
8. The setup is complete now. Click **Advanced Settings** to exit the wizard and display the advanced settings. Normally nothing needs to be configured there, and you can go to your media gallery from there:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-mediacloud_10.webp" alt="" />
9. Upload your media files using the WordPress upload feature. They will be uploaded automatically into your Object Storage bucket.
10. Once uploaded, you will notice a small cloud icon next to each media file, indicating that it is stored in the Object Storage bucket:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-mediacloud_11.webp" alt="" />
11. To see details of each file, click it. WordPress displays details about the file, such as the bucket name, the media dimensions, and the complete storage URL:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-mediacloud_12.webp" alt="" />

All newly uploaded files are automatically stored in the Object Storage bucket, and they can be used from the Media Library like any other media when writing a blog post.
