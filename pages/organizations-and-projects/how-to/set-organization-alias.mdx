import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'

An alias is a string of characters used to identify the Organization during member login. Aliases can be used as an alternative to the Organization ID to make memorization and access easier for members.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization


<Message type="important">
  Keep in mind that:
  - An alias must contain between 2 and 32 characters
  - Aliases must be composed of lower case letters from A to Z and cannot include accents or digits
  - Each alias is unique value at Scaleway, meaning that no two Organizations can have the same alias
  - Currently, any update to your alias must be made via [support ticket](https://console.scaleway.com/support).

1. Go to the [Organization settings page](https://console.scaleway.com/settings/organization/information).
2. Click **Add** under **Organization alias** in the **Organization Information** section. A pop-up displays.
3. Enter an alias in the designated box.
4. Click **Confirm**. Your Organization alias displays in the Organization Information section.
5. Navigate to `<organization-alias>.account.scaleway.com/`, replacing `<organization-alias>` with your alias to test.

You can now share this link with members so they [can log in directly](/iam/how-to/log-in-as-a-member) to your Organization without filling out the Organization ID.
