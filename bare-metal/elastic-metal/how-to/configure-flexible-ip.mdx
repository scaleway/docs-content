Learn how to configure a [flexible IP address](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/concepts/#flexible-ip) on your Elastic Metal server. The configuration depends on the Linux distribution running on your machine. You can configure your flexible IP on machines running one of [Ubuntu Linux](#how-to-configure-a-flexible-ip-on-ubuntu-linux), [Debian Linux](#how-to-configure-a-flexible-ip-on-debian-linux) or [CentOS](#how-to-configure-a-flexible-ip-on-centos).

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An Elastic Metal server [installed](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/quickstart/#how-to-create-an-elastic-metal-server)
- A [flexible IP address](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/attach-detach-flexible-ip/) attached to your Elastic Metal server

## How to configure a flexible IP on Ubuntu Linux

Since the LTS release of Ubuntu Version 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) the recommended way to configure a flexible IP is by using [Netplan](https://netplan.io/). If you prefer a more traditional configuration, refer to the instructions for [flexible IP configuration on Debian](#how-to-configure-a-flexible-ip-on-debian-linux).

1. Log into your server using SSH with a user having super-user rights.
2. Open the file `/etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml` with superuser rights in your favorite text editor and configure the networking for your machine.
    <Message type="note">
      IP addresses in the configuration file have to be specified in CIDR
      notation. The netmask is `/24` for the principal IP of the server and `/32`
      for each flexible IP.
    </Message>
    Your configuration file should look like the following example:

    ```
    network:
      version: 2
      renderer: networkd
      ethernets:
        enp1s0f0:
            addresses: [163.172.123.123/24, 212.83.123.123/32]
            gateway4: 163.172.123.1
            nameservers:
              addresses: [ "51.159.47.28", "51.159.47.26" ] # Replace the IP of the DNS cache server with the one located in the same physical location as your machine for optimal performances (https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/console/account/reference-content/scaleway-network-information/#dns-cache-servers/) 
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      The interface name for your primary interface may be different from
      `enp1s0f0`. You can use the `ip link show` command to determine the name of
      your public internet interface.
    </Message>
3. Once the file is edited as required, save it and quit the text editor. Then apply the configuration using the following command:
    ```
    sudo netplan apply
    ```

Your server now responds on both the primary IP address and the flexible IP address.

## How to configure a flexible IP on Debian Linux

1. Log into your server using SSH with a user having super-user rights.
2. Open the file `/etc/network/interfaces` with superuser rights in your favorite text editor and configure the networking for your machine.
3. Edit the file and add the flexible IP as shown in the following example:
    ```sh
    # This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
    # and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).
    # The loopback network interface
    auto lo
    iface lo inet loopback
    # The primary network interface
    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet static
      address 195.154.123.123
      netmask 255.255.255.0
      gateway 195.154.123.1
    auto eth0:0
      iface eth0:0 inet static
        address ip_flexible
        netmask 255.255.255.255
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      The interface name of your server might be different depending on the hardware
      of the server. You can use the `ip link show` command to determine the name of
      your public internet interface.
    </Message>
4. Save the file and quit the editor.
5. Bring the interface up using the `ifup` command:
    ```sh
    ifup eth0:0
    ```

Your server now responds on both the primary IP address and the flexible IP address.

## How to configure a flexible IP on CentOS

1. Log into your server using SSH using the `root` user.
2. Copy the default network configuration file to create an alias:
    ```sh
    cp /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0:0
    ```
3. Open the file `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0:0` in your favorite text editor and modify it as in the following example:
    ```sh
    DEVICE="eth0:0"
    BOOTPROTO=static
    IPADDR="my_flexible_ip"
    NETMASK="255.255.255.255"
    ONBOOT=yes
    ```
4. Save the file, exit the text editor and run the following command to reload the network configuration:
    ```
    /etc/init.d/network restart
    ```
Your server now responds on both the primary IP address and the flexible IP address.

## How to configure a flexible IP in a virtual machine (VM)

When you install your Elastic Metal server with a virtualization solution like VMware vSphere Hypervisor (ESXi) or Proxmox you can create multiple virtual machines on the physical server.

To communicate on the Internet, each of your virtual machines needs an IP address. You can use flexible IPs to have additional IP addresses available for your virtual machines.

Configure the networking of your VM's as follows:

* IP address: Your flexible IP
* Netmask: `255.255.255.255`
* Gateway: `62.210.0.1`
* DNS resolver: `51.159.47.28` and `51.159.47.26`

<Message type="tip">
  * The gateway of all flexible IPs is `62.210.0.1`. This allows you to move your VMs between your hypervisors without changing the network configuration of the virtual machine.
  * When configuring a failover IP in a virtual machine, you must specify which route will be used by the VM. Refer to our [dedicated documentation](/dedibox-network/network/how-to/configure-network-netplan/#configuring-failover-ip-for-virtual-machines) for further information.
