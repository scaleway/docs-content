Whenever your Database Instance volume is close to reaching full capacity, your Database Instance switches to `disk_full` mode.

The Database Instance switches to `disk_full` mode when the amount of free space in the volume falls under 2% of the total volume size.

For Database Instances where 2% of the volume size is more than 2 GB, this threshold is 2 GB.

When the Database Instance switches to `disk_full` state, the default transaction mode automatically switches to `read only`. This allows your applications to still access its data, while preventing new data from being added.

This state allows you to increase your volume or [upgrade your node type](/managed-databases/mongodb/how-to/upgrade-a-database-instance/). You are also able to clear some space in your volume to increase your capacity.

  Failing to clear out some of your data, or forcing insertions while the database is in `disk_full` mode leads to downtime
