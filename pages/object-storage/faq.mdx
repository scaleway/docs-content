## What is Object Storage?

Object Storage is a service based on the Amazon S3 protocol. It allows you to store any kind of object (documents, images, videos, etc.).

Scaleway provides an integrated UI in the [console](https://console.scaleway.com) for convenience. As browsing infinite storage through the web requires some technical trade-offs, some actions are limited in the console for Object Storage:

- batch deletion is limited to 1000 objects.
- empty files are not reported as empty folders.

We provide an Amazon S3-compatible API for programmatic access or usage with any compatible software. Therefore, we recommend using dedicated tools such as `s3cmd` to manage large data sets.

## How can I benefit from the Object Storage free trial?

As a new user, you benefit from a total 750 GB of free storage across the [Standard Multi-AZ and Standard One Zone classes](/object-storage/concepts/#storage-class) for buckets in your Organization, across all [regions](/object-storage/concepts/#region-and-availability-zone), for 90 days.

750 GB is the total amount of free storage, and can be split as desired between the Standard Multi-AZ and Standard One Zone classes. For Instance, you can store 300 GB using the Standard Multi-AZ class, and 450 GB using the Standard One Zone class.

If you exceed 750 GB of combined Standard Multi-AZ and Standard One Zone storage during the free trial period, you will only be billed for the excess data.

You can activate your free trial period from the Object Storage section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com). Once it is activated, **you cannot deactivate it** to resume it at a later time.

At the end of the 90-day trial period, you will be billed for regular Object Storage pricing.

<Message type="important">
To be eligible for this offer, you must have never used the Standard Multi-AZ class before November, 30th 2023, 23:59:59.
</Message>

## How can I monitor my Object Storage consumption?

You can monitor your Object Storage metrics and logs using [Scaleway Cockpit](/cockpit/quickstart/). Cockpit is available in all [regions](/object-storage/concepts/#region-and-availability-zone) for Object Storage. Refer to our dedicated [documentation](/object-storage/how-to/monitor-consumption/) for more information.

## Is there a limitation in the bucket name?

Bucket names must be unique and comply with the following:

- Must not contain uppercase characters or underscores.
- Must not be formatted as an IP address.
- Can contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
- Can contain a set of the 63 alphabetic characters, a to z, and the 10 Arabic numerals, 0 to 9.

For buckets with a name containing a dot (.), users must use the canonical path. The subdomain form, for instance, `https://my.bucket.s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud` will not work as the SSL certificate `*.s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud` is not recursive.

In addition, when using buckets with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the SSL wildcard certificate only matches buckets that do not contain periods. Therefore, avoid using bucket names with multiple dots, as it will have an impact on accessing your bucket via HTTPS. Use **dashes** in your bucket names instead.

Bucket names are unique in our whole platform. This means **if a bucket exists already in one region, the name cannot be reused in another**.
The `“Bucket already exists”` error message is triggered when the name you intended to use for your bucket is already reserved by another user (or yourself).

<Message type="note">
  When deleting a bucket, its name becomes available again. Anybody can reuse it on a first-come, first-served principle.
</Message>

## Can I use Object Storage as a CDN?

The Object Storage product delivers content for your applications and users from a single point in the region of your choice.
Our platform is designed to deliver very high performance, up to 100 Gbit/sec per bucket per region without performance loss.

If you want to deliver your content to several geographic locations with minimal latency, you can use Scaleway's [Edge Services](/object-storage/how-to/get-started-edge-services/) directly from your bucket.

## Can I access my files via HTTPS?

Yes, you can access your files via HTTPS by creating a public link from the Scaleway console. Follow the [How to access my files via HTTPS](/object-storage/how-to/access-objects-via-https/) documentation to do so.

## Can I change HTTP headers during upload?

Yes, you can change HTTP headers with tools such as `s3cmd`, but only `Cache-control` or headers prefixed by `x-amz-meta`.

To replace metadata using the `AWS CLI`, you can use the command below:
```
aws s3 cp s3://BUCKET/ s3://BUCKET/ --recursive --acl public-read --metadata-directive REPLACE --cache-control public,max-age=31536000
```

## Can I make an object public?

Yes. All objects are private by default, but you can change their visibility to public any time. Follow the [How to manage object visibility](/object-storage/how-to/manage-object-visibility/) documentation to do so.

## How can I upload large objects?

Object Storage supports multipart upload. We recommend uploading by chunks, with a limit of 1000 chunks.

The following technical specifications apply to multipart uploads:

- 1 to 1000 parts per object
- 5 MB to 5 GB per part (except for the last one)
- Each object stores up to 5 TB

For more information, refer to the [documentation](/object-storage/api-cli/multipart-uploads/).

## How many versions of a single object can I store?

You can store up to **1,000 versions** of a single object. Once this limit is reached, Scaleway Object Storage may no longer guarantee successful creation of new versions or optimal performance.

## Does my bucket remain available after deletion?

If your bucket has been deleted from the Scaleway console, our teams may, as a last option, be able to retrieve its data the same day it is deleted (excluding weekends).
Nevertheless, this measure applies on a case-by-case basis and is not guaranteed. Contact Scaleway's Support team if you need to recover data from a deleted bucket within this time frame.

If your bucket has been deleted via the API, it is deleted instantly.

## Does Object Storage provide read-after-write consistency?

Yes. Scaleway Object Storage provides `read-after-write` consistency for `PUT` and `DELETE` requests of objects in buckets in all regions. This applies to writes of new objects as well as requests overwriting existing objects and to DELETEs.

`Read-after-write` consistency guarantees that changes are immediately visible (reading data) right after making those changes (writing data), meaning that a newly-created object will be visible immediately, without any delay.
Scaleway Object Storage stores data across multiple storage systems to achieve high availability. Any read (`GET` or `LIST`) request initiated after a successful `PUT` request will immediately return the data written by the `PUT` request.

Examples:
- You upload a new object into your bucket and request a listing of the objects in it: The new object will be visible in the list.
- You delete an existing object in your bucket and try to immediately read it. Object Storage will not return any data as the object has been deleted.

## Will closing my web browser after requesting to delete a bucket stop the deletion process?

No. After you click the button to delete a bucket in the Scaleway console, the request is processed in our backend, and does not depend on your web browser. For more information on how to delete a bucket, refer to the [dedicated documentation](/object-storage/how-to/delete-a-bucket/).

## Can I create a bucket with the same name as a previously deleted one?

Yes. If you have deleted a bucket via the Scaleway console, you can create a new one with the same name after a delay of 24 hours.

## Is there a quota limit for Object Storage?

Each Scaleway Project can use up to 250 TB of Object Storage resources. If you wish to increase your Object Storage quota, [contact Scaleway's Support team](https://console.scaleway.com/support).

### Object Storage classes

## What are the Object Storage classes offered by Scaleway?

Scaleway offers three storage classes:

- **Standard Multi-AZ**: your data is secured by distributing it across three different [Availability Zones (AZ)](/object-storage/concepts/#region-and-availability-zone). In the event of a complete data center failure in an AZ, we are still able to rebuild your data and make it accessible. This is the system we call Multi-AZ (one data center per AZ, three AZs per region). The Standard Multi-AZ class is available in [all regions](/object-storage/concepts/#region-and-availability-zone).

- **Standard One Zone**: your data is stored across three different racks in a single [Availability Zone (AZ)](/object-storage/concepts/#region-and-availability-zone). This storage class is best suited for secondary backups and recreatable data. The Standard One Zone class is available in [all regions](/object-storage/concepts/#region-and-availability-zone).

- **Glacier**: your data is archived and must be restored before being used. The Glacier storage class is only available in `fr-par` and `nl-ams` [regions](/object-storage/concepts/#region-and-availability-zone). Refer to our [Cold storage FAQ](/object-storage/faq/#cold-storage) for more information.

## What happens when Multi-AZ is launched in a region?

When Multi-AZ is launched in a region, all existing objects are converted to the Standard One Zone class, which is equivalent to the old `Standard Multi-AZ` class.

New objects created after the Multi-AZ launch can have the `Standard (Multi-AZ)`, `Standard One Zone`, or the `Glacier` class assigned.

## Will these new storage classes affect how I use my buckets?

No, any objects you upload into your buckets are added as Standard class objects by default, just as before. If you want to transfer your objects to Standard One Zone or Glacier you can do so manually or set up [lifecycle rules](/object-storage/api-cli/lifecycle-rules-api/).

## I do not want to use the new Standard Multi-AZ class. Can I still use the old class?

No, you cannot use the old `Standard Multi-AZ` class. You must use the [Standard One Zone class](/object-storage/concepts/#storage-class), which has the same behavior as the old Standard class.

## Can I create a lifecycle rule to restore objects from Glacier class to Standard One Zone?

No, because restoring an object can only be done from Glacier to Standard Multi-AZ class. Transition lifecycle rules can only be configured in the "top-down" direction.

This means that you can transfer objects from Standard Multi-AZ class to Standard One Zone and Glacier, but not from the last two to Standard Multi-AZ. You can transfer objects from Standard One Zone to Glacier, but not restore objects from Glacier to Standard One Zone. The same applies when you make server-side copies.

## Do the new storage classes impact Scaleway Glacier?

No, the rules for using Glacier class remain the same and your data is still hosted in DC4. Refer to the [Cold storage section](#cold-storage) for more information on Scaleway Glacier.

## Can I migrate my existing data to the new Standard Multi-AZ class?

Yes, you simply need to [edit the storage class](/object-storage/how-to/edit-storage-class/) of your objects.

### Cold storage

## What is the cold storage Glacier class?

The cold storage `Glacier` class of Object Storage gets its name in opposition to “hot data”. Hot data is the type that is frequently accessed. Cold storage is accessed less frequently and does not require fast access like hot data.

## How am I billed for Glacier cold storage?

<Message type="important">
  Starting from November 6th 2023, restore operations from Glacier are billed at €0.009/GB. Restore operations started before this date will not be billed.
</Message>

Scaleway Glacier is billed based on two parameters:

- Data storage: €0.00000348/GB/hour (approx. €0.002/GB/month)
- Restore to Standard Multi-AZ class: €0.009/GB

Transferring objects from `Standard Multi-AZ` or `Standard One Zone` to `Glacier` is free.

## When should I use Glacier class instead of Standard Multi-AZ class?

Scaleway Glacier is engineered for use cases that can be described as “deep archiving”. It is a durable Object Storage class designed for data archiving, for example, legal documents or long-term backups that do not require immediate access.

<Message type="important">
  We recommend you use Glacier to store average-sized files (larger than 1 MB), as opposed to several small files.
</Message>

Standard Multi-AZ class is ideal for storing frequently accessed data and files, such as static assets, on-demand content such as streaming, Content Delivery Networks (CDN) or work related documents.

## I have started the restoration of an object, why is it not available instantaneously?

An object stored in Glacier class is listed but cannot be downloaded instantly. It needs to be restored to Standard Multi-AZ class first.
We recommend that you use Glacier to archive data that you may need only once or twice within a decade.

<Message type="important">
  The time it takes to restore an object depends on the size of the object and if [multipart](/object-storage/concepts/#multipart-uploads) is configured. It can take anywhere from a few minutes to 24 hours for restore to start (for objects larger than 1 MB). 
  Unfortunately, we are unable to provide estimates of how long data retrieval takes for each use case.

  To facilitate restoration and ensure the fast restitution of your data, we recommend you use average-sized files (larger than 1 MB).
</Message>

Find out [how to restore an object from Glacier](/object-storage/how-to/restore-an-object-from-glacier/) on our dedicated page.

## Can I upload an object directly to Glacier?
 
Yes, you can select the storage class (`Standard Multi-AZ`, `Standard One Zone`, or `GLACIER`) when uploading objects using the Scaleway console. It is also possible to do so using the API. For more information, refer to our [dedicated documentation](/object-storage/how-to/edit-storage-class/).

## Why are Glacier objects stored in Paris DC4? Is it accessible from buckets in all locations?
 
Our Paris underground databunker (DC4) provides an increased layer of security by being 25 meters deep below the surface in a bunker where the Glacier storage class cluster is available.
This storage cluster is available from any bucket in Paris and Amsterdam and all objects can change the storage class to Glacier.
 
<Message type="important">
  It is not yet possible to transfer files to Glacier in Warsaw, Poland.
</Message>
 
## When are lifecycle management rules applied?
 
The expiration & transition rules are implemented every day at midnight UTC, but the actual action might take between one minute and twenty-four hours* after implementation.
 
For example, a user wants to configure a lifecycle rule that moves an object after two days to Glacier:
 
- lifecycle rules are checked every day at midnight.
- the user uploaded a file on April 6th, at 2:00 pm UTC.
- the rule is triggered on April 8th, at 11:59 pm UTC.
- the application of the rule can take up to 24 hours
⇒ the object will be transferred to Glacier no later than 11:59 pm UTC on April 9th.

<Message type="note">
  When a lifecycle rule is set for a very large amount of objects (several hundreds of thousands) simultaneously, the rule can take longer to be applied.
</Message>

## How do I encrypt my data?
 
For increased security, we recommend you encrypt your data before sending it to Scaleway Glacier.
Encryption should be done on the client side to guarantee that there is no evidence of your private key stored on the cluster.
Data can be encrypted using third-party solutions, like [GPG](https://gnupg.org/). It is possible to automate your backups, and encrypt them using a solution like [Duplicity](https://wiki.debian.org/Duplicity) or [Rclone crypt](https://rclone.org/crypt/).

## Can I manage my storage and archiving constraints related to the GDPR with Scaleway Glacier?
 
The GDPR requires that the life span of data be defined in two distinct cases:

- the deletion of data after a certain period of time
- the archiving of data that must legally be kept

Lifecycle management features meet both of these requirements by allowing you to set a timeframe beyond which your data is archived or deleted.

## What is the maximum data volume and object size supported by Scaleway Glacier?
 
There is no maximum data size, Glacier accepts an unlimited number of objects up to 5 TB each.
Large objects can be uploaded using [multipart uploads](/object-storage/api-cli/multipart-uploads/).

## Can I change the storage class of an entire bucket from Standard Multi-AZ to Glacier?
 
Yes, a best practice is to create a [lifecycle rule](/object-storage/how-to/manage-lifecycle-rules/) targeting all objects in the bucket, or using a filter with an empty prefix.
In this case, all files contained within the selected bucket will have their storage class altered automatically on the dates stipulated by you.
However, due to some restrictions on Amazon's S3 protocol, a lifecycle rule cannot be created to modify the storage class from Glacier to Standard Multi-AZ.
