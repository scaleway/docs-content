## Creating your resources

3. [Create](/compute/instances/how-to/use-security-groups/#how-to-create-a-security-group) a security group, check the **Enable SMTP ports** box, click **+ Add Instance**, and select your Instance in the drop-down.

## Configuring and logging in to your WordPress website

1. Copy your Instance's public DNS and paste it into a web browser, then hit `Enter`. The WordPress language configuration page displays.

6. Click **Activate** under the plug-in.

## Configuring the WordPress plug-in

1. Hover over **WP Mail SMTP** in the WordPress left-side menu, and click **Settings**. You are redirected to the **General** tab.
2. Click the **Launch Setup Wizard** button to configure the plug-in. You are redirected to the WP Mail SMTP welcome page.
3. Click **Let's Get Started**.
4. Choose **Other SMTP**, then click **Save and Continue**.
5. Enter `smtp.tem.scw.cloud` in the **SMTP Host** field.
6. Select **TLS** in the **Encryption** field.
7. In the **SMTP Port** enter either of the Transactional Email TLS connection ports: `465` or `2465`.

11. Enter the name you want your emails to originate from in the **From Name** field.
