[Snapshots](/managed-databases/document-database/how-to/manage-snapshots/) allow you to restore data in a new Database Instance.

When you set up [Autobackups](/managed-databases/document-database/how-to/enable-autobackup/) the automatic backups are created in Snapshot format.

You can have up to 100 snapshots per Instance and project (depending on quotas).

## How to create a Database Instance from a snapshot

You can restore the data contained in a snapshot to a Database Instance. When you do so, a new Database Instance is created and billed to your account.

1. Go to the **Snapshots** tab of your Database Instance of choice.
2. Click the <Icon name="more" /> next to the name of the snapshot.
3. Click **Create Database Instance from snapshot**. A pop-up appears.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-instance-pop-up.webp" alt="" />
4. Follow the steps:
    - Enter a name for your new Instance (1)
    - Select a node type (2)
    - Choose a configuration (3)

    <Message type="important">
      It is possible to select a different (larger or smaller) node type for your new Instance. However, the block volume size will be the same as the size of the restored snapshot. All Instance settings will be restored if you chose a node type with the same or more memory size than the initial Instance. Settings will be reset to the default if your node type has less memory.
    </Message>
5. Click **Create Instance** to confirm.

    You can see the new Instance in your Database Instances list.

## How to delete snapshots

When you delete a Database Instance, the associated snapshots are not deleted. Snapshots will be deleted after the retention period defined.

If you do not wish to wait for the snapshot to expire, you can delete it manually.

1. Go to the **Snapshots** tab of your Database Instance of choice.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the name of the snapshot.
3. Click **Delete**.
    A pop-up displays to warn you that:

    <Message type="important">
      This will permanently destroy your snapshot and all your data will be lost. This action is irreversible.
    </Message>
4. Type **DELETE** and click **Delete snapshot** if you wish to continue.
