## GitLab Kubernetes integration - Overview

[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) provides a built-in [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) Integration that allows you to build, test, deploy, and run your app at scale.

In this tutorial you will learn how to use the `gitlab` Kubernetes integration using a [Scaleway Instance](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/).
The instance will be deployed using the Scaleway `gitlab` InstantApp.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />
 
<Message type="requirement">
  - You have [created an Instance running the `gitlab` InstantApp](/tutorials/gitlab-instant-app).
  - You have [created a Kapsule cluster](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/).
  - You have downloaded the corresponding [kubeconfig](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/edit-cluster/) file and [kubectl](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/connect-cluster-kubectl/) is working
  - You have the [Helm client](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) installed

## Configuring GitLab runner using Helm charts

### Installing helm

In this tutorial we use `helm` to deploy a `gitlab` runner on a `Kapsule` cluster.
If you do not know how to install `helm`, please follow the [tutorial](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) on the official `helm` website.
On the example below we have successfully installed `helm` version 3.2.0

```
helm version
version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.2.0", GitCommit:"e11b7ce3b12db2941e90399e874513fbd24bcb71", GitTreeState:"clean", GoVersion:"go1.13.10"}
```

The `helm` charts are provided through repositories. By default `helm` 3 does not have any repository configured.
We will add the `gitlab` repository, as it provides the necessary chart to install the runner.

```
helm repo add gitlab https://charts.gitlab.io
"gitlab" has been added to your repositories
helm repo update
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Successfully got an update from the "gitlab" chart repository
Update Complete. ⎈ Happy Helming!⎈
```

### Installing GitLab runners using Helm

A `helm` chart is always shipped with a `value.yaml` file. It can be edited to customize the deployement of the application.
In this part of the tutorial we customize the `value.yaml` to fit our needs and deploy the runner on `kapsule`.

1. Get the value.yaml :
    ```
    wget https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab-runner/-/raw/main/values.yaml
    ```

    Each `gitlab` runner needs a registration token to register on the `gitlab` server.
    Retrieve the registration token from the GitLab web interface ("Admin Area" > "Runners"):

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-token.webp" alt="" />

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-token.webp" alt="" />
2. Fill the `value.yaml` with :
    - the gitlabUrl (in our case `http://212.47.237.92/`)
    - the registration token
    - enable `rbac`

    <Message type="note">
      By default, the gitlabUrl and the registration token lines are written out as a comment in the `values.yaml`file. Make sure you have deleted the `#` before saving.
    </Message>

    ```yaml
    [..]
    gitlabUrl: http://212.47.237.92/
    runnerRegistrationToken: "t7u_qjh3EFJX2-yPypkz"
    rbac:
      create: true
      [..]
      serviceAccountName: default
    ```

    We will use a dedicated [namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/).
3. To install the `gitlab` runner, create it on your `Kapsule` cluster:
    ```
    kubectl create ns gitlab-runner
    namespace/gitlab-runner created
    ```

    The default service account should use a new kubernetes [role](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#role-example), and [rolebinding](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#rolebinding-example).
4. Use the following example to create a role and role binding and associate it to the default service account in the `gitlab-runner` namespace :
    ```
    cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Role
    metadata:
      name: gitlab-runner
      namespace: gitlab-runner
    rules:
      - apiGroups: [""]
        resources: ["pods"]
        verbs: ["list", "get", "watch", "create", "delete"]
      - apiGroups: [""]
        resources: ["pods/exec"]
        verbs: ["create"]
      - apiGroups: [""]
        resources: ["pods/log"]
        verbs: ["get"]
    EOF
    kubectl create rolebinding --namespace=gitlab-runner gitlab-runner-binding --role=gitlab-runner --serviceaccount=gitlab-runner:default
    ```
5. Use the `helm` command to install the runner (note that you specify in this command line the `values.yaml` file) :
    ```
    helm install --namespace gitlab-runner  gitlab-runner -f ./values.yaml gitlab/gitlab-runner
    NAME: gitlab-runner
    LAST DEPLOYED: Wed May  6 15:48:20 2020
    NAMESPACE: gitlab-runner
    STATUS: deployed
    REVISION: 1
    TEST SUITE: None
    NOTES:
    Your GitLab Runner should now be registered against the GitLab instance reachable at: "http://212.47.237.92/"
    ```

    You can check the runner is working in the `gitlab` console ("admin area" > runners):
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-runnerok.webp" alt="" />

## Running a pipepline in the runner using a test app

To demonstrate that the runner is working, we [create a repository](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/#create-a-repository) with a "hello world" piece of code written in python.

1. Create the files using a text editor of your choice (e.g. `nano` or `vim`). In this tutorial, we use `nano`.
    ```bash
    nano helloworld.py
    ```
2. Create the content of the file as follows, save and exit:
    ```python
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```
3. Create an associated gitlab-ci file to check it is running in the runner we just deployed:
    ```bash
    nano .gitlab-ci.yaml
    ```
4. Create the content of the file as follows, save and exit:
    ```yaml
    image: ubuntu
    hello-test:
      script:
        - apt-get update && apt-get install python3
        - python3 helloworld.py
    ```
5. Push the repository and an ubuntu container is launched. At first `apt` is updated and `python3` is installed, and then the “hello, world” script is launched in the terminal.
