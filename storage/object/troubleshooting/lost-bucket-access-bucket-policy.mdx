## Problem

When [creating and applying a bucket policy](/storage/object/api-cli/create-bucket-policy/) to a bucket, you may lose access to the resources within the bucket if your bucket policy was not set properly.

[Bucket policies](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/) automatically deny actions to users who are not explicitly allowed by a [statement](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/#statement).

<Macro id="important-bucket-policy" />

## Cause

If you are not explicitly allowed access to the resources in your bucket, you may see one of the following messages:

- \[CLI\] - `An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the ListObjectsV2 operation: Access Denied`

- \[Console\] - `Failed to update bucket. Retry.`

- \[Console\] - `Failed to load data. Try refreshing the page.`

## Solution

If you have the permission to apply a bucket policy, you can also delete it. To regain access to the resources stored in your bucket, you can either:

- delete the current bucket policy using the command below. The bucket will become available to every users with [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission).
    ```
    aws s3api delete-bucket-policy --bucket <BUCKET_NAME>
    ```
- [apply a new bucket policy](/storage/object/api-cli/create-bucket-policy/) in the bucket to allow yourself (or the desired principal) to perform the desired [storage operations](/storage/object/api-cli/using-api-call-list/).

  Refer to the [bucket policies overview](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/) for more information on the different elements of a bucket policy.
