You can view your Messaging and Queuing metrics via [Scaleway Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/quickstart/). This allows you to monitor your queues/streams and messages at a glance. There are three steps to complete to view your Messaging and Queuing metrics for the first time with Cockpit:

1. Activate your Cockpit
2. Generate your Grafana credentials
3. Access the Messaging and Queuing metrics dashboard

These steps are described below.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />
 
<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) 
  - You have [activated SQS or SNS, or created a NATS account](/serverless/messaging/how-to/get-started/)
</Message>

## How to activate your Cockpit

Scaleway Cockpit is deactivated by default. To activate it, follow the procedure detailed [in the Cockpit documentation](/observability/cockpit/how-to/activate-cockpit/).

## How to generate Grafana credentials

To view your Messaging and Queuing metrics with Cockpit, you will use a Grafana dashboard which is accessible from the Scaleway console. First, you must create a user and their associated credentials (a username and password) for Grafana. This can be done directly from the Scaleway console, [by following this procedure](/observability/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/).

## How to access your Messaging and Queuing dashboard and view your metrics

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu.

2. Click the **protocol** you want to view metrics for, and navigate to the **Metrics** tab.

3. Click **Open Grafana metrics dashboard**.

4. Enter your Grafana username and password to log in.

    You are directed to the dashboard for Messaging and Queuing, where you can view all your metrics.
