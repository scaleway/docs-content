## Problem
A 'Quotas exceeded' error message appears when I try to create a resource.
### Cause
This error message appears when you cannot create additional resources. This happens because your Organization has reached the allowed number of resources. To learn more, read the [Understanding Organization Quotas](/organizations-and-projects/additional-content/organization-quotas) documentation.

### Solution
Depending on the resource you want to create, you can unlock additional quotas by [verifying your identity](/account/how-to/verify-identity/) or [contacting support](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create).
