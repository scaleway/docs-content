## How to create a Public Gateway

## How to create a Public Gateway

1. Click **Public Gateways** in the **Network** section of the side menu.
2. Click **Create Public Gateway** to launch the Public Gateway creation wizard.
3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Choose an **Availability Zone**, which is the geographical location in which your Public Gateway will be created. Note that in order to attach a Public Gateway to a Private Network, the gateway must be in an Availability Zone within the Private Network's region.
    - Choose a **Public Gateway Type**, which impacts the pricing and bandwidth of your gateway.
    - Choose an **IP**. You can choose to assign one of your existing flexible IPs to your Public Gateway, or create and assign a new public IP. 
    - Choose a **Name** for your Public Gateway, and, optionally, tags.
    - Verify the **Estimated Cost** of your Public Gateway, based on the specifications you chose.
4. Click **Create Public Gateway** to finish.

    Your Public Gateway is created and you are redirected to the **Public Gateways** dashboard, where your newly-created Public Gateway now displays.
