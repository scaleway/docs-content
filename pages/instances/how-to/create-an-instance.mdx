This page shows how to create your first Scaleway Instance. An [Instance](/instances/concepts/#instance) is a virtual machine in the cloud. Just like a physical machine, it has resources - virtualized CPU, RAM, storage etc. - which vary depending on the [Instance type](/instances/reference-content/choosing-instance-type/) you choose. After you have created your Instance you can [connect](/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/) to it and use it for a wide range of computing use cases depending on the Instance type you chose, from running small-scale tests and personal projects to hosting applications and development environments to setting up a production environment.

Select a tab below for instructions on how to create an Instance via either our [console](https://console.scaleway.com), our [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instances/), or our [CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli).

<Tabs>

  <TabsTab label="Console - Linux">

    <Requirements />

    - A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
    - [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
    - An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)

    1. Click **CPU & GPU Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The [Instance dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) displays.
    2. Click **Create Instance**, then select **Create CPU Instance**. The Instance creation wizzard displays.
    3. Select an Instance ranged based on your usage. Instance offers vary in pricing, processing power, memory, storage, and bandwidth. [Discover the best Instance type for your needs](/instances/reference-content/choosing-instance-type/).
        <Message type="tip">
          Click **Instance view** > **List** to view a list of all available Instances.
        </Message>
    4. Choose an Instance configuration from the list and click the select icon. A pop-up displays.
    5. Select the Availability Zone in which you want to deploy your Instance. Then click **Configure Instance**
    6. Complete the following steps:
        - **Name your Instance**, or leave the randomly-generated name in place. Optionally, you can add [tags](/instances/concepts/#tags) to help you organize your Instance.
        - **Choose an image** to run on your Instance. <br />
          This can be an operating system, an InstantApp, or a custom image. [Check all available Linux distributions and InstantApps](/instances/reference-content/images-and-instantapps/).
        - **Add volumes**, which are storage spaces used by your Instances. A block volume with a default name and 5,000 IOPS is automatically provided for your system volume. You can customize this volume and attach up to 16 local and/or block type volumes as needed.
          <Message type="important">
             - Ensure that the volume containing your OS image has a minimum size of 10 GB. For a GPU OS, the recommended size is 125 GB.
             - When multiple Block Storage volumes are linked to your Instance, the primary volume will host the OS and is essential for booting the Instance. If needed, the boot volume can be changed after the creation of the Instance; [see how](/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes/#how-to-change-the-boot-volume).
             - Booting from a volume that either lacks an OS or is among multiple volumes with identical operating systems can lead to inconsistent boot outcomes.
          </Message>
        - **Configure network** of the Instance.
          - Leave the checkbox ticked to assign a **Public IPv4** to the Instance. You can either allocate a new IPv4 address or select one or multiple existing IPv4s. Alternatively, uncheck the box if you do not want an IPv4.
          - Leave the checkbox ticked to assign a **Public IPv6** to the Instance. You can either allocate a new IPv6 address or select one or multiple existing IPv6s. Alternatively, uncheck the box if you do not want an IPv6.
            <Message type="note">
              You can attach up to 5 IPv4 and 5 IPv6 addresses to an Instance, which is useful for running different services or applications on the same Instance.
            </Message>
        - (Optional) Click **Cloud-init** to configure a [cloud-init configuration](/instances/concepts/#cloud-init). Otherwise, leave this option set to its default values.
          Cloud-init scripts are the standard way to automate Instance setup, such as setting up software, users, and system configurations at the first boot.
        - **Verify the [SSH keys](/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#ssh-key)** that will give you access to your Instance.
    7. Click **Review** to see a order summary. Verify the estimated cost of your Instance, based on the specifications you chose.
    8. Click **Create Instance**. The creation of your Instance begins, and you will be informed when the Instance is ready.

        Your Instance is now created, and you are redirected to the **Overview** tab. From here, you can see information including your Instance's Public IP, the SSH command to use to [connect to it](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/), and other information, settings, and actions for the Instance.

          <Message type="note">
            To use **[Block Storage Low Latency](/block-storage/) 15k**, your Instance must have at least **3 GiB/s of block bandwidth**.
            You can verify if an Instance type meets this requirement by consulting the [Scaleway Instances internet and Block Storage bandwidth overview](/instances/reference-content/instances-bandwidth-overview/) documentation.

            Alternatively, use the [Instances API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instances/#path-instance-types-list-instance-types) to check the `block_bandwidth` field at `/instance/v1/zones/{zone}/products/servers`.
            This field provides detailed information about block bandwidth for each Instance type, helping you ensure compatibility with high-performance storage.

  <TabsTab label="API">

    <Requirements />

      - A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
      - [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
      - An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
      - A valid [API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
      - Installed [`curl`](https://curl.se/) on your local machine

    <Message type="tip">
      Optionally, you may also install [`jq`](https://jqlang.org/) to prettify and parse API responses by simply appending `| jq .` to any `curl` command.
    </Message>

    1. Open a terminal and configure your environment variables with the `export` commands shown below.

        <Message type="note">
          This is an optional step that seeks to simplify your usage of the API. Ensure that you replace the variables represented by triangle brackets in the example below with your own customized values:
            - The API [access key and secret key](/iam/concepts/#api-key) that you created.
            - The Project ID of the [Project](/iam/concepts/#project) you want to create the Instance in. You can find your Project ID in the [**Settings** tab](https://console.scaleway.com/project/settings) of the relevant Project in the Scaleway console.
            - The [Availability Zone](/instances/concepts/#availability-zone) you want to create the Instance in, e.g. `fr-par-1`.
        </Message>

        ```bash
        export SCW_ACCESS_KEY="<API access key>"
        export SCW_SECRET_KEY="<API secret key>"
        export SCW_PROJECT_ID="<Project ID>"
        export SCW_DEFAULT_ZONE="<Availability Zone>"
        export PAYLOAD_FILE_PATH="/tmp/payload.json"
        ```
    2. Get the `label` of your OS of choice.

        ```
        curl --location "https://api.scaleway.com/marketplace/v2/images" \
        --header "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY"

        {
          "images": [
            {
              "id": "607b12c2-685d-45f7-905f-57bc23863834",
              "name": "Ubuntu 24.04 Noble Numbat",
              "label": "ubuntu_noble",
              ...
            },
          ],
          "total_count": 23
        }
        ```
    3. Create a file containing the **payload** of your upcoming API call. This payload specifies the configuration of the Instance you want to create. We provide an example payload below with all the required parameters, and a table of information to help you adapt it to your needs.

        ```
        cat <<EOF > "$PAYLOAD_FILE_PATH"
        {
          "name": "my-new-instance",
          "project": "$SCW_PROJECT_ID",
          "commercial_type": "GP1-S",
          "image": "ubuntu_noble",
          "volumes": {
            "0": {
              "name": "my-volume",
              "size": 300000000000,
              "volume_type": "l_ssd"
            }
          }
        }
        EOF
        ```

        | Parameter       | Description                                         | Valid values                           |
        |-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
        | name            | A name of your choice for the Instance (string)     | Any string containing only alphanumeric characters, dots, spaces and dashes, e.g. `"my-new-instance"`. |
        | project         | The Project in which the Instance should be created (string)| Any valid Scaleway Project ID (see above), e.g. `"b4bd99e0-b389-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002"` |
        | commercial-type | The commercial Instance type to create  (string)    | Any valid ID of a Scaleway commercial Instance type, e.g. `"GP1-S"`, `"PRO2-M"`. Use the [List Instance Types](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instances/#path-instance-types-list-instance-types) endpoint to get a list of all valid Instance types and their IDs.   |
        | image           | The image to install on the Instance, e.g. a particular OS (string) | Any valid Scaleway image label, e.g. `ubuntu_noble` which is the label for the Ubuntu 24.04 Noble Numbat image. |
        | volumes         | An object that specifies the storage volumes to attach to the Instance. Must respect the volume constraints of the `commercial_type` (i.e. for each type of Instance, a minimum amount of storage is required, and there is also a maximum that cannot be exceeded. Some Instance types support only Block Storage (`sbs_volume`), others also support Local Storage (`l_ssd`) ). These constraints are available at the [List Instance Types](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instances/#path-instance-types-list-instance-types) endpoint, via the `volume_constraints` parameter for each type listed in the response | A (dictionary) object with a minimum of one key (`"0"`) whose value is another object containing the parameters `"name"` (a name for the volume), `"size"` (the size for the volume, in bytes), and `"volume_type"` (`"l_ssd` or `sbs_volume`). Additional keys for additional volumes should increment by 1 each time (the second volume would have a key of `1`). Further parameters are available, and it is possible to attach existing volumes rather than creating a new one, or create a volume from a snapshot. For full details see [here](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instances/#path-volumes).  |

    4. Use the following curl command, replacing the payload with the one you specified in step 2, to create your Instance.

        ```
        curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
        "https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/{$SCW_DEFAULT_ZONE}/servers" \
        -d @"$PAYLOAD_FILE_PATH"
        ```

    Valid Instance creation results in a `201` response containing a `server` object that confirms the attributes of your Instance.

    <Message type="note">
      When creating an Instance via the API:
        - The instance comes with no public connectivity by default. You might want to create and attach an IP address to it. See [How to use flexible IP addresses with Instances](/instances/how-to/use-flexips/).
        - The Instance is in a powered off state by default. To power it on, call the [Perform action](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instances/#path-instances-perform-action) endpoint, passing it the ID of your Instance (returned in the 201 response at step 3) and `poweron` as the `action` to perform.
    </Message>

    See the [Instance API documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instances/) for full details on the Instance API. In particular, see the [Create an Instance](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instances/#path-instances-create-an-instance) call for more details of configurable parameters when creating an Instance.
