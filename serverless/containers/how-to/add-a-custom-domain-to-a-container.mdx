Each container comes with an automatically generated domain on which it is available. However, it is possible to use your own domain name to address your containers to facilitate their use.

<Macro id="requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - A running [Serverless Container](/serverless/containers/how-to/deploy-a-container-from-scaleway-container-registry/)
  - You have registered a domain name with the provider of your choice and have access to the domain name's DNS zone file
  - If you are using **Cloudflare DNS**, see the note below regarding proxying
</Message>

1. On your domain provider's platform (for example, [Scaleway's domains](/network/domains-and-dns/how-to/manage-dns-records/)), add a CNAME record pointing to your container default URL in the domain's DNS zone file.

    <Message type="note">
      - All domains are supported.
      - CNAME flattening is supported. [CNAME flattening](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cname-flattening-rfc-compliant-cnames-at-a-domains-root/) speeds up CNAME resolution and allows you to use a CNAME record at your root/apex domain.
      - If your DNS provider does not support CNAME flattening, you need to create an ALIAS on your root domain (named `@` or with an empty name) instead of a CNAME.
    </Message>
2. Click the **Endpoints** tab on your containers' page.
3. Click **+ Add endpoint**.
4. Enter your custom domain name and validate the form.
5. The console runs checks on the CNAME and TLS configuration of the custom domain name. Connect to your container using your custom domain once all checks have completed.

<Message type="important">
  **Custom Domains** do not currently support websockets. If you need to use websockets, you must configure them with the original container URL.

## Cloudflare DNS

If you use Cloudflare DNS to configure your custom domain, you must set the `CNAME` record's proxy status to **DNS Only** while adding it to your container. We perform a number of validation checks on our side when configuring your domain, and if the `CNAME` record is proxied during these checks, the checks will fail.

Once you have configured your domain and your container is responding correctly, you can set the `CNAME` record back to `Proxied` if you wish.

The [Cloudflare documentation on Proxy Status](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/) describes how to change the Proxy Status of a `CNAME` record via the Cloudflare web UI.
