VPC is a set of products and features that allows you to build your own **V**irtual **P**rivate **C**loud on top of Scaleway's shared public cloud. One default VPC for every available region is automatically created in each Scaleway [Project](/console/my-project/concepts/#project).

Within each VPC, you can create multiple **regional Private Networks** to connect your Scaleway resources across multiple AZs within the same region. This gives you a virtual Layer 2 network, allowing your resources (Instances, Elastic Metal servers, Load Balancers etc.) to communicate in an isolated and secure network, away from the public Internet.

## How to create a regional Private Network

1. Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the side menu.

    A default VPC for each available region has been automatically created for you.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-vpc.webp" alt="" />

2. Click the **Default VPC** for your chosen region.

    If you already have existing regional Private Networks in this VPC, a list of these displays. Otherwise, you see a welcome screen.

3. Click **+ Create regional Private Network**. The creation screen displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-rpn.webp" alt=""/>

4. Enter a **name** for the network, or leave the randomly-generated name in place. Optionally, you can also add one or many tags to help you organize your Private Networks. 

5. Click **Create a regional Private Network** to finish. Your Private Network is created. You are taken back to the **regional Private Networks** dashboard, where your new regional Private Network is now displayed in the list.

## How to attach a resource to a regional Private Network

1. Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the side menu.

    A default VPC for each available region has been automatically created for you.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-vpc.webp" alt="" />

2. Click the **Default VPC** for your chosen region.

    A list of your regional Private Networks in this VPC displays.

3. Click the regional Private Network to which you want to attach resources.

    The regional Private Network's dashboard displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-rpn-dashboard.webp" alt="" />

4. Click the **Attached resources** tab.

    If you already have resources attached to the regional Private Network, a list of these displays. Otherwise, you see a welcome screen.

5. Click **+Attach resource**. The following screen displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-attach-resource.webp" alt="" />

6. Select the type of resource (Instance, Elastic Metal server etc.) that you want to attach. Then select the specific resource to attach. Only resources within the same region (or one of its Availability Zones) as the regional Private Network will be displayed.

7. Click **Attach resource** to finish.

    You are returned to the list of attached resources, where the newly-attached resource now displays.

## How to configure resources in a regional Private Network

Once you have attached a resource to a regional Private Network, it is necessary to configure the resource on the network (e.g. assign it a private IP address on the network).

There are different options for this:

- Use a [Scaleway Public Gateway](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#public-gateway) with DHCP enabled to dynamically assign IP addresses to resources as they join the network. You can also configure other features, such as NAT.
- Carry out configuration manually. See our documentation on [configuring Instances on Private Networks](/compute/instances/how-to/use-private-networks/#how-to-configure-the-private-network-interface-on-your-instances) for help with this.

## How to delete a regional Private Network

1. Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the side menu.

    A default VPC for each available region has been automatically created for you.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-vpc.webp" alt="" />

2. Click the **Default VPC** for your chosen region.

    A list of your regional Private Networks in this VPC displays.

3. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the regional Private Network you want to delete, then click **Delete** on the pop-up menu.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-delete-rpn.webp" alt="" />

    A screen displays asking you to confirm that you want to delete the network, and that you have detached all resources from it.

4. Type **DELETE** and click **Delete regional Private Network**.

  Your regional Private Network is deleted.
