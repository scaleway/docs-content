**I**ntelligent **P**latform **M**anagement **I**nterface (IPMI) and **Redfish** are industry standards to describe the subsystem of a server providing remote management and monitoring capabilities. IPMI and Redfish you a way to manage and monitor a server even if it is powered off or unresponsive, by using a network connection to the hardware. IPMI is made possible by the **B**aseboard **M**anagement **C**ontroller, an independent piece of hardware connected to a network card, composed of an I2C bus and a dedicated processor.

Some examples of features that can be remotely monitored via the BMC include:

  - Ventilation,
  - Temperature,
  - Voltage,
  - Operating time.

Actions that can be carried out via IPMI include:

  - Rebooting via KVM,
  - Switching the server off and/or on,
  - Configuration of automatic notification in case of hardware problems (power supply failure, temperature anomalies, etc.),
  - Viewing of logs from the BIOS,
  - Accessing the serial port and BIOS over the network via serial console.

In this document, we show you how to access the BMC for a Dell or HPE server. See the [KVM-over-IP](/dedibox-kvm-over-ip/) documentation for information about other server models.

<Requirements />

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- [Created](/dedibox/how-to/order-a-server/) and [installed](/dedibox/how-to/install-a-server/) a Dedibox server with a dedicated KVM over IP device

## How to use a Dell iDRAC

On a Dell server, the BMC is known as the iDRAC: the **I**ntegrated **D**ell **R**emote **A**ccess **C**ontroller.

1. From the console, click **Server** > **Server list**. A list of your servers displays.
2. Click **Manage** next to the relevant server.
3. Click the **IDRAC** button on the right. A disclaimer displays.
4. Click **I Accept** to agree with the terms of the disclaimer.
5. Enter the authorized IPv4 address for the iDRAC connection. The IP address of your internet connection is already pre-filled in the form. Then click **Create** to generate your credentials.
    <Message type="note">
      Currently, only IPv4 addresses are accepted.
    </Message>

    The connection URL and your credentials display. Click on the link to access the iDRAC interface.

6. Use the interface to monitor and manage your server's hardware:
    - The **System** tabs let you view various system information including system details, logs, and power status. You can also use the **Console/Media** > **Virtual Media** tab to install your server remotely with a custom OS by connecting virtual media. To launch the KVM, click **Remote Access Controller** under **System Details**.
    - The **iDRAC** tabs show you information about the iDRAC itself.
    - Click the other relevant links on the left sidebar to see information about **Batteries**, **Temperatures**, **Voltages**, etc., as required.

## How to use a HPE iLO

On an HPE server, the BMC is known as the iLO, the **I**ntegrated **L**ights-**O**ut processor.

1. From the console, click **Server** > **Server list**. A list of your servers displays.
2. Click **Manage** next to the relevant server.
3. Click the **iLO** button on the right. A disclaimer displays.
4. Click **I Accept** to agree with the terms of the disclaimer.
5. Enter the authorized IPv4 address for the iLO connection. The IP address of your internet connection is already pre-filled in the form. Then click **Create** to generate your credentials.
    <Message type="note">
      Currently, only IPv4 addresses are accepted.
    </Message>

    The connection URL and your credentials display. Click on the link to access the iLO interface.

    <Lightbox image={image2} alt="" />
6. Use the interface to monitor and manage your server's hardware:
    - The **Information** pages let you view various system information including system details, logs, and diagnostics.
    - The **Remote Console** pages let you launch the KVM.
    - The **Virtual Media** pages let you install your server remotely with a custom OS by connecting virtual media.
    - Click the other relevant links on the left sidebar to see more information.
