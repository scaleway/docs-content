  ## What can I write about?

  You can write any tutorial that you think could be useful for Scaleway users. It must involve a Scaleway product, and any third-party tools the tutorial involves must be free to use and open-source. For example, you could write about how to integrate the Scaleway Database, Kubernetes or Object Storage products with third-party open-source tools in order to achieve specific goals. Check out our [existing tutorials](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/tutorials/) to see the kind of content we publish. If you need more inspiration, why not [take a look at existing documentation requests](https://github.com/scaleway/docs-content/issues) or [ask for ideas on the Community Slack](https://scaleway-community.slack.com/archives/C01J2BT8TGX)?

  ## Can I post my content elsewhere?

  ## What if I have an idea but I do not want to write the content myself?

  We'd still love to hear from you! [Submit your idea or suggestion](https://github.com/scaleway/docs-content/issues/new/choose) by opening a documentation request or bug issue, and specify that you do not plan to write the content yourself. You do not need to include your Organization ID, as you will not be eligible for a reward.
