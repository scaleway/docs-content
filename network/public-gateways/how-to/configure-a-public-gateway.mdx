This page shows you how to attach a [Public Gateway](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#public-gateway) to a Private Network, how to configure NAT and how to enable SMTP.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a Public Gateway](/network/public-gateways/how-to/create-a-public-gateway/)

## How to attach a Public Gateway to a Private Network

1. Click **Public Gateways** in the **Network** section of the side menu.

2. Click the Public Gateway that you want to attach to a Private Network. You are taken to the **Overview** page for that Public Gateway.

3. Click the **Private Networks** tab. A list of Private Networks attached to the Public Gateway displays. If no Private Networks are attached, the list will be empty.

4. Click **Attach to a Private Network** to attach a new Private Network to the Public Gateway.

5. Choose to attach an existing or a new Private Network.
    - If you want to attach an existing Private Network, select **Attach to an existing Private Network** and choose the desired network from the drop-down list.
      <Message type="note">
        Only Private Networks which are in the same region as the Public Gateway are displayed in this list.

    - If you want to create and attach a new Private Network, select **Attach to a new Private Network**. The Private Network will be created with default configuration (a [CIDR block](/network/vpc/concepts#cidr-block) will be automatically defined), in your default VPC for the region. A name for the Private Network will be suggested for you, but feel free to overwrite this with a new name of your choice. Dynamic NAT will be automatically activated on the Public Gateway for the Private Network.
6. Use the toggle to select whether to **Advertise the default route**. Find out more about this setting in our [concepts documentation](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#default-route).
7. Click **Attach to Private Network** to finish. You are taken back to the Private Networks tab, where the network you attached now appears, along with the services configured and the IP address of the Public Gateway.

Your Private Network is now attached to your Public Gateway. You can repeat the steps above to attach more Private Networks to the same Public Gateway if you wish.

## How to review and configure NAT

Dynamic NAT is automatically activated. However, you can review and (if you wish) modify the NAT configuration of an existing Public Gateway as follows:

1. Click **Public Gateways** in the **Network** section of the side menu.
2. Click the Public Gateway whose configuration you wish to modify. You are taken to the Overview page for that Public Gateway.
3. Click the **NAT** tab.
4. Use the toggle to deactivate dynamic NAT if desired. To add a new static NAT configuration for any Private Network attached to this gateway, click **Add Static NAT**. The following screen displays:

5. Add the following information for your new static NAT configuration:
    - **Protocol**: Choose TCP, UDP or Both from the drop-down menu
    - **Public Port**: Choose the Public Gateway port you want to use for this mapping
    - **Private IP address**: Enter the Private IP address of the Instance you want to map to. This should be included within one of the configured subnets of an attached Private Network. Usually, a static DHCP association is used too, to make sure this address does not change.
    - **Private Port**: Choose which of the Instance's ports you want to map to.
6. Click <Icon name="validate" /> to save your configuration changes, or <Icon name="cancel" /> to cancel.

    Your new NAT configuration is now saved, and displays on the NAT panel. You can repeat steps 4-6 to add new static NAT configurations as you wish.

## How to enable SMTP

By default, the SMTP ports (25, 465, 587 and 2525) on your Public Gateway are blocked to avoid spam. If you wish to send emails from resources located behind your Public Gateway, make sure those resources [have also enabled SMTP](/compute/instances/how-to/send-emails-from-your-instance/) and then enable SMTP on your Public Gateway as follows:

1. Click **Public Gateways** in the **Network** section of the side menu.
2. Click the Public Gateway whose configuration you wish to modify. You are taken to the **Overview** page for that Public Gateway.
3. Scroll down to the **SMTP** panel, and use the toggle <Icon name="toggle" /> to enable SMTP.
