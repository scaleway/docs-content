You can delete an Edge Services pipeline at any time. Follow the steps below, depending on whether your pipeline is towards an Object Storage bucket origin or a Load Balancer origin.

## How to disable Edge Services for an Object Storage bucket

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of your buckets displays.

2. Click the name of the bucket you want to disable Edge Services for.

3. Click the **Edge Services** tab.

4. In the **Disable Edge Services** panel at the bottom of the screen, click **Disable Edge Services**.

    A pop-up displays, informing you that the bucket will be removed from Edge Services.
      - The bucket will no longer be accessible via its Edge Services endpoint, or any customized domains pointing to this endpoint.
      - Any files stored in the Edge Services cache will be removed.
    
    <Message type="tip">
    Remember to:
        - Delete your CNAME record from your domain provider, unless your domain is managed with Scaleway Domains and DNS, in which case we take care of deletion for you.
        - Delete any SSL/TLS certificates you imported into Secret Manager (if no longer required elsewhere, so that you are no longer billed for it). If you generated a managed Let's Encrypt certificate however, Scaleway takes care of the deletion for you.

5. Click **Disable Edge Services**.

    Edge Services is disabled and the pipeline for this bucket is deleted. You can enable it again at any time to create a new pipeline, but you will need to reconfigure your custom domain, and the cache will initially be empty.

## How to delete an Edge Services pipeline for a Load Balancer origin

1. Click **Load Balancers** in the **Network** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of your Load Balancers displays.

2. Click the **Edge Services** tab. A list of your pipelines displays.

3. Click the pipeline you want to delete. The Edge Services dashboard for that pipeline displays.

4. In the **Delete Edge Services pipeline** panel at the bottom of the screen, click **Delete Edge Services pipeline**.

        A pop-up displays, informing you that the pipeline will be deleted
        - The Load Balancer origin will no longer be accessible via its Edge Services endpoint, or any customized domains pointing to this endpoint.
        - Any files stored in the Edge Services cache for this pipeline will be removed.
    
        <Message type="tip">
        If you set up a customized domain for your Edge Services endpoint, remember to:
            - Delete your CNAME record from your domain provider, unless your domain is managed with Scaleway Domains and DNS, in which case we take care of deletion for you.
            - Delete any SSL/TLS certificates you imported into Secret Manager (if no longer required elsewhere, so that you are no longer billed for it). If you generated a managed Let's Encrypt certificate however, Scaleway takes care of the deletion for you.

5. Click **Confirm*.

    The Edge Services pipeline for this Load Balancer origin is deleted. You create a new pipeline at any time, but you will need to reconfigure any custom domains, and the cache will initially be empty.
