[Scaleway Object Storage](/storage/object/concepts/#object-storage) is a service based on the S3 protocol. It allows you to store different types of objects (documents, images, videos, etc.) and distribute them instantly, anywhere in the world. You can create and manage your Object Storage resources from the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/login), or via the [Scaleway Command Line Interface](/developer-tools/scaleway-cli/quickstart/) that uses external tools such as `rclone`, `s3cmd` and `mc`.

## Scaleway Command Line Interface Overview

[The Scaleway Command Line Interface (CLI)](/developer-tools/scaleway-cli/quickstart/) allows you to pilot your Scaleway infrastructure directly from your terminal, providing a faster way to administer and monitor your resources. Scaleway CLI is easy to set up and is an essential tool for operating efficiently in your cloud environment. 

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
- An [Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)
- Installed and initialized the [Scaleway CLI](/developer-tools/scaleway-cli/quickstart/)
- Downloaded [S3cmd](https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd), [rclone](https://rclone.org/downloads/) and [mc](https://github.com/minio/mc) s3 tools


## Creating a configuration file for the Scaleway CLI

<Message type="important">
  Unless you add a region argument to your commands, the configuration file will be set for the default region.
</Message>

1. Run the following command in a terminal to create a configuration file with `rclone`:

    ```
    scw object config get type=rclone
    ```

    An output similar to the following displays:

    ```
    # Generated by scaleway-cli command
    # Configuration file for rclone https://rclone.org/s3/#scaleway
    # Default location: $HOME/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
    [scaleway]
    type = s3
    env_auth = false
    endpoint = s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud
    access_key_id = SCW85PRCA6HD4PDEWS5M
    secret_access_key = 8bd5d8ce-d476-4bd5-b97d-2d97e04c3c4d
    region = nl-ams
    location_constraint =
    acl = private
    force_path_style = false
    server_side_encryption =
    storage_class =
    ```
2. Run the following command in a terminal to create a configuration file with `s3cmd`:

    ```
    scw object config get type=s3cmd
    ```
    An output similar to the following displays:

    ```
    # Generated by scaleway-cli command
    # Configuration file for s3cmd https://s3tools.org/s3cmd
    # Default location: $HOME/.s3cfg
    [default]
    access_key = SCW85PRCA6HD4PDEWS5M
    bucket_location = nl-ams
    host_base = s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud
    host_bucket = %(bucket)s.s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud
    secret_key = 12345678-1234-1234-4321-123456789123
    use_https = True
    ```
3. Run the following command in a terminal to create a configuration file with `mc`:
    ```
    scw object config get type=mc
    ```

    An output similar to the following displays:

    ```
    {"version":"9","hosts":{"scaleway":{"url":"https://s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud","accessKey":"SCW1111111111111","secretKey":"12345678-1234-1234-4321-123456789123","api":"S3v4"}}}
    ```

    s3cmd mb s3://your-bucket
    ```

    An output similar to the following displays:

    ```
