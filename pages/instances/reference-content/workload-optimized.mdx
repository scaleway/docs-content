An Instance is a virtual machine in the cloud. Scaleway supports several [types of Instances](/instances/reference-content/choosing-instance-type/), each with their own set of resources, unique value propositions, and technical specifications. Each Instance supports the essential operating systems and distributions, as well as customized [InstantApps](/instances/concepts/#instantapp).

## Workload-Optimized range: POP2-HM and POP2-HC Instances

Scaleway's **Workload-Optimized** range includes POP2-HM (High Memory), POP2-HN (High Network) and POP2-HC (High CPU). Equipped with dedicated vCPUs, these Instances are optimized for workload-intensive applications.

* **High-Memory**: Designed for RAM-intensive usages, and high memory production applications, these machines provide the highest RAM to vCPU ratio. These Instances are designed for high-demanding analysis, in-memory calculation, big-data processing, high-performance, or cache databases.

* **High-CPU**: Made for high computing workloads and compute-bound applications, this machine provides the highest vCPU to RAM ratio. Designed for high-performance web-serving, video encoding, machine learning, batch processing, CI/CD.
