This page shows you how to deploy your first Serverless Container from an external registry.

A container is a package of software that includes all dependencies: code, runtime, configuration, and system libraries so that it can run on any host system. This allows you to control your production environment. Scaleway provides custom Docker images that are entirely handled for you in the cloud. With Serverless Containers, you can rely on your favorite technologies such as Django or Ruby on Rails.

For now, Serverless Containers only supports public images.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a containers namespace](/serverless/containers/how-to/create-a-containers-namespace/)
- A container image that is available without authentication

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The containers page displays.
2. Click the relevant container's namespace.
3. Click **Deploy container**. The container creation wizard displays.
4. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Select the **External** container registry.
    - Enter the public container **image URL** provided by the external registry. For example:
      - `nginx:latest` to deploy the latest nginx image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=)
      - `ghcr.io/namespace/image` to deploy an image from [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/features/packages)
    - Choose the [port](/serverless/containers/concepts/#port) your container is listening on. We recommend configuring your container to listen on the `$PORT` environment variable.
    - Choose a **name** for your container and, optionally, a **description**. The name must only contain alphanumeric characters and dashes.
    - Choose the **resources** to be allocated to your container at runtime. These define the performance characteristics of your container.
        <Message type="note">
        Available memory depends on allocated VCPU, and maximum ephemeral storage value depends on allocated memory.
        </Message>
    - Set your [scaling](/serverless/containers/concepts/#scaling) preferences, or leave them at default values. The Scaleway platform autoscales the number of available instances of your container to match the incoming load, depending on the settings you define here.
    - Click **Advanced options** to define any [environment variables](/serverless/containers/concepts/#environment-variables) you want to inject into your container. For each environment variable, click **+Add variable** and enter the key/value pair.
    - Add [secrets](/serverless/containers/concepts/#secrets) for your container. Secrets are environment variables which are injected into your container, but the values are not retained or displayed by Scaleway after initial validation.
    - Set the desired [privacy policy](/serverless/containers/concepts/#privacy-policy) for your container. This defines whether container invocation may be done anonymously (**public**) or only via an authentication mechanism provided by the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-containers/#authentication) (**private**).
    - Set a custom [timeout](/serverless/containers/concepts/#timeout) for your container.
    - Verify the **estimated cost**.
5. Click **Deploy container** to finish.
