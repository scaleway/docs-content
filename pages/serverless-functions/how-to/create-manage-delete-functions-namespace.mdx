This page shows you how to create, manage, and delete a Functions namespace using the Scaleway console.

[Namespaces](/serverless-functions/concepts/#namespace) allow you to group your [functions](/serverless-functions/concepts/#function) and share environment variables, secrets and tokens between them.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## Creating a Serverless Functions namespace

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.

2. Click **+ Create namespace**. If you have no existing Serverless Functions resources in your current Project, click **Create a function**. The functions namespace creation wizard displays.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Enter a **name** or use the automatically generated one. The name can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes.
    - Enter an optional **description**.
    - Choose a **region**, which is the geographical location in which your namespace will be deployed.
    - Click **+ Add advanced options** to define any **environment variables** you want to inject into your function. For each environment variable, click **+ Add variable** and enter the key/value pair.
    - Set optional secret environment variables. **Secrets** are environment variables which are injected into your function and stored securely, but not displayed in the console after initial validation. Add a **key** and a **value**.
4. Click **Create namespace only** to finish, or click **Create namespace and add a function** if you want to [create a function](/serverless-functions/how-to/create-a-function/) next.


## Managing a Serverless Functions namespace

### Generating and managing access tokens

The Scaleway console allows you to generate authentication tokens to grant users and applications access to the functions present in your namespace.

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.

2. Click the functions namespace you want to manage.

3. Click the **Namespace settings** tab. Information about the region, registry endpoint and description of your namespace display.

4. Click **+ Generate token** to create an access token for this namespace.

    <Message type="important">
    The token key will only be available for copy once. Make sure to store it securely before leaving the page.
    </Message>

Private functions present in your namespace now require the authentication token to be executed, as shown below:
    ```curl
    curl -H "X-Auth-Token: <YOUR_FUNCTION_TOKEN>" <YOUR_FUNCTION_ENDPOINT>
    ```

### Managing environment variables and secrets

The Scaleway console allows you to define environment variables and secrets at the namespace-level to pass to the functions present in the namespace.

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.

2. Click the functions namespace you want to manage.

3. Click the **Namespace settings** tab. Information about the region, registry endpoint and description of your namespace display.

4. Add any additional environment variables by clicking the <Icon name="edit" /> icon, **+ Add variable**, entering the key/value pair, and clicking <Icon name="validate"/>.

5. Add any additional secrets by clicking the <Icon name="edit" /> icon, **+ Add secret**, entering the key/value pair, and clicking <Icon name="validate"/>.

The environment variables and secrets defined will now be passed to your functions. Every function in a **ready** state is redeployed to take the change into account.

## Deleting a Serverless Functions namespace

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.

2. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the namespace you want to delete, and select **Delete** from the drop-down menu.

3. Type **DELETE** in the pop-up that asks you to confirm the action, then click **Delete namespace**.

<Message type="tip">
  You can also delete a namespace from the **Namespace settings** tab.
