On this page, we outline the roles and responsibilities for maintaining and securing your Virtual and GPU Instances. Our shared responsibility model clarifies the division of duties between Scaleway and our users, ensuring clarity in managing Instances availability, backups, configurations, and security measures. By understanding this shared responsibility, you can optimize the performance, reliability, and security of your Scaleway CPU Instances and GPU Instances services.

## Overview of the "Cloud Security vs. Security in the Cloud" Model

At Scaleway, the security of your data and applications is crucial. To ensure a robust and secure environment, we operate under a shared responsibility model, which clearly distinguishes Scaleway's obligations from those of our users. This model is often conceptualized as "Security *of* the Cloud" and "Security *in* the Cloud".

### Security of the Cloud (Scaleway's Responsibility)


Scaleway is responsible for the **security *of* the Cloud**. This means we are committed to protecting the overall infrastructure that runs all services offered in the Scaleway Cloud. Our responsibilities include:

* **Physical security of data centers:** Protection of facilities, access control, monitoring.
* **Network infrastructure security:** Protection of networks, platforms, and operating systems that underpin our services.
* **Virtualization security:** Resource isolation, hypervisors, and management of virtual environments.
* **Infrastructure maintenance and updates:** Applying security patches and updates for components managed by Scaleway.
* **Compliance and certifications:** Maintaining our own certifications (e.g., ISO 27001, HDS) and adhering to regulations applicable to our role as a cloud service provider.

In other words, Scaleway is responsible for protecting the environment in which your Instances reside.


### Security in the Cloud (User's Responsibility)

The user is responsible for the **security *in* the Cloud**. Once resources are made available to you, you are in charge of the security of everything you deploy, configure, and manage within that environment. Your responsibilities include:

* **Instance management:** Operating system configuration, applications, middleware, patches, and software updates for your Instances.
* **Data management:** Data encryption (at rest and in transit), backup management, integrity, and confidentiality of your information.
* **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Configuration of permissions, roles, SSH keys, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and the principle of least privilege for accessing your resources.
* **Network security of your Instances:** Configuration of firewalls, security groups, and network access for your Instances.
* **Application security:** Protecting your applications against vulnerabilities, managing dependencies, and monitoring application logs.
* **Compliance of your workloads:** Ensuring that your applications and data comply with industry regulations and your own internal security policies.

This shared responsibility model is essential for a comprehensive and effective security approach. It allows you to leverage the robustness of the Scaleway infrastructure while retaining the flexibility and control necessary to secure your own workloads. A clear understanding of these roles ensures that all facets of security are considered.

## Product resiliency

### Availability

The detailed SLAs measurements and guarantees can be found at [Service Level Agreement for Scaleway Instances Services](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/sla/).

Once the resource is in your hands, we have no access to the machine and therefore no way to monitor its operation. In case of any operational issues, we invite you to consult our documentation or create a ticket with our support team. We will then do our utmost to ensure that you regain access to your resources as quickly as possible.

### Backups and snapshots

You are fully responsible for managing your virtual machine and its data.
It is your responsibility to ensure data redundancy if necessary, by relying on backups or Instance snapshots.
It is your responsibility to define the necessary redundancy measures based on the nature and criticality level of your data. We remind you that a snapshot does not in any way constitute a permanent backup of your data, but only an "instantaneous" copy of the Instance.


Block Storage volumes are replicated three times to provide storage redundancy availability of 99.99%.

However, when using Local Storage & Scratch Storage and in the event of a disk or a hardware failure on the underlying hypervisor,  we cannot guarantee that you will regain access to your virtual machine and data on Local Storage. The failure may require a complete replacement of the virtual machine. Therefore, it is your responsibility to ensure in advance that you have a backup or redundancy of your data on another Instance or storage means. We cannot be held responsible for the loss of your data.
Backups and snapshots must be configured and managed by you. Please refer to our documentation for assistance in setting up backups for Instances [via the CLI/API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/instances/api-cli/creating-backups/) or the [Scaleway console](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/instances/how-to/create-a-backup/). Restoring snapshots or backups needs to be triggered by you.

### Block Storage performances and Instances block bandwidth

Block Storage volumes are available with 5,000 or 15,000 IOPS (input/output operations per second). The actual storage performance is determined by the block bandwidth available for each Instance type. All Block Storage compatible Instance types support both Block Storage volume types, however the performance may vary depending on the block bandwidth available. Refer to the [Scaleway Instances internet and Block Storage bandwidth overview for Virtual Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/instances/reference-content/instances-bandwidth-overview/) and to [Scaleway GPU Instances internet and Block Storage bandwidth overview](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/gpu/reference-content/gpu-instances-bandwidth-overview/) for GPU Instances.

## Configuration and version management

### Installation and configuration

We provide a range of Linux and Windows OS distributions for automatic image installation from the Scaleway console. These distributions come with a default configuration designed for standard use cases, ensuring security, usage efficiency, and reliability. During the setup of your machine, you can modify and customize this initial configuration. However, you are responsible for any impact on your Instance’s availability, security, or performance.

In the event that you use a custom image, it is your responsibility to ensure a reliable and secure configuration of your machine. A custom image is a user-created disk image with a preconfigured OS, software, or settings. It allows users to deploy new Instances with their environment already set up, instead of using a standard image or InstantApp.

### Updates and version management

We regularly provide OS version updates, allowing you to upgrade your environment if desired. It is your responsibility to update your machine to the desired version and thus maintain its compatibility with all internal and external resources at Scaleway.
If you perform manual upgrades without reinstalling your machine with an image provided by Scaleway, it is your responsibility to ensure the reliability and stability of your machine’s configuration.

### Scalway API/CLI upgrades and breaking changes

As part of our ongoing efforts to improve and enhance the functionality of Scaleway Instances, we may release updates to our API that could potentially introduce breaking changes. These changes may affect the compatibility of older versions of our Command-Line Interface (CLI), scripts, automations, or development tools (devtools) used by our users.
It is the responsibility of the user to actively monitor potential upgrades and ensure that their CLI version, as well as any scripts, automations, or devtools they use to interact with Scaleway’s Instances API, are regularly updated to the latest version available. This includes, but is not limited to:
Keeping the CLI up-to-date with the latest releases
Updating custom scripts and automations to be compatible with the latest API versions
Ensuring that any third-party devtools or integrations like Terraform or Packer are compatible with the latest API versions published by Scaleway.


### Usage compliance

You are responsible for the proper use of your resources. In this regard, you are responsible for maintaining the use of your instances in accordance with Scaleway’s compliance policy and terms of services, as well as those of the various operating systems you use.
<Message type="important">
  It is your responsibility to inform yourself beforehand about the permitted and prohibited use cases for your instances and to adhere to them throughout your usage.

## Data protection

### Encryption in transit
Instances (CPU and GPU) support SSH connections to secure your communication with them. You remain responsible for configuring SSH keys.

### Data encryption

You are responsible for encrypting the volumes on your Instance. We are not responsible for data encryption, especially in cases of sensitive applications or additional security requirements.
Refer to our documentation on [encrypting volumes for sensitive data](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/tutorials/encrypt-volumes/) for further information.


### Data deletion

* **Local storage:** When you delete your Instance, we are responsible for removing all of your data on the Local Storage of the Instance.
* **Scratch storage:** The encryption key of the scratch storage of your instance is deleted and can not be restored after deletion. Disk’s data is therefore made unavailable at deletion. 
* **Block storage:** Block Storage volumes remain, by default, attached to your account with their data stored on them. To delete Block Storage volumes you can explicitly request volume deletion when deleting the Instance. If not deleted, volumes remain in your account for further usage (re-attribution to a new or existing Instance) or until deleted by your request.

### Scaleway access
We do not have the technical capability to access your virtual machine once it is installed, nor the data stored on it. We have no visibility into your use of the Instance and its configuration. Therefore, it is your responsibility to ensure the security of your virtual machine and data.

## Identity and access management

Virtual Instances (CPU and GPU) provide IAM permissions sets which allow or restrict specific actions a user or application can perform, such as creating or deleting Instances. You remain responsible for giving these permissions to the relevant users or applications and reviewing these accesses frequently.
Managing access and permissions for creating, modifying, using, and deleting a resource remains in any case your responsibility.

## Platform security
Our security guarantees are available at https://www.scaleway.com/en/security-and-resilience/, and our certifications and commitments are available in our [Trust Center](https://security.scaleway.com/).

## Security best practices
For optimal security, we recommend that you:
* use an ED25519 SSH key to access your machine, rather than using username and password authentication,
* check and update the firewall and filtering rules if necessary (following the principle of least privilege: "Deny all by default, allow by exception"),
* configure security groups for your Instances to limit their exposure on the internet,
* regularly update the operating system to take advantage of configuration updates and security patches,
* regularly monitor our changelog and documentation for updates on API changes and update automation tools and CLI regularly to avoid unnoticed breaking changes
