The serverless framework is a command line tool, written in Node.js. It allows you to create and mange your Serverless Functions and Serverless Containers resources from the command line. 


1. Check that you have `node` and `npm` installed on your local machine: 

    ```
    $ node -v
    $ npm -v
    ```

    Both commands should return the installed version of each tool. 

    <Message type="note">

    The serverless framework works with Node.js 6.x or later.

2. Install the serverless framework using `npm`: 

    ```
    npm install -g serverless
    ```

3. Check if the installation was sucessful:

    ```
    serverless -v 
    ```

    The command above returns the version of the serverless framework installed on your computer.

4. Create a new Python 3 project, called `myProject`:

    ```
    serverless create --template-url https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-scaleway-functions/tree/master/examples/python3 --path myProject
    ```
5. Enter the newly created project:

    ```
    cd myProject
    ```

    Your project contains the following files: 
    * `handler.py` - Your function code, written in Python3
    * `package.json` - The list of packages for your function
    * `serverless.yml` - Your serverless configuration

6. Install the Serverless Functions plugin in your project: 

    ```
    serverless plugin install -n serverless-scaleway-functions
    ```

7. Once you have written your function, deploy it using:

    ```
    serverless deploy 
    ```
