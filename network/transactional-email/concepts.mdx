##  IP reputation

IP reputation measures the trustworthiness of an IP address and the amount of unwanted requests it sends. An IP address that sends authentic, spam-free emails, is assigned a good IP reputation. An IP address that sends high amounts of spam or viruses is assigned a bad IP reputation. IP reputation allows you to reject requests that are coming from an IP address with a bad reputation.
