<Macro id="requirements" />

- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner/) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission/) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## Problem

I cannot delete my Scaleway Object Storage bucket.

## Solution

- Make sure there is no [bucket policy](/storage/object/concepts/#bucket-policy/) that prevents you from deleting the bucket.

- If there is a bucket policy, make sure that it [explicitly allows you](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/) to perform the desired action.

<Message type="note">
- The effective deletion of the bucket will start 24 hours after the deletion request.
- The bucket name will then be available for other customers to use.
- We recommend you erase all objects and versions in the bucket before requesting the deletion
- Files larger than 1 GB can take longer to be deleted.
</Message>

## Going further

- Refer to the documentation on [how to delete a bucket](/storage/object/how-to/delete-a-bucket/) for more information.

- If you did not manage to identify the error and solve it by yourself, [open a support ticket](/console/account/how-to/open-a-support-ticket/), and provide as many details as possible, along with the necessary information below:
    - S3 Endpoint (e.g. `s3.fr-par.scw.cloud`)
    - Bucket name
    - Object name (if the request concerns an object)
    - Request type (PUT, GET, etc.)
    - HTTP status code
    - Date and time (timestamp)
    - User-agent (SDK, client, console, etc.)
    - Transaction ID (if possible)
    - Log / trace of the error (if possible)
