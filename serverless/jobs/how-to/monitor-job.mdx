You can monitor the activity of your Serverless Jobs using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) to check the current status of your runs. Also, Scaleway Serverlerss Jobs is fully integrated into [Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/quickstart/), and allows you to quickly access your logs. This page explains how to get started with Scaleway Cockpit for viewing your Serverless Jobs logs.

## How to monitor your Serverless Jobs from the Scaleway Console

### Monitor the activity of all your jobs

1. Click **Jobs** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The jobs page displays.

2. Click the **History** tab.

A list of every job runs in the current project displays. Refer to the [next section](#monitor-the-activity-of-a-specific-job) for more information on each element of a job run.

### Monitor the activity of a specific job

1. Click **Jobs** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The jobs page displays.

2. Click the name of the job you want to monitor. The **Overview** tab displays.

The **Job runs** section lists all the executions of your Serverless job, and provides the following elements:

- Status: the current status of your job (running, succeeded, canceled, or failed)
- Run ID: a unique identifier for each job run
- Starting date: date and time at which your run began
- End date: date and time at which your run finished
- Duration: the total time to execute your job

## How to activate your Cockpit

Scaleway Cockpit is deactivated by default, but you can easily activate it in the Scaleway console by following [this procedure](/observability/cockpit/how-to/activate-cockpit/).

## How to access the Grafana dashboard

To view your Serverless Jobs logs, use the Grafana dashboard which is accessible from the Scaleway console:
  - First you must create a user and their associated credentials (a username and password) for Grafana
  - Then use these credentials to access the Grafana dashboard for all your Scaleway products, via the Scaleway console.

1. Create a Grafana user and retrieve their username and password by following [this procedure](/observability/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/).

2. From the Scaleway console [Cockpit overview page](https://console.scaleway.com/cockpit/overview), click **Open dashboards** in the top right corner.

3. Enter your Grafana username and password to log in.

    You are directed to the Scaleway Cockpit dashboards homepage.

4. From the **Scaleway Dashboards** panel, select **Serverless Jobs Logs**.

  You are directed to the dashboard. You can use the filters in the top left corner of the page to refine the displayed logs.
