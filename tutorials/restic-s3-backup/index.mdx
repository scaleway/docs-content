Restic is a backup tool that allows you to back up your Linux, Windows, Mac, or BSD machines and send your backups to repositories via [different storage protocols](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html), including Object Storage.

In this tutorial, you learn how to backup a Scaleway Instance running on Ubuntu 20.04 using Restic and Object Storage.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- A valid [API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
- An [Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) running on Ubuntu Focal Fossa (20.04)
- [Installed and configured the AWS-CLI](/object-storage/api-cli/object-storage-aws-cli/) to use with Scaleway Object Storage
- [Created an Object Storage bucket](/object-storage/how-to/create-a-bucket/)

## Installing Restic

1. Connect to your Instance with SSH. In a terminal run:
    ```
    ssh root@<your_instance_ip>
    ```
2. Update the system and upgrade the software already installed on the Instance.
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
3. Install Restic.
    ```
    apt-get install restic
    ```
4. Ensure the installation was successful by checking the version.
    ```
    restic version
    ```

## Setting up the Object Storage repository

A repository is the storage space where your backups will be hosted. In this tutorial, we will use Scaleway Object Storage buckets to host our backups.

1. Set up your [environment variables](/scaleway-cli/reference-content/environment-variables/), if you have not done so yet. Replace `$SCW_ACCESS_KEY` and `$SCW_SECRET_KEY` with their corresponding values.
    ```
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$SCW_ACCESS_KEY
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$SCW_SECRET_KEY
    ```
2. Initialize the repository using your bucket's endpoint as a backend. Your bucket endpoint can be found in the **Bucket settings** tab under **Bucket Information**.
    ```
    restic -r s3:https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/<bucket_name> init
    ```
3. Enter a password for the repository and repeat it when prompted.
    ```
    enter password for new repository:
    enter password again:
    ```
    <Message type="important">
      The password is required to access the repository. If you lose the password, your data will be irrevocably lost.
    </Message>

    <Message type="tip">
      Restic requests you to enter the password every time you perform actions on your repository. If you have configured automatic backups, you can set up an [environment variable](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/040_backup.html#environment-variables) for your password.
    </Message>

An output displays, informing the name and path of your repository.

```
created restic repository da8e38a165 at s3:https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/<bucket_name>
```

## Creating backups

1. Run the command below to create a backup. Include the path to your repository (in this example, the path is the endpoint of your bucket), and the path of the directory you want to back up (`~/<my-directory>` in the example).
    ```
    restic -r s3:https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/<bucket_name> backup ~/<my-directory>
    ```

    The command above creates a snapshot of your directory and sends it to your repository. The snapshot is stored as an object in your bucket.

    <Message type="tip">
      By default, the backups you create are stored using `STANDARD` [storage class](/object-storage/concepts/#storage-class). If you want to use a different storage class, you can add the `-o s3.storage-class=<STORAGE_CLASS>` option to your command, as shown below:
      ```
      restic -r s3:https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/<bucket_name> backup -o s3.storage-class=ONEZONE_IA ~/<my-directory>
      ```
    </Message>
2. Enter the password for the repository when prompted.
    ```
    enter password for repository:
    ```

    If the operation is successful, you will see the following output:

    ```
    repository da8e38a1 opened successfully, password is correct
    created new cache in /root/.cache/restic

    Files:           1 new,     0 changed,     0 unmodified
    Dirs:            1 new,     0 changed,     0 unmodified
    Added to the repo: 732 B

    processed 1 files, 22 B in 0:06
    snapshot 15a39fd5 saved
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      Restic does not offer a built-in tool for automated backups. Restic recommends using tools like systemd and cron to schedule backup runs. Learn more on the [Restic documentation](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/040_backup.html#scheduling-backups).
    </Message>
3. Run the following command to verify that the backup was successful:
    ```
    aws s3api list-objects --bucket <bucket_name>
    ```

    Alternatively, you can access your bucket via the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/object-storage/buckets/). You can find the snapshots of your directory in the `/snapshots` folder.

## Restoring from backups

1. Retrieve a list of your snapshots to identify the ID of the snapshot you want to restore. Make sure you specify the path to your repository in the command.
    ```
    restic snapshots -r s3:https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/<bucket_name>

    enter password for repository:
    repository da8e38a1 opened successfully, password is correct
    ID        Time                 Host                Tags        Paths
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    15a39fd5  2022-04-06 14:39:25  scw-jovial-keldysh              /root/my-directory
    20eed69e  2022-04-06 15:09:01  scw-jovial-keldysh              /root/my-directory
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    2 snapshots
    ```
2. Run the command below to restore your backup. Specify the path to your repository and the target directory.
    ```
    restic -r s3:https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/<bucket_name> restore 15a39fd5 --target ~/<my-directory>
    ```

    If the operation is successful, the following output displays:

    ```
    enter password for repository:
    repository da8e38a1 opened successfully, password is correct
    restoring <Snapshot 15a39fd5 of [/root/my-directory] at 2022-04-06 14:39:25.024340615 +0000 UTC by root@scw-jovial-keldysh> to /root/my-directory
    ```
