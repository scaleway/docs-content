Public IP addresses are routed on the Internet. You can enter the public IP address of your instance into any browser connected to the Internet, and access content being served from that instance. You can think of public IP addresses like postal addresses for buildings - they are unique, and tell the routers directing traffic through the Internet where to find a particular server.
