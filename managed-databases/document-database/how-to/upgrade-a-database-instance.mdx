You can upgrade your Database Instance in two ways: by increasing its Block Storage volume or by changing the node type.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have a [Document Database Instance](/managed-databases/document-database/quickstart)
</Message>

## How to increase a Block Storage volume

1. Scroll down to **Volume settings** in the overview page of your selected Database Instance.
2. Click **Increase volume size**. A pop-up appears.
3. Specify your volume capacity (in GB). The amount you define will be your new volume capacity.
    <Message type="important">
      - You can increase your Block Storage volume to up to 10 TB.
      - Block volume sizes cannot be decreased.
    </Message>
4. Click **Increase volume size** to confirm.

## How to change the node type

1. Click **Document Databases** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the name of the Database Instance that you want to upgrade.
3. Scroll down to the **Node Settings** section in the **Database Information** page. Then, click **Change node type**.
4. Choose the specifications of the new Database Instance from the dropdown list.
5. Click **Update node type** to confirm your choices.
    <Message type="important">
      Make sure that the Database Instance you choose provides sufficient disk space for your database. Otherwise, an error message will be displayed, and the database will not be upgraded.
    </Message>

The action of changing the node type will perform a rolling upgrade of your Database Instance. During this process, the Database Instance will be unavailable for several tens of seconds.
