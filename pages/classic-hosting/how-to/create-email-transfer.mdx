Email transfers allow you to forward the incoming mail of an existing account to another address of your choice.

<Requirements />

- A Dedibox account logged into the Online [console](https://console.online.net)
- Created a **Webhosting Classic**

  In some cases, the forwarded mails are considered spam and are not properly received. If that happens, we recommend importing the mails received at your existing address from your other provider instead of forwarding them.

2. Scroll down to **E-mail accounts** section, then click **E-mail forwarding**.
3. Click **Add e-mail forward**.
