An IAM application is a non-human user in an [Organization](#organization). This feature lets you create API keys that are not linked to a specific user, to give programmatic access to resources and make your production code more robust. As with users, you can define permissions and access rights for each IAM application via policies.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

1. Click **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** from your [**Organization Dashboard**](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) in the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) displays.

3. Click [Create application](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/applications/create). The creation wizard displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-iam-create-app.webp" alt="" />
4. Complete the steps of the creation wizard:
    - Enter a name for the application, or use the auto-generated name suggested for you,
    - Add a tag (optional),
    <Message type="note">
      Tags are key/value pairs that help you organize your users. Keep in mind that:
      - You can assign up to 10 tags per user
      - Tag values must be between 1 and 70 characters long, including `key` and `value`
      - The same tag cannot be used twice
    </Message>
    - Enter a description (optional),
    - Attach an existing policy to the application (optional).
    <Message type="note">
      You can choose not to attach a policy to the application at this stage. Unless your application is a part of a group, be aware that until you attach a policy to the application, it will have no permissions in your Organization.
    </Message>
5. Click **Create application** to finish.

    You are returned to the list of your applications, where your newly created application now appears.
