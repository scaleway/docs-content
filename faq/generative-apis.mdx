### What are Scaleway Generative APIs?
Scaleway's Generative APIs provide access to pre-configured, serverless endpoints of leading AI models, hosted in European data centers. This allows you to integrate advanced AI capabilities into your applications without managing underlying infrastructure.

## Which models are supported by Generative APIs?
Our Generative APIs support a range of popular models, including:
- Instruct models: Refer to our dedicated [documentation](/generative-apis/reference-content/supported-models/#chat-models) for a list of supported chat models.
- Embedding models: Refer to our dedicated [documentation](/generative-apis/reference-content/supported-models/#embedding-models) for a list of supported embedding models.

## How does the free tier work?
The free tier allows you to process up to 1,000,000 tokens without incurring any costs. After reaching this limit, you will be charged per million tokens processed. For more information, refer to our [pricing page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/model-as-a-service/#generative-apis).

## How can I access and use the Generative APIs?
Access is open to all Scaleway customers. You can start by using the Generative APIs Playground in the Scaleway console to experiment with different models. For integration into applications, you can use the OpenAI-compatible APIs provided by Scaleway. Detailed instructions are available in our [Quickstart guide](/generative-apis/quickstart/).

## Where are the inference servers located?
All models are currently hosted in a secure data center located in Paris, France, operated by [OPCORE](https://www.opcore.com/). This ensures low latency for European users and compliance with European data privacy regulations.

## Where can I find the privacy policy regarding Generative APIs?
You can find the privacy policy applicable to all use of Generative APIs [here](/generative-apis/reference-content/data-privacy/).

## Can I use OpenAI libraries and APIs with Scaleway's Generative APIs?
Yes, Scaleway's Generative APIs are designed to be compatible with OpenAI libraries and SDKs, including the OpenAI Python client library and LangChain SDKs. This allows for seamless integration with existing workflows.

## What is the difference between Generative APIs and Managed Inference?
- **Generative APIs**: A serverless service providing access to pre-configured AI models via API, billed per token usage.
- **Managed Inference**: Allows deployment of curated or custom models with chosen quantization and instances, offering predictable throughput and enhanced security features like private network isolation and access control.

## How do I get started with Generative APIs?
To get started, explore the [Generative APIs Playground](/generative-apis/quickstart/#start-with-the-generative-apis-playground) in the Scaleway console. For application integration, refer to our [Quickstart guide](/generative-apis/quickstart/), which provides step-by-step instructions on accessing, configuring, and using a Generative APIs endpoint.

## Are there any rate limits for API usage?
Yes, API rate limits define the maximum number of requests a user can make within a specific time frame to ensure fair access and resource allocation. Refer to our dedicated [documentation](/generative-apis/reference-content/rate-limits/) for more information on rate limits.

## What is the model lifecycle for Generative APIs?
Scaleway is dedicated to updating and offering the latest versions of generative AI models, ensuring improvements in capabilities, accuracy, and safety. As new versions of models are introduced, you can explore them through the Scaleway console. Learn more in our dedicated [documentation](/generative-apis/reference-content/model-lifecycle/).

## What are the SLAs applicable to Generative APIs?
We are currently working on defining our SLAs for Generative APIs. We will provide more information on this topic soon.

## What are the Performance guarantees (vs Managed Inference)?
We are currently working on defining our performance guarantees for Generative APIs. We will provide more information on this topic soon.
