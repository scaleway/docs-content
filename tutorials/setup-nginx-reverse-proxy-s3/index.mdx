## Object Storage Proxy - Overview

Scaleway Object Storage allows you to store unlimited data in [buckets](/storage/object/concepts/#bucket). You can access the data directly via your bucket.

It is possible to access your bucket via an Instance as a proxy using [Nginx](http://nginx.org/) as a reverse proxy to provide read-only access to the bucket's contents.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-object-storage-with-nginx.webp" alt="" />

The request to retrieve a bucket is forwarded to the Object Storage bucket by Nginx when the client sends an HTTP request to the Nginx proxy server. The Object Storage platform replies in delivering the requested object to Nginx, which forwards it to the client requesting the object.

To reduce the load on the bucket and to speed up the delivery of frequently requested objects, it is possible to cache them locally in Nginx.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-nginx-with-cached-data.webp" alt="" />

In this case, an object will be stored temporarily in the cache of Nginx. The client requests an object, and it will be delivered to the client directly from Nginx without forwarding the request to the Object Storage platform.

## Installing Nginx as a reverse proxy

1. Log into your Instance using SSH:
    ```
    ssh root@<your_instance_ip>
    ```
2. Make sure the `apt` repositories as well as the software already installed on the Instance are up to date:
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
3. Install the `nginx` reverse proxy using the `apt` package manager:
    ```
    apt install nginx -y
    ```

## Configuring Nginx as a reverse proxy

1. Open the Nginx configuration file in a text editor:
    ```
    nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    ```
2. Edit the file as follows:
    <Message type="note">
      Remember to replace `s3proxy.mydomain.eu` with the domain name of your Instance and `myobjectstoragebucket.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud` with the URL of your Object Storage bucket.

          proxy_pass             https://$bucket/;
        }

      }
    } 
    ```
    Save the file and exit `nano` once it is edited.
3. Make sure that there are no typos in the Nginx configuration file by syntax checking it using the following command:
    ```
    nginx -t
    ```
4. Restart Nginx to apply the new configuration:
    ```
    service nginx restart
    ```

You can now access the files of your bucket by going directly to `http://s3proxy.mydomain.eu/s3/myfile.txt`, for example. You can also access a cached version after the first retrieval by going to `http://s3proxy.mydomain.eu/s3_cached/myfile.txt`.

## Configuring Nginx as a reverse proxy for HTTPS

Connections to your S3 proxy are currently available in plain, unencrypted HTTP only. It is possible to encrypt the connection between the client and the Nginx proxy by configuring HTTPS. To do so, we will obtain a free SSL certificate issued by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) using [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/), a tool to obtain, manage and renew Let's Encrypt certificates automatically.

1. Add the Certbot repository to apt to download the latest release of the software. Certbot is in active development and it is possible that the packages included in Ubuntu are already outdated.
    ```
    add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
    ```
    Press `Enter` when asked to confirm the action.
2. Install Certbot for Nginx proxy reverse:
    ```
    apt install python3-certbot-nginx -y
    ```
3. Launch the generation of the certificate.
    <Message type="note">
      Replace `<yourdomain.name>` with the domain name of your Instance.
    </Message>

    ```
    certbot --nginx -d <yourdomain.name>
    ```
    When running Certbot for the first time, you will be asked to enter your email address. Confirm it by pressing `Enter` on your keyboard. Once confirmed Certbot will run a challenge and request the certificate.
4. Press `2`, then `Enter` on your keyboard when asked to redirect all traffic to HTTPS.
    ```
    Please choose whether or not to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS, removing HTTP access.

    1: No redirect - Make no further changes to the webserver configuration.
    2: Redirect - Make all requests redirect to secure HTTPS access. Choose this for
    new sites, or if you're confident your site works on HTTPS. You can undo this
    change by editing your web server's configuration.

    Select the appropriate number [1-2] then [enter] (press 'c' to cancel):
    ```

    Certbot will now reconfigure Nginx and once you see the following message your certificate is successfully installed:

    ```
    IMPORTANT NOTES:
    - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
      /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem
      Your key file has been saved at:
      /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem
      Your cert will expire on 2019-04-15. To obtain a new or tweaked
      version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot again
      with the "certonly" option. To non-interactively renew *all* of
      your certificates, run "certbot renew"
    - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
      configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
      secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
      also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
      making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
    - If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:

      Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt:   https://letsencrypt.org/donate
      Donating to EFF:                    https://eff.org/donate-le
    ```

You have now secured the connection between the client and your Nginx proxy using TLS. You can verify it by opening a web browser and going to `https://s3proxy.mydomain.eu/s3/myfile.txt`, for example. The file will be downloaded using an encrypted connection.
