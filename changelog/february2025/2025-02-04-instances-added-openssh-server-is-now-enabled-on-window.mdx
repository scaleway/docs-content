The latest release of **Windows Server 2022** and **Windows Server 2022 Core** images now includes the **OpenSSH Server** and **OpenSSH Client** packages by default.
The **OpenSSH Server** is installed but **disabled by default** for security reasons. To enable it at Instance creation, add the tag `with-ssh` when launching your Instance.
