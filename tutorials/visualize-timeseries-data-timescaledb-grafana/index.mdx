[TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/) is a time series database built on [PostgreSQL](/tutorials/install-postgresql/).  
A time-series database typically stores “time-series data”, as the name indicates. It can be seen as a sequence of data points, that measure the same thing over time and store the measurement results in time order.  
Each of these measurements is paired with a timestamp, defined by a name and a set of labeled dimensions (or “tags”).

Time-series data is everywhere around us and an important part of our everyday life. Whether it is a factory that measures the production output of a specific machine, a farmer observing the humidity of the soil or a city measuring the regularity between trains, all of this is time-series data.

In this tutorial, we use a [Database for PostgreSQL](https://www.scaleway.com/en/database/) with the TimescaleDB extension and a Dataset of the air quality at the [Franklin D. Roosevelt Metro station](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt_(Paris_M%C3%A9tro)>) in Paris, provided by [RATP](https://dataratp2.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/qualite-de-lair-mesuree-dans-la-station-franklin-d-roosevelt/information/), the Parisian transport authority. This kind of data is a perfect example for a time-series database as it monitors certain values over a period of time. Other usages could include data from diverse backgrounds, such as weather data, economic information or productivity information of an assembly line.

4. Enter the name of the new database, in this tutorial we use `airquality`.
5. Click the **Users** tab, followed by **...** and **Update Permissions**.
6. Grant the permissions to the newly created `airquality` database to your user.

## Enabling the TimescaleDB Extension

1. Connect to your Database using the `psql` client:
    ```
    psql -h <rbd_host> --port <rdb_port> -d airquality -U <rdb_user>
    ```

    Enter the password for your database user when prompted.
    <Message type="tip"> 
      Replace `rdb_host` by your Database Instance's IP address and `rdb_port` by the port, which can be found under **Endpoint** on the Database information page. Replace `<rdb_user>` by the name of the user you granted access to `airquality`.
    </Message>

2. Enable the `timescaledb` extension for your database.
    ```
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS timescaledb CASCADE;
    ```

    The following output displays in your terminal:

    ```
    WARNING:

    CREATE EXTENSION
    ```

## Prepare the table for TimescaleDB

1. Create a table called `airquality`, which will be used to store the information.
    ```
    CREATE TABLE airquality(
      DATETIME   TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
      NO         INTEGER,
      NO2        INTEGER,
      PM10       INTEGER,
      CO2        INTEGER,
      TEMP       NUMERIC(4,1),
      HUMI       NUMERIC(4,1)
    );
    ```

    The command above creates a new table called `airquality` with seven columns:

    - `DATETIME` contains a timestamp which includes the time zone.
    - `NO` contains the average [NO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide) concentration in µg/m3.
    - `NO2` contains the average [NO2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_dioxide) concentration in µg/m3.
    - `PM10` contains the average [PM10](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PM10) particles concentration in in µg/m3
    - `CO2` contains the average [CO2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) concentration in ppm.
    - `TEMP` contains the average ambient temperature in °C.
    - `HUMI` contains the relative humidity in %.
2. Convert the table you created into a TimescaleDB [hypertable](https://docs.timescale.com/latest/introduction/architecture/#hypertables).
    ```
    SELECT create_hypertable('airquality', 'datetime');
    ``` 

    The following output displays in the terminal window:

    ```
    airquality=> SELECT create_hypertable('airquality', 'datetime');
        create_hypertable
    -------------------------
    (1,public,airquality,t)
    (1 row)
    ```

## Adding and removing data

1. Add a sample row to the database. The `RETURNING` statement visualizes the data added to the table:
    ```
    INSERT INTO airquality(DATETIME,NO,NO2,PM10,CO2,TEMP,HUMI) VALUES (NOW(),4,38,14,398,27.0,47.4) RETURNING *;
    ```

    An output like the following displays:

    ```
              datetime            | no | no2 | pm10 | co2 | temp | humi
    -------------------------------+----+-----+------+-----+------+------
    2019-12-10 15:31:28.116471+00 |  4 |  38 |   14 | 398 | 27.0 | 47.4
    (1 row)

    INSERT 0 1
    ```
2. Remove the data from the table. The following command deletes all data where the value for `temp` is larger than `26`:
    ```
    DELETE FROM airquality WHERE temp > 26;
    DELETE 1
    ```

    Run a [garbage collection](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-vacuum.html) using the `VACCUM` command to clean up the table and to free unused space:

    ```
    VACUUM airquality;
    ```

    Manually adding data works for a small scale database, but when it comes to deal with time-scale data you have large sets of data.

### Importing the dataset

In this tutorial, we use an [air quality dataset](https://dataratp2.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/qualite-de-lair-mesuree-dans-la-station-franklin-d-roosevelt/information/) from a Parisian metro station. The data is provided by Paris' transport authority [RATP](https://dataratp2.opendatasoft.com/explore/?sort=modified).

1. [Download](https://dataratp.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/qualite-de-lair-mesuree-dans-la-station-franklin-d-roosevelt/export/) the sample data in CSV-format on your local computer.
2. Convert the downloaded CSV file into a SQL database file:
    ```
    cat qualite-de-lair-mesuree-dans-la-station-franklin-d-roosevelt.csv | awk -F';' '{ printf "INSERT INTO airquality(DATETIME,NO,NO2,PM10,CO2,TEMP,HUMI) VALUES (\x27%s\x27,\x27%s\x27,\x27%s\x27,\x27%s\x27,\x27%s\x27,\x27%s\x27,\x27%s\x27);",$1,$2,$3,$4,$5,$6,$7;print ""}' > airquality.sql
    ```
3. Import the file to your database:
    ```
    psql -h <rbd_host> --port <rdb_port> -d airquality -U <rdb_user> < airquality.sql
    ```

## Querying Data

Now as you have a large dataset available, you can query the data using the `psql` client.

1. Connect to your database.
    ```
    psql -h <rbd_host> --port <rdb_port> -d airquality -U <rdb_user>
    ```
2. To receive a list of the 10 most recent entries in the database run the following command.
    ```
    SELECT * FROM airquality ORDER BY datetime DESC LIMIT 10;
    ```

    A list like the following displays:

    ```
            datetime        | no | no2 | pm10 | co2 | temp | humi
    ------------------------+----+-----+------+-----+------+------
    2019-12-02 00:00:00+00 | 12 |  42 |   25 |     | 14.8 | 36.3
    2019-12-01 23:00:00+00 | 11 |  40 |   23 |     | 15.0 | 36.6
    2019-12-01 22:00:00+00 | 14 |  42 |   23 |     | 15.0 | 38.1
    2019-12-01 21:00:00+00 | 29 |  48 |   26 |     | 14.4 | 41.7
    2019-12-01 20:00:00+00 | 21 |  43 |   30 |     | 13.9 | 42.3
    2019-12-01 19:00:00+00 | 18 |  40 |   31 |     | 14.1 | 42.3
    2019-12-01 18:00:00+00 | 17 |  40 |   29 |     | 14.2 | 41.8
    2019-12-01 17:00:00+00 | 16 |  39 |   27 |     | 14.6 | 40.9
    2019-12-01 16:00:00+00 | 15 |  40 |   26 |     | 15.0 | 41.4
    2019-12-01 15:00:00+00 | 13 |  40 |   20 |     | 14.8 | 41.8
    (10 rows)
    ```
3. Run the following command to retrieve the average temperature on all data:
    ```
    SELECT percentile_cont(0.5)
      WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY temp)
      FROM airquality;
    ```

    An output like the following displays:

    ```
    percentile_cont
    -----------------
              18.7
    (1 row)
    ```

For more information on how to read data from your database, refer to TimescaleDB's [read data documentation page](https://docs.timescale.com/latest/using-timescaledb/reading-data).

## Visualizing data with Grafana

You can visualize the time-series data by creating a dashboard using [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), an open source analytics & monitoring solution.

1. Create a new [Instance](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/) running on Ubuntu Bionic (18.04) from your [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/dashboard)
2. Log into the Instance [using SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).
3. Add the Grafana repository to the `apt` packet cache.
    ```
    add-apt-repository "deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main"
    ```
4. Install the GPG key of Grafana to validate the packages.
    ```
    wget -q -O - https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | apt-key add -
    ```
5. Update the `apt` packet cache.
    ```
    apt update
    ```
6. Install Grafana using `apt`.
    ```
    apt install grafana
    ```
7. Reload the `systemd` daemon, enable the Grafana service to start the application automatically during system boot and start the application manually.
    ```
    systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl enable grafana-server.service && systemctl start grafana-server.service
    ```
8. Open a web browser and point it to `http://<instance_ip>:3000/`.
    <Message type="note">
      Replace `<instance_ip>` with the IP address of your Instance.
    </Message>
9. The Grafana login screen displays. Log yourself into Grafana using the username and password `admin`:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-grafana_login.webp" alt="" />

    Upon the first connection, you will be asked to set a new password.
10. Enter it twice and validate the form. The default dashbard displays.
11. Click **Add Datasource** to configure a new datasource.
12. Enter the credentials of your Database Instance:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-grafana_db.webp" alt="" />

    - **Host**: Enter the IP address and the port of your Database Instance seperated by a double-point.
    - **Managed Databases**: The name of the database (for example `airquality`)
    - **User**: The database user
    - **Password**: The database password
    - **SSL Mode**: The desired SSL validation mode. Set the value to `required`.
    - **Version**: This value must correspond to the PostgreSQL version of your Database Instance
    - **TimescaleDB**: Enable this value
13. Click **Save & Test** to test the database connection and to save the values.
14. Click the Grafana logo to return to the base dashboard.
15. Create a JSON configuration to query the database in Grafana.
16. Click **+ Create** > **Import** and click **Import .json File** to upload the previously downloaded configuration file to Grafana.

    Grafana starts to generate graphs from the time-series data stored in TimescaleDB. You can now browse the data in a visual interface and edit the queries of the database according to your needs:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-grafana_dashboard.webp" alt="" />

## Conclusion

You now have configured a Timescale database, imported time-series data, learned how to query, modify and visualize the data using Grafana. For more information about TimescaleDB, refer to the [official Documentation](https://docs.timescale.com/).
