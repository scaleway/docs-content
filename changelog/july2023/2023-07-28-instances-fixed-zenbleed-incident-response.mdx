We have successfully mitigated the Zenbleed vulnerability affecting AMD processors across our DEV1, GP1, and VC Instance offerings. The patching process has been completed, and all impacted Instances have been updated. While the security issue has been addressed, it is possible that some users may notice minor performance impacts. For further information, please refer to our [blog post](https://www.scaleway.com/en/blog/zenbleed-vulnerability/).
