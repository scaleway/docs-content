**Alpine Quantum Technologies (AQT)** is an Austrian quantum computing company spin-off from the University of Innsbruck. They specialize in **trapped-ion** quantum computers, a technology renowned for its exceptional gate fidelity and long coherence times.

Unlike superconducting qubits which rely on printed circuits, AQT uses individual calcium ions confined in a vacuum trap as qubits. This approach allows for a unique feature: **all-to-all connectivity**. Any qubit can talk to any other qubit directly, simplifying circuit design and reducing the need for noisy SWAP gates.

## IBEX-Q1: The Universal Trapped-Ion QPU

The **IBEX-Q1** (specifically the `QPU-IBEX-12PQ` platform on Scaleway) is AQT's general-purpose quantum processor.

### Key Features
* **All-to-all Connectivity:** The ions are arranged in a linear chain but controlled by lasers that can entangle any pair. This massively reduces circuit depth for complex algorithms like QAOA or QML.
* **High Fidelity:** Trapped ions offer some of the lowest error rates in the industry for 2-qubit gates.
* **Room Temperature Operation:** The system fits in standard rack cabinets and does not require the massive dilution refrigerators needed for superconducting qubits.

### Use Cases
Thanks to its connectivity, the IBEX QPU is particularly well suited for:
* **Combinatorial Optimization:** Problems where variables are highly interdependent (Finance, Logistics).
* **Quantum Simulation:** Simulating complex molecules where entanglement structure is dense.
* **Deep Circuits:** Algorithms requiring long computation times before decoherence sets in.

## Qiskit: The Industry Standard SDK

**Qiskit** is an open-source software development kit (SDK) widely used to program quantum computers. Originally developed by IBM, it has become a standard language for the quantum ecosystem.

It allows you to:
* **Build** quantum circuits using Python.
* **Transpile** (optimize) them for specific hardware.
* **Execute** them on various backends (simulators or real QPUs).

On Scaleway QaaS, we provide a dedicated provider `qiskit-scaleway` that allows you to use standard Qiskit code to target AQT's hardware seamlessly.

## Accessing AQT via Scaleway QaaS

Scaleway acts as a bridge, allowing you to run Qiskit circuits directly on AQT's machines hosted in Innsbruck, or on their digital twins (emulators) hosted on Scaleway's GPU clusters.

### 1. Prerequisites

* A Scaleway account with a valid **Project ID**.
* A Scaleway **API Key** (Secret Key).
* Python installed with the `qiskit-scaleway` package.

### 2. Installation

Install the official Scaleway provider for Qiskit:

```bash
pip install qiskit-scaleway
