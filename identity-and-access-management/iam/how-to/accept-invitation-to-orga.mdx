When you [create a Scaleway account](/console/my-account/how-to/create-an-account), an Organization is automatically created, of which you are the [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner). If you are invited to a someone else's Organization, you will simultaneously be the Owner of your own Organization and a guest in the other Organization, where you will have the rights and permissions granted to you via [policies](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#policy).

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have been invited to join an [Organization](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#organization)
</Message>

When someone invites you to join their Organization, you receive an email to inform you.

1. Click **Accept Invitation** from your email invitation. The Scaleway console opens in a browser window. A pop-up displays introducing you to the Organization.
2. Click **Next** to proceed. 
    You may be prompted to try creating a resource or viewing the [default Project](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#organization). You can choose to try these actions out, or simply close the window.

    You are now an [IAM user](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#user) of the Organization which you were invited to join. 

    Always ensure that you are in the desired Organization at any time by checking the Organization name that displays in the top right corner of your console. In the image below, we are currently in the Marie Curie Organization (highlighted in red). Use the drop-down menu to navigate to a different Organization, for example below we could switch to the Pierre Curie Organization.

    <Message type="note">
      If you receive an invitation to join an Organization and you don't already have a [Scaleway account](/console/my-account/how-to/create-an-account/), you will be prompted to create one.
