| Memory    | 2048 MB        |

## Architecture

Scaleway Serverless Jobs only supports `amd64` architecture for images.

For example, if you build an image using an ARM CPU, such as Apple Silicon, your image will be in the `arm64` architecture, and you will have an error message during deployment.

You must ensure to build your image to target `amd64` architecture.
