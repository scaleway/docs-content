This page shows you how to create [tokens](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#tokens), to grant other cloud providersâ€™ services and platforms access to your [Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#cockpit).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Activated your [Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/how-to/activate-cockpit)
- [Activated traces](/observability/cockpit/how-to/activate-push-traces) if you want to create a token to push [traces](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#traces)

1. Click **Cockpit** in the Observability section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Cockpit** overview page displays.
2. Click the **APIs and Tokens** tab.
3. Click **Generate token** to create a token. A pop-up displays prompting you to create a token.
4. Choose a name for your token or use the already-generated name.
5. Select the permissions you wish to apply to your token.
    <Message type="important">
    You must select at least one permission.
    Permissions include:
    - **Push**: allows you to send your metrics, logs, and traces to your Cockpit.
    - **Query**: allows you to fetch your metrics, logs, and traces from your Cockpit.
    - **Rules**: allow you to configure alerting and recording rules.
    - **Alerts**: allow you to set up the alert manager.
    </Message>
6. Click **Generate token** to generate your token. A pop-up displays with your secret key.

    <Message type="important">
    Make sure to save your secret key before closing the pop-up.
    </Message>

Your newly-created token displays in the list of your tokens.

<Message type="important">
 - Having the default configuration on your agents might lead to more of your resources' metrics being sent, a high consumption and a high bill at the end of the month.
 - Sending metrics and logs for Scaleway resources or personal data using an external path is a billable feature. In addition, any data that you push yourself is billed, even if you send data from Scaleway products. Refer to the [product pricing](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/?tags=available,managedservices-observability-cockpit) for more information.
