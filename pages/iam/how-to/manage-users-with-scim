**S**ystem for **C**ross-domain **I**dentity **Management** - also known as **SCIM**, is a standard protocol for exchanging user identity and authorization data between an Identity Provider and a Service Provider. 

Combined with [SAML](/iam/how-to/set-up-identity-federation), it allows IAM managers to fully manager User management through the Identity Provider:
- SAML is used for members to log in, by authentication on their Identity Provider with the related authentication policies 
- SCIM is used to automatically create, update, (un)lock and delete users on Scaleway based on the actions performed on the user directory on the Identity Provider side

<Message type="important">
  Only SCIM user-related actions are currently supported by Scaleway. Group auto-provisioning is planned to be available in the coming months.
</Message>

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to access the SCIM configuration section

1. Click **Settings** on the top-right of the Organization Dashboard. The  [Organization settings](https://console.scaleway.com/settings) display. Alternatively, click **Settings** on the top-right drop-down menu of the Scaleway console
2. Click the **Automatic user provisioning (SCIM)** button. The SCIM-related section displays


## How to activate SCIM

From the SCIM Configuration section, you can enable SCIM for the Organization.


1. Click on **Enable**. A pop-up displays to inform you that a token creation is needed to activate SCIM.

2. Click the **Enable SCIM and create token** button. SCIM is now enabled for the Organization and two fields are displayed:
- **A SCIM token**, to be used by the Identity Provider to authenticate to Scaleway to perform the needed actions. This token is **sensitive** and should not be shared to anyone. It will only be displayed once by the console.
- **A base URL**, for the Identity Provider to connect to Scaleway.

3. Click on **Close**. The configuration is complete on Scaleway side, but you need now to configure SCIM on your Identity provider. 

Both base URL and SCIM token need to be communicated to your Identity Provider using their SCIM configuration interface. Make sure both fields are used during the configuration as any provider will need it to provision users on Scaleway. Depending on the provider, you may be benefit from a test interface to make sure that the configuration is correct.

<Message type="note">
      To ensure the correct configuration of SCIM, you can perform an action on your Identity Provider (changing a name, creating a new user). You should then see:
      - The impacts reflected on [your users](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users)
      - The update events appearing on your [Audit Trail in the Paris region](https://console.scaleway.com/audit-trail/fr-par/events)
    </Message>

<Message type="important">
      All users created prior to the SCIM configuration, and not present in the Identity Provider directory, will not be impacted by the SCIM configuration and cannot be updated or deleted. If these users must be managed by SCIM, they must be re-created on the Identity Provider side.
    </Message>



## How to rotate the SCIM token

At any moment, your SCIM configuration can have up to two active tokens. From the SCIM Configuration section, you can create a second token.

1. Click on **Generate token** to create a second token
2. Follow the same steps as during the [first SCIM activation](/iam/how-to/manage-users-with-scim/#how-to-activate-scim) - don't forget to replace the former SCIM token by the new one on your Identity provider
3. Make sure the SCIM configuration is still working

<Message type="note">
      SCIM tokens have a time-to-live of 1 year. When a token is expired, it cannot be used to provision users, and a new token must be created. 
    </Message>

## How to deactivate SCIM

1. Click the **Disable** button on top of the Automatic user provisioning (SCIM) section
2. Type **Disable** to confirm.
    <Message type="important">
      - If automatic user provisioning with SCIM is disabled on Scaleway, your Identity Provider will not be able to perform any actions on Users, even if the configuration is correctly done on this side.
