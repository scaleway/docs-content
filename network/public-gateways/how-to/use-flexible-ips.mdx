This page shows you how to use [flexible IP addresses](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#flexible-ip/) with your Public Gateways.

Flexible IP addresses are public IPs that you can hold independently of any Public Gateway, and attach and detach to/from any of your Public Gateways as you wish. You can keep a number of flexible IP addresses in your account at any given time.

<Message type="important">
  This how-to concerns the creation of Public Gateway flexible IPs. For the creation of [Instance flexible IPs](/compute/instances/how-to/use-flexips/) or [Elastic Metal flexible IPs](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/configure-flexible-ip/), refer to the relevant documentation. Note that each set of flexible IPs is independent, and can only be used with that product. Instance flexible IPs cannot be attached to Public Gateways and vice versa. Public Gateway flexible IPs are scoped to a single Availability Zone.
