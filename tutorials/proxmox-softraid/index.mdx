## Proxmox - Overview

Proxmox Virtual Environment - or Proxmox VE is a server virtualization platform, based on Debian Linux. It allows the deployment of management of [KVM-based](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page/) virtual machines or [LXC](https://linuxcontainers.org/) containers.

The tool provides a REST-API as well as a graphical web interface to manage the virtual machines and is licensed under the [GNU Affero General Public License, version 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.de.html/).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [Dedibox](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/) with [KVM-over-IP](/dedibox/kvm-over-ip/concepts/#kvm-over-ip) access

## Installing Proxmox

1. Create a [KVM-over-IP](/dedibox/kvm-over-ip/quickstart/) session from your [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net/).
2. Mount the Proxmox ISO, available on the server [virtualmedia.online.net](http://virtualmedia.online.net/). The mounting procedure may differ slightly depending on the KVM module of your Dedibox. The instructions for Proxmox VE 6 can be found [here](https://virtualmedia.online.net/proxmox/proxmox-ve_6.0-1.iso/).
3. Boot the server from the ISO file by choosing the virtual CD-ROM drive in the boot options.
4. The Proxmox [EULA](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html/) displays. Agree to it by clicking **I agree**. A summary of the Proxmox installer displays.

5. Click **Options** at the bottom of the page.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_installer-02.webp" width="550" alt="" />
6. Choose the RAID level for Proxmox. To mirror the data on both drives, choose **zfs (RAID1)**, then click **Next** to continue with the installation.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_installer-03.webp" width="350" alt="" />
7. Enter the Location of your Server and select the timezone to use, then click **Next**.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_installer-04.webp" width="550" alt="" />
8. Enter a strong administration password with at least eight characters and its confirmation, and a contact email address. Proxmox will send important notifications to this email address, so make sure it is valid. Once all set, click **Next**.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_installer-06.webp" width="550" alt="" />
9. Configure the **Management Network**. This will be the network interface on which the Proxmox web interface and APIs are available. We recommend you configure it on the primary email address of your Dedibox.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_installer-07.webp" width="550" alt="" />

    The network configuration should look as follows:
      - **Management Interface**: The first network interface of your machine (i.e. `eno1`)
      - **Hostname (FQDN)**: A fully qualified domain name for your host (i.e. `proxmox.mydomain.com`)
      - **IP Address**: The main IP address of your Dedibox (i.e. `62.210.16.37`)
      - **Netmask**: The netmask of the subnet: `255.255.255.0`
      - **Gateway**: The Gateway for the machine. It is available on your server's main IP ending on `.1` (i.e. `62.210.16.1`)
      - **DNS Server**: The resolving DNS server to use (i.e. `51.159.47.28` or `51.159.47.26`)
  
    A summary of the configuration displays.
10. Verify that all parameters are correct and click **Install** to launch the installation.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_installer-08.webp" width="550" alt="" />

  Once the installation is complete, a confirmation displays.
11. Click **Reboot** to reboot the server before accessing the Proxmox web interface:

## Accessing Proxmox

Once the server has rebooted, the Proxmox web interface is available.

1. Open a web browser and go to `https://your_scaleway_dedibox:8006/`. The login displays. Enter your credentials and click **Login**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_login.webp" width="550" alt="" />

    Enter the following credentials to log in:

      - **User Name**: `root`
      - **Password**: The password set during the installation of Proxmox
      - **Realm**: `Linux PAM standard authentication`
      - **Language**: The display language of the Proxmox interface (i.e. `English`)

    The Proxmox dashboard displays.
2. Continue to deploy and manage virtual machines.
