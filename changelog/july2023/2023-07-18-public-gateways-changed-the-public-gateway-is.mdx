With the release of VPC in GA, Public Gateway no longer supports the DHCP server.
Public Gateway now focuses on its primary functions such as:
- Internet access: allowing external traffic to access the internal resources of a Private Network
- NAT-Gateway: distributing requests to the right IP addresses
- SSH Bastion: allowing and monitoring SSH connections
- Local DNS server: customizing resources name on the Private Network
