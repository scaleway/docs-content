import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'

[Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/) is a lightweight, high-performance web framework for Go, ideal for building fast APIs and web applications with minimal overhead. Hosting Gin apps on [Scaleway Serverless Containers](/serverless-containers/) provides automatic scaling, simplified deployment, and reduced infrastructure management. This deployment method enables your application to efficiently handle varying workloads, optimize resource usage, and lets you focus on writing code and building features rather than maintaining servers.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Installed [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) or [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Created a Scaleway Container Registry namespace](/container-registry/how-to/create-namespace/) and [logged into it](/container-registry/how-to/connect-docker-cli/)
- [Installed go 1.23 or newer](https://go.dev/doc/install)


## Create and host a basic Go Gin web application

To host a [Go](https://go.dev/) web application using the [Gin framework](https://gin-gonic.com/) on **Scaleway Serverless Containers**, you need to create a simple Go project, define HTTP handlers, and containerize it using a production-ready `Dockerfile`. After building the container image locally, push it to the [Scaleway Container Registry](/container-registry/) and deploy it via [Scaleway Serverless Containers](/serverless-containers/).

Gin is a lightweight, high-performance web framework for Go, ideal for building fast APIs and web apps with minimal overhead.

### Create your app and test it locally

1. In a terminal, create a new directory and navigate into it:
    ```bash
    mkdir my-gin-app
    cd my-gin-app
    ```

2. Initialize a Go module:
    ```bash
    go mod init my-gin-app
    ```

3. Create a `main.go` file, then add the code below to it to create a basic Gin server:
    ```go
    package main

    import "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"

    func main() {
        r := gin.Default()
        r.LoadHTMLGlob("templates/*")

        r.GET("/", func(c *gin.Context) {
            c.HTML(200, "index.html", nil)
        })

        r.Run("0.0.0.0:8080")
    }
    ```

4. Create a `templates` folder to store HTTP files.

    ```bash
    mkdir templates
    ```

5. Create an `index.html` file in the `templates` folder, then add the code below to it:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/>
      <title>Hello</title>
      <style>
        body {
          font-family: sans-serif;
          text-align: center;
          margin: 0;
          padding: 100px 20px;
          background: #fafafa;
          color: #333;
        }
      </style>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>Hello from Gin ðŸŒ¿</h1>
      <p>A minimal page, fast and clean, running on Scaleway Serverless Containers.</p>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

6. Run the following command to install the Gin package:
    ```bash
    go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin
    ```

7. Test the app locally:
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```
    Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see the homepage of your web app.

### Build the app image and push it to Scaleway Container Registry

Before building and pushing your image, ensure you have [created a Scaleway Container Registry namespace](/container-registry/how-to/create-namespace/), and [logged into it with the Docker CLI](/container-registry/how-to/connect-docker-cli/).

1. Create a `Dockerfile` at the root of your project:
    ```dockerfile
    # Use a lightweight Go image for building
    FROM golang:1.25-alpine AS builder

    # Set working directory
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy go mod files
    COPY go.mod go.sum ./
    RUN go mod download

    # Copy source code
    COPY . .

    # Build the Go binary
    RUN go build -o main .

    # Final stage: minimal image
    FROM alpine:latest

    # Install CA certificates
    RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates

    # Set working directory
    WORKDIR /root/

    # Copy binary from builder stage
    COPY --from=builder /app/main .

    # Expose port
    EXPOSE 8080

    # Run the binary
    CMD ["./main"]
    ```

2. Build, tag, and push the image to Scaleway Container Registry:
    ```bash
    docker build \
      --platform linux/amd64 \
      --push \
      -t <CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT>/my-gin-app:latest .
    ```

    <Message type="note">
    You can find your Container Registry endpoint in the **Settings** tab of your Container Registry namespace in the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/registry/namespaces).
    </Message>

### Deploy your app using Serverless Containers

1. [Deploy a Serverless Container](/serverless-containers/how-to/deploy-container/) with the following settings:
    - **Registry**: Scaleway Container Registry
    - **Registry namespace**: The namespace where you pushed your image
    - **Container port**: `8080` (matches the port in the Go app and Dockerfile)
    - **Resources**: `250 mVCPU` and `256 MB` memory (Go apps are lightweight)
    - **Autoscaling**: Set minimum scale to `1` to avoid [cold starts](/serverless-containers/concepts/#cold-start) (optional)

    Deployment may take up to a minute.

2. Once the container is **ready**, click the **container endpoint** in the **Overview** tab. Your Gin app will be live and accessible to anyone with the link.

## Going further

- You can deploy an existing Go Gin project by building and pushing its container image as shown above.
- [Add a custom domain](/serverless-containers/how-to/add-a-custom-domain-to-a-container/) to your deployed app.
- Secure your app with HTTPS â€” Scaleway automatically provides TLS for container endpoints.
