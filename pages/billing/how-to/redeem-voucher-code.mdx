A Scaleway voucher provides you with a discount or credit to use on our services. You can receive it as part of a promotional campaign or from your account manager. To redeem a voucher, you need to [create a Scaleway account](/account/how-to/create-an-account/).

Voucher codes are unique and valid only for a defined period.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) that allow you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid payment method added to your account.


## How to apply a voucher

## Understanding voucher scopes
Vouchers provide discounts or credits to use on our services. However, certain conditions and exclusions apply to their usage.

### Inclusive and exclusive vouchers
- **Incl. (Inclusive)**: The voucher applies only to the products or services listed after "Incl." (e.g., "Incl. PRO2," means that the voucher only applies to PRO2 Instances).

- **Excl. (Exclusive)**: The voucher cannot be applied to the products or services listed after "Excl." (e.g., "Excl. Apple Silicon" means that the voucher does not apply to Apple Silicon machines).

### Fees excluded from vouchers
Some fees are always excluded from voucher applicability:

- **Elastic Metal commitment fees**: These are fixed costs for reserving Elastic Metal servers and cannot be covered by vouchers.

- **Domain names**: Fees for registering, renewing, or managing domain names are not eligible for voucher use.
