Scaleway Object Storage allows you to create [bucket policies](/storage/object/concepts/#bucket-policy) directly from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com). 

To create and apply a bucket policy from the AWS CLI, refer to the [dedicated documentation](/storage/object/api-cli/create-bucket-policy/).

<Macro id="storage-bucket-policy" />

<Macro id="requirements" />
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)

## How to create a bucket policy

1. Click **Object Storage** on the left side menu of the console. The Object Storage dashboard displays.

2. Click the **Bucket policies** tab, then click **+ Create bucket policy**. A creation form displays.

3. Enter a name for your bucket policy.

4. Select the bucket to which you want to apply the policy.

    <Message type="note">
    - You can only apply a policy to a single bucket, but you can [duplicate an existing policy](/storage/object/how-to/create-bucket-policy/#how-to-apply-an-existing-policy-to-another-bucket) and apply it to another bucket.
    - If you change the target bucket of an existing policy, the bucket policy will be removed from the original bucket, and applied to the selected bucket.
    </Message>

5. Select your preferred creation method:

    - The **policy generator** to add [statements](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/#statement) using a form.
    
    - The **JSON editor** to manually write or paste your bucket policy in a code editor.

    <Message type="note">
    Refer to the dedicated documentation on [bucket policies overview](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/) and [combining IAM and bucket policies](/storage/object/api-cli/combining-iam-and-object-storage/) for more information on how to build a bucket policy.
    </Message>

6.  Keep the **Maintain access to bucket** box ticked to prevent accidental lockout from your bucket. By default, the bucket policy contains a **secure statement** that allows every action to the user creating the policy.

7. Create a [statement](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/#statement) by entering the following information:

    <Tabs id="create-bucket-policy">
    <TabsTab label="Policy generator">
        - Enter a unique [statement ID](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/#sid) (also called **Sid**) describing the purpose of the statement.
        - Select the types of [principals](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/#principal) of your bucket policy from the drop-down menu.
        - Select the **users** and **applications** you want to grant access to.
        - Select the [Actions](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/#action) to allow to the principal(s). 
            <Message type="tip">
            To allow different action sets to the different principals, create multiple statements.
            </Message>
        - Select [resources](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/#resource) by entering the prefix of the objects, followed by `/*`. Enter `*` to select every object in the bucket.
        - Add [conditions](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/#condition) by selecting by selecting them from the drop-down menu, and adding a supported key-value pair.
    </TabsTab>
    <TabsTab label="JSON editor">
        - Enter a unique [statement ID](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/#sid) (also called **Sid**) describing the purpose of the statement.
        - Enter the types of [principals](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/#principal) and the user/application ID you want to grant access as shown below:

              ]
          },
          ```
