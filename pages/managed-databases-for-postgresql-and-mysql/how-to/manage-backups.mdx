## How to create manual backups

Manual backups are useful in cases when you need to have a backup of a specific state of the Database Instance. They can be created for all Database Instances with Local Storage.

You can create manual backups for Database Instances with Block Storage if the Database Instance storage is **inferior or equal to 585 GB**.

1. Click the **Backups** tab on your selected Database Instance's information page.
2. Click **Create backup**.
3. Enter a **name** for the backup, choose the database and set an expiration date for the backup to be removed automatically.
    <Message type="note">
      You can click <Icon name="more" /> > **Edit** to change the name and expiration anytime.
    </Message>
4. Click **Create backup** to launch the backup process for the database.

## How to restore backups

1. Click the **Backups** tab on your selected Database Instance's information page.
2. Click <Icon name="more" />, then **Restore** next to the name of the backup you want to restore. A pop-up displays.
4. Select the Database Instance and the database to which you wish to restore the backup. Two options are available:
    - Restoring to the original database. This will restore the backup to the same database.
    - Restoring to a new database. If you select this option, you must set a name for your new database.
5. Click **Restore backup**.
    <Message type="note">
      Large database backups can take up to several hours to restore.

## How to export backups

1. Click the **Backups** tab on your selected Database Instance's information page.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the name of the backup you want to export.
3. Click **Prepare export**. Once the export is prepared, the **Download** button displays.
4. Click **Download**.

      PostgreSQL backups are exported in the PostgreSQL compression format. MySQL backups are compressed in `.gzip`.

## How to delete backups

When you delete a Database Instance, the backups and snapshots created with the autobackup feature are not automatically deleted.
Automatic backups can be manually deleted or will be purged after the retention period defined in the backup schedule configuration.

1. Click the **Backups** tab on your selected Database Instance's information page.
2. Select the backup you wish to delete.
3. Click <Icon name="more" /> >**Delete**
4. Click **Delete backup** to confirm.
