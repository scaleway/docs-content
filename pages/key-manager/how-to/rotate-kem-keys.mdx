Key rotation is a critical security practice that ensures that encryption keys are not reused for extended periods of time. Regularly rotating keys helps limit the number of messages encrypted with the same key version.

This reduces the risk of exposure if a key is compromised, thus enhancing the overall security and resilience of your system. For symmetric encryption, it is generally recommended to rotate keys every 30 to 90 days.

## How to rotate keys

1. Click Key Manager in the **Security and Identity section** of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. Your keys display.
2. Click the key you want to rotate. Your key's **Overview** tab displays.
3. Scroll down to the **Key rotation** section, and click **Rotate key**. A tooltip displays to confirm the rotation was performed.
    <Message type="note">
     Rotating your key creates a new version of it. All cryptographic operations will use the new key rotation. All data encrypted with former key versions will remain decipherable with the former key.
    </Message>
4. Check that your key was rotated under the **Current rotation** field in the **Key information** section.
