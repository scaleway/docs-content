Managed Document Databases provide fully-managed document Database Instances, with FerretDB as a database engine.

Document databases enable users to store and retrieve data in a document format, such as `json`. Compared to traditional relational databases where data is stored in a table-like format, document-type storage supports storing multiple nested keys and values in each document key.

## How to create a database

1. Click **MongoDB™** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu, if you do not have a Database Instance already created, the creation page displays.
2. Click **Create a Database Instance**. The creation wizard displays.
3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Select ** MongoDB™** as a database engine.
    - Choose a region. This is the geographical location where your database will be deployed.
    - Select a database configuration. You can choose between:
        - **Replica-set 1-node** - an instance of MongoDB™ that runs as a single server and does not provide redundancy or high availability.
        - **Replica-set 3-nodes** - a group of 3 MongoDB™ servers (1 primary and 2 standby nodes) that maintain the same data set. Replica sets provide redundancy and high availability and are the basis for all production deployments. If the main node fails for any reason, one of the remaining standby nodes is assigned and can take over requests, reducing downtime.
    - Select a node type.
    - Define the size of your Block Storage volume. You can increase your storage space without changing your node type, with no downtime. You can increase your volume to up to 10 TB.
    - Add a name and set a password for your user.
    <Message type="important">
    Your username must adhere to specific criteria.
      - Length must be between 1 and 63 characters
      - First character must be an alphabetic character (**a-Za-Z**)
      - It can not start with **_rdb**
      - Only **a-zA-Z0-9_$-** characters are accepted
    </Message>
    - Enter a name for your Database Instance.
4. Click **Create a Database Instance** to confirm your choices and launch creation.

    You are taken to the **Overview** tab for your Database Instance, where you can see information including the **Endpoint** to enable you to connect to it.
