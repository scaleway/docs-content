## Boot process

EM-RV1 servers do not support standard UEFI or BIOS boot, therefore the boot
process might slightly differ from other servers. At boot, the bootloader
expects the eMMC to be partitioned as GPT, and will look for a `boot.itb` file
in the first or second partition. The partition that contains this boot file
must be formatted as FAT32.

This `boot.itb` file is in fact a [FIT
Image](https://docs.u-boot.org/en/latest/usage/fit/source_file_format.html)
that must contain the following sections:

  - **kernel**: A Linux kernel image.
  - **fdt**: A [device tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devicetree).
  - **opensbi**: The SBI as defined by [RISC-V SBI
      specification](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-sbi-doc/).
  - **env**: A text-based environment file that defines the following keys:
      - `usr_bootargs`: Command-line arguments to pass to the kernel.
      - `usr_has_ramdisk`: Set to `1` if we should load the ramdisk from the FIT
        image.
  - **ramdisk** (optional): A ramdisk image.

The following section will explain in details how to create your own boot FIT image.

## Boot a custom kernel

In this section, you will build a boot image based off a close-to-mainline
Linux kernel.

  Mainline Linux is not fully compatible with EM-RV1 servers yet.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- Installed an EM-RV1 server with Ubuntu
- Proficient knowledge of Linux systems
- A few hours of availability to build a Linux kernel

1. Connect to your EM-RV1 server using SSH.
2. Install the build dependencies.
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y \
      autoconf bc bison dwarves flex gawk git make \
      libelf-dev libssl-dev \
      u-boot-tools device-tree-compiler
    ```
3. Clone the projects to build.
    ```bash
    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/revyos/th1520-linux-kernel.git linux
    git clone https://github.com/revyos/thead-opensbi.git opensbi
    git clone https://github.com/scaleway/em-rv1.git
    ```
4. Build the Linux kernel.
    ```bash
    cd linux/
    make revyos_defconfig
    # This can take several hours.
    make -j
    sudo make modules_install
    cd ..
    ```
5. Build OpenSBI.
   ```bash
   cd opensbi/
   make PLATFORM=generic -j
   cd ..
   ```
6. Build and install the FIT image.
   ```bash
   cd em-rv1/fit/

   # Build the device tree
   cpp \
    -nostdinc \
    -I ../linux/arch/riscv/boot/dts/thead/ \
    -I ../linux/include/ \
    -undef \
    -x assembler-with-cpp \
    em-rv1-c4m16s128-a.dts \
    | dtc -o em-rv1-c4m16s128-a.dtb

   # Build the FIT image
   sudo mv /boot/boot.itb /boot/boot.itb.bak
   sudo mkimage -f em-rv1-c4m16s128-a-boot.its /boot/boot.itb

   cd -
   ```
7. Reboot the server to load the new kernel.

## Update the kernel

Due to hardware specificities, it is not possible to use the kernel provided by
major Linux distributions directly on EM-RV1 servers. Instead, we provide a
custom upgrade channel. Follow the steps below to update your kernel:

1. [Reboot your EM-RV1 server in rescue mode](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/use-rescue-mode/).
2. Log into the machine over SSH using the `rescue` user.
3. Update the kernel:
    ```bash
    sudo rv1 update-kernel
    ```

    <Message type="note">
    If you prefer to run a more recent Linux kernel instead of the
    vendor-provided kernel, you can append the `--tree mainline` option.

    Although we do not recommend it, you can also enable support for vector
    instructions with the `--enable-vector` flag. Be aware that this feature
    implements an unratified version of RISC-V vector instructions (RVV 0.7.1)
    which requires specific development efforts.

    For a comprehensive list of options, refer to `rv1 update-kernel --help`.
    </Message>
4. Wait for the update to complete. This step can take a few minutes.
5. Reboot the server in normal mode.

<Message type="note">
If you are updating from kernel version `5.10.113-scw0` or lower, note that
newer kernels disable vector instructions by default. Refer to the process above if you still wish to keep them enabled.

## Android

### Remote access

This guide will help you get a remote access on the Android distribution
installed on your EM-RV1 server.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- Installed [Android Platform
  tools](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools) on your
  local machine
- Installed [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy#get-the-app) on your
  local machine
- Installed the Android image on your EM-RV1 server

1. Open a SSH tunnel to the ADB daemon running on your server:
   ```bash
   ssh -L '5555:localhost:5555' root@<your server IP address>
   ```
   Make sure you keep this session open in the background during the next
   steps.
2. In a new local shell, connect your local ADB client to the remote daemon
   through the SSH tunnel you created in the previous step:
   ```bash
   adb connect localhost:5555
   ```
3. Start a `scrcpy` session on this ADB session:
   ```bash
   scrcpy -s localhost:5555
   ```

<Message type="tip">
Once connected to the ADB daemon, you can use common ADB commands from your
local computer. For example, you can install an APK on the remote machine with
the following command:

```bash
adb -s localhost:5555 install path/to/app.apk
```
