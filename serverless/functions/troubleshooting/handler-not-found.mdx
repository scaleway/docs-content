## Problem

My serverless Function is unable to find the handler during its execution, and displays an error message similar to the following:

```
Function Handler does not exist, check that you provided the right HANDLER parameter â€¦
```

Or

```
Provided Handler does not exist, or does not export methods properly
```

## Cause

The systems cannot find the function that should handle the request. It may be related to an error in your code before your `handle` function.

## Possible solutions

- Make sure to provide the right handler path.

- If you have used a zip file, make sure the dependencies are present in your [zip package](/serverless/functions/how-to/package-function-dependencies-in-zip/).

- If you have used the Serverless framework, ensure the `.serverless` directory created with `serverless package` contains your zip file.

- Make sure that the dependencies folders (`node_modules` or `package` in Python) are in package/include.

- Serverless Functions rely on Alpine Linux. Therefore, some C-based libraries (`pandas`, `tensorflow`, `numpy`) will not work. Refer to the official documentation to safely add these libraries to your package.
