Scaleway is deprecating support for certain Instance types that have reached their End of Life (EOL).
This guide outlines the recommended steps to migrate your Kubernetes Kapsule cluster node pools from deprecated Instance types to currently supported ones.

<Requirements />

* A Scaleway account logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
* [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing actions in the intended Organization
* [Created](/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster) a Kubernetes Kapsule or Kosmos cluster


## Identifying deprecated Instance pools

1. Log in to the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com).
2. Navigate to **Kubernetes** under the **Containers** section in the side menu of the console.
3. From the drop-down menu, select the geographical region you want to manage.
4. Select the cluster containing the node pools using deprecated Instances.
5. In the **Pools** tab, check the **Instance type** column for any pools using deprecated or soon-to-be-removed types.


## Creating replacement pools with supported Instance types

1. For each pool containing end of life Instances:
   - Click **+ Create pool** (or **Add pool**).
   - Choose a supported Instance type from the **Node Type** dropdown menu.
   - Configure the pool settings (e.g., Availability Zone, size, autoscaling, autoheal) to mirror the existing pool configuration as closely as possible.
   - Click **Create** (or **Add pool**) to initiate the new pool.

2. Monitor the status of the new nodes until they reach **Ready** state:
   - In the **Pools** tab of the console.
   - Alternatively, use `kubectl` with the command:
     ```bash
     kubectl get nodes
     ```

  Schedule this migration during a maintenance window or low-traffic period to minimize service disruption.
</Message>


## Migrating workloads to the new pool

1. [**Cordon**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_cordon/) the deprecated nodes to prevent them from receiving new Pods:
   ```bash
   kubectl cordon <deprecated-node-name>
   ```

2. **Drain** the deprecated nodes to reschedule workloads onto the new nodes:

   ```bash
   kubectl drain <deprecated-node-name> --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data
   ```

   <Message type="note">
     The flags `--ignore-daemonsets` and `--delete-emptydir-data` may be necessary depending on your environment. Refer to the official [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#drain) for detailed information on these options.
   </Message>

These commands ensure that your workloads are running on the new nodes before proceeding to delete the old pool.


## Removing deprecated Instance pools

After verifying that workloads have been rescheduled, continue by deleting the old pool(s).

1. Return to your cluster’s **Pools** tab and wait a few minutes to ensure all workloads have been rescheduled onto new nodes.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the deprecated pool.
3. Select **Delete pool**.
4. Confirm the deletion.


## Verifying migration success

1. Check your nodes:

   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

   <Message type="note">
     Only nodes based on supported Instance types should now be listed.
   </Message>

2. Test your applications to confirm they are functioning correctly on the new nodes.
