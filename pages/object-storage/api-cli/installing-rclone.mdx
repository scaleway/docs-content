[Rclone](https://rclone.org) is a command-line tool that can be used to manage your cloud storage. It communicates with any Amazon S3-compatible cloud storage provider as well as other storage platforms.

Follow the instructions given in the [official Rclone documentation here](https://rclone.org/install/) to install Rclone.

For example, on Linux:

- Connect to your server as `root` via [SSH](/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).

- Then, download and install Rclone with the following sequence of commands:
  ```
  wget https://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-current-linux-amd64.zip
  apt install zip
  unzip rclone-current-linux-amd64.zip
  cd rclone*linux-amd64/
  mv rclone /usr/bin/
  ```

- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization


## Configuring Rclone

1. Run the following command to begin the Rclone configuration:
    ```
    rclone config
    ```

    If you do not have any existing remotes, the following output displays:
    ```
    2021/01/18 16:03:28 NOTICE: Config file "/root/.config/rclone/rclone.conf" not found - using defaults
    No remotes found - make a new one
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    ```

    If you have previously configured Rclone you may see a slightly different output. However, that does not affect the following steps.
2. Type `n` to make a new remote. You are then prompted to type a name - here we type `remote-sw-paris`:
    ```
    n/s/q> n
    name> remote-sw-paris
    ```

    The following output displays:

    ```
    Type of storage to configure.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").

    ```
    Option acl.
    Canned ACL used when creating buckets and storing or copying objects.
    This ACL is used for creating objects and if bucket_acl isn't set, for creating buckets too.
    For more info visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl
    Note that this ACL is applied when server-side copying objects as S3
    doesn't copy the ACL from the source but rather writes a fresh one.
    If the acl is an empty string then no X-Amz-Acl: header is added and
    the default (private) will be used.
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value.
    Press Enter to leave empty.
      / Owner gets FULL_CONTROL.
    1 | No one else has access rights (default).
      \ (private)

    2 | The AllUsers group gets READ access.
      \ (public-read)
      / Owner gets FULL_CONTROL.
    3 | The AllUsers group gets READ and WRITE access.
      | Granting this on a bucket is generally not recommended.

      \ (authenticated-read)
      / Object owner gets FULL_CONTROL.
    5 | Bucket owner gets READ access.
      | If you specify this canned ACL when creating a bucket, Amazon S3 ignores it.
      \ (bucket-owner-read)
      / Both the object owner and the bucket owner get FULL_CONTROL over the object.
    6 | If you specify this canned ACL when creating a bucket, Amazon S3 ignores it.
      \ (bucket-owner-full-control)

    <Message type="note">
      If you want to be able to transfer data to or from a bucket in a different region to the one you just set up, repeat steps 1-14 again to set up a new remote in the required region. Simply enter the required region at steps 7 and 8. Similarly, you may wish to set up a new remote for a different Object Storage provider.
