Serverless SQL Databases are automatically backed up every day at the same time. Backups are stored for 7 days. They are useful when you need to restore a specific state of your Serverless SQL Database. You can restore a database to a previous state, create a new database from a specific backup, or export a backup in `.pg_dump` format.

<Message type="important">
  The restore duration depends on the size of your database. Restore operations are considered as regular database activity, and are therefore billed the same way. Refer to our [dedicated FAQ](/faq/serverless-sql-databases/) for more information.
