## Audit Trail

Audit Trail is a tool that holds a record of events and changes performed within a Scaleway Organization. Audit Trail allows you to keep track of all actions, whether successful, attempted, or failed, performed on your Scaleway resources.

With Audit Trail you can view actions taken by any [principal](/iam/concepts/#principal) in any Project and on any of your Scaleway resources. You can also see the API methods used, the outcome of the action performed (status), and the IP address from which a principal performed an action.

Audit Trail allows you to view the metadata of the API method used, allowing you to investigate incidents and troubleshoot issues.

## Event

An event is a record of any activity related to your Scaleway resources, encompassing actions by users, applications, or Scaleway.

## Export

Audit Trail exports allow you to upload your [event](#event) logs from the past 90 days to any [Object Storage](/object-storage/) bucket.

This feature leverages Object Storage benefits which include:

- Fine-grained access management with [bucket policies](/object-storage/api-cli/bucket-policy/)
- Versioning of events for traceability and recovery
- Lifecycle rules to automate data archiving or deletion
- Flexible backup options through integration with third-party tools
- Object lock to protect data from accidental deletion

Once configured, your export runs automatically. Every day, the previous day’s Audit Trail events are exported to your chosen bucket. This provides a secure, durable, and centralized location for long-term retention, analysis, and compliance.

  <Message type="note">
    At this stage, an export includes all Audit Trail events by default, allowing only one active export configuration per region. Future updates will let you select specific events for export.

## Prefix

A prefix is a string of characters at the beginning of the [object key name](/object-storage/concepts/#object). They are often used to organize your data similarly to directories.

In the context of Scaleway Object Storage, prefixes are used to display folders in the Scaleway console for practical reasons. The `/` character in a prefix is used as a delimiter to allow you to organize your objects hierarchically.

Your Audit Trail export's event logs are stored in your Object Storage according to the following structure: `prefix/YYYY/MM/DD/logs_xxxxxxxxx.json`.

Below is an example of what your export might look like:

- `audit-trail-export/2025/09/15/logs_xxxxxxxxx.json`
- `audit-trail-export/2025/10/20/logs_xxxxxxxxx.json`
- `audit-trail-export/2025/11/11/logs_xxxxxxxxx.json`

## Project

In the context of Audit Trail, a Project refers to the place where the Scaleway resources being monitored are located. They can be located in different Scaleway Projects, of different Scaleway Organizations.

## Method

A method in the context of Audit Trail is the API call sent to the Audit Trail API whenever a principal takes an action (whether successful, attempted, or failed) on any Scaleway resource.

## Region

A region is the geographical area in which your resources are located (Paris, Amsterdam, Warsaw).

Audit Trail allows you to select and filter your resources by region and Scaleway Project. This allows you to better sort through your resources.

## Status

A status is the API response returned whenever an action was taken on a resource by a principal. There are two statuses:

- `Successful`: the API request was executed.

- `Forbidden`: permission to access the API was denied.
