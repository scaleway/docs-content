## Deploying Pydio with Object Storage

This page shows you how to spawn a Pydio application with Object Storage.

Pydio is an open source software solution for file sharing and synchronization. With intuitive user interfaces (web/mobile/desktop).

The Pydio application will store files in our Object Storage to you have an highly available and unlimited storage.

## Deploying Pydio

1. Before starting, click the "Create a Server" button in the control panel.
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-nc-new-server.png" alt="" />

2. You will land on the server-creation page where you can choose the **Pydio** image in the **InstantApps** tab for your Cloud Instance:
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-nc-instantapps.png" alt="" />

  Choose the server type and click the **Create a Server** button. This action starts your server with Etherpad pre-installed.

## Installing and Configuring Pydio

When your server is running, you can see the server's IP address in the server list on the control panel. Connect to the server via SSH and prepare the installation of Pydio:

1. Configure the repository of Pydio and update the arp cache:
  ```code
  apt-get install apt-transport-https
  echo "deb https://download.pydio.com/pub/linux/debian/ bionic main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pydio.list
  wget -qO - https://download.pydio.com/pub/linux/debian/key/pubkey | apt-key add -
  apt-get update
  ```

2. Install Pydio and its requirements:
  ```code
  apt-get install pydio
  apt-get install pydio-all
  apt-get install php-xml php-dom mariadb-server
  ```

3. Initialize the [MariaDB](/tutorials/mariadb-ubuntu-bionic/) database server:
  ```code
  mysql_secure_installation
  ```

4. Create the database and user account for Pydio:
  ```code
  mysql -u root -p
  CREATE DATABASE pydio;
  CREATE USER "pydio" IDENTIFIED BY "secret_password";
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON pydio.* TO "pydio";
  ```

5. Quit the MariaDB client by typying `\q`.

6. Open the file `/usr/share/pydio/plugins/access.s3/manifest.xml` and add a `nl-ams` Region to it:
  ```code
  [...]
  <server_settings>
    [...]
    <param name="REGION" group="CONF_MESSAGE[Location]" type="select" choices="nl-ams|Scaleway AMS, [...] label="CONF_MESSAGE[Region]" description="CONF_MESSAGE[S3 storage region]" mandatory="false"/>
    [...]
  ```

## Configuring the admin access

1. Open your web browser and type `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP/pydio` to start the configuration of Pydio.

2. Configure the admin user:
<Lightbox src="scaleway-pydio-setup-01.png" alt="" />

## Configuring the database

Pydio stores its configuration in a MySQL database. Enter the credentials of the database that you have created before.
<Lightbox src="scaleway-pydio-setup-02.png" alt="" />

## Configuring global options

The application let you customize some global parameters, like the language that is used by default:
<Lightbox src="scaleway-pydio-setup-03.png" alt="" />

Click the button to complete the installation.

## Login and start using Pydio

Pydio is now installed and ready to use. Enter the username and password you set during the configuration and login

<Lightbox src="scaleway-pydio-setup-04.png" alt="" />

## Configuring Pydio with Object Storage

1. Click the **Storage** button in the Scaleway control panel.

2. Click **Create a Bucket** to create a bucket for Pydio to store files inside.

3. Name your bucket and validate your bucket creation (a bucket name must contain only alphanumeric and lowercase characters)

4. Generate an [API key](/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key/) to have the required `access_key` and `secret_key`.

5. In Pydio, click the three dots, to display the menu, then click **Settings**.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-pydio-setup-menu.png" alt="" />

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-pydio-settings.png" alt="" />

6. Move the curser to the left edge of the page, to display the menu and click **Workspaces** followed by **+ Workspace**.

7. Click **Workspace based by... Driver**, select \*\* **S3 Amazon Web Service** as driver and fill-in with your the details of your API key.

    - KEY: your `access key`
    - SECRET KEY: your `secret_key`
    - REGION: `Scaleway AMS`
    - BUCKET: The name of the bucket you created

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-pydio-setup-05.png" alt="" />

8. Scroll down to the **Custom Storage** section and fill in the information about the storage endpoint:

  - STORAGE URL: `https://s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud`

  <Message type="important">

  Edit the **Storage URL** parameter to the region of your bucket. It can either be:
    * `s3.fr-par.scw.cloud` (Paris, France)
    * `s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud` (Amsterdam, The Netherlands)
    * `s3.pl-waw.scw.cloud` (Warsaw, Poland)

  </Message>

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-pydio-setup-06.png" alt="" />

9. Submit, once all your inputs are complete

You now have a new workspace using Object Storage that allows you to have an highly available and unlimited storage.
