## External Secrets - Overview

[External Secrets](https://external-secrets.io/) is a Kubernetes operator that allows you to manage the lifecycle of your secrets from external providers.

In this tutorial you will learn how to deploy External Secrets and its services on [Kubernetes Kapsule](/containers/kubernetes/concepts/#kubernetes-kapsule/), the managed Kubernetes service from Scaleway.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner/) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission/) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- [Created a Kapsule cluster](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/)
- Configured [kubectl](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/connect-cluster-kubectl/)
- Installed `helm`, the Kubernetes [package manager](https://helm.sh/), on your local machine (version 3.2 or latest)

## Preparing the Kubernetes Kapsule cluster

1. Make sure you are connected to your cluster and that `kubectl` and `helm` are installed on your local machine.
2. Add the External Secrets helm repository and update it using the following commands:
    ```
    helm repo add external-secrets https://charts.external-secrets.io
    helm repo update
    ```

## Deploying External Secrets

To automatically install and manage the CRDs as part of your helm release, you must add the `--set installCRDs=true` flag to your helm installation command.
Uncomment the relevant line in the next steps to enable this.
```
helm upgrade --install external-secrets  external-secrets/external-secrets \
    -n external-secrets \
    --create-namespace \
    # --set installCRDs=true
```

## Create a secret containing your Scaleway API key information

Make sure you replace `ACCESSKEY` and `SECRETKEY` with your own values.

```
echo -n 'ACCESSKEY' > ./access-key
echo -n 'SECRETKEY' > ./secret-access-key
kubectl create secret generic scwsm-secret --from-file=./access-key --from-file=./secret-access-key
```
## Create your first SecretStore

Secret Manager is a regionalized product so you will need to specify the [region](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#region/) to create your secret in.

```
---
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: SecretStore
metadata:
  name: secret-store
  namespace: default
spec:
  provider:
    scaleway:
      region: <REGION>
      projectId: <SCALEWAY_PROJECT_ID>
      accessKey:
        secretRef:
          name: scwsm-secret
          key: access-key
      secretKey:
        secretRef:
          name: scwsm-secret
          key: secret-access-key
```

## Create your first External Secret

```
---
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
    name: secret
    namespace: default
spec:
    refreshInterval: 20s
    secretStoreRef:
        kind: SecretStore
        name: secret-store
    target:
        name: kubernetes-secret-to-be-created
        creationPolicy: Owner
    data:
      - secretKey: password  # key in the kubernetes secret
        remoteRef:
          key: id:<SECRET_ID in the secret store>
          version: latest_enabled
```

A secret with the name `kubernetes-secret-to-be-created` should appear in your namespace. It contains the secret pulled from Secret Manager:

```
kubectl get secret kubernetes-secret-to-be-created
NAME                              TYPE     DATA   AGE
kubernetes-secret-to-be-created   Opaque   1      9m14s
```

## Uninstalling

Make sure you have deleted all external-secret resources you might have created beforehand. You can check for any existing resources with the following command:

```
kubectl get SecretStores,ClusterSecretStores,ExternalSecrets,ClusterExternalSecret,PushSecret --all-namespaces
```

Once all these resources have been deleted you are ready to uninstall external-secrets.

## Uninstalling with helm

Uninstall the helm release using the following command.

```
helm delete external-secrets --namespace external-secrets
```
