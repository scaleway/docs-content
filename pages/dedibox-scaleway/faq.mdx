## Overview

### What is account unification?
Account unification is a process that combines the sign-up, login, and settings of both Scaleway and Dedibox accounts into one, making it easier for you to access and manage the respective consoles.

### Why are you unifying Dedibox and Scaleway accounts?
The goal of the unification is to streamline account management for both accounts, offering you a more centralized and simplified experience, as well as access to more security feature options.

From now on, when creating a [Scaleway](https://account.scaleway.com/login?service=elements) account, you will have access to [Dedibox](https://account.scaleway.com/login?service=dedibox) and vice versa. This means you have fewer credentials to manage and remember, and a more familiar environment to use.

### What exactly will change for me with unification?
The account unification will change the following aspects:
- **Sign up**: Instead of having to create one Dedibox and one Scaleway account individually, you will now have a single creation process, in which both accounts are created automatically.
- **Log in**: You will now be able to access both the Dedibox and Scaleway consoles via [account.scaleway.com](https://account.scaleway.com). Once you enter your email address and authenticate, you will choose the console you want to access. It will be possible to switch between the consoles at any time.
- **Account settings**: All your Dedibox and Scaleway accounts and Organization settings will be managed within the same space, offering a centralized and more cohesive experience.

All other functionalities, such as billing, support, and the actual management of your services, will remain individual to each console, for now.

### How do I know if I am affected by this change?
Users whose accounts will be unified will receive an email with detailed instructions about the upcoming change.

### How will I know when the unification is completed?
You will receive email notifications to keep you informed about the unification process and any important updates.

### Can I opt out of the unification?
For the process to be effective and ensure a smooth and seamless experience for all users, it is necessary to unify all accounts. We will be available at every step of the process to guide you through this change and help you familiarize yourself with the new experience.

## Access and security

### I have previously linked my Dedibox account to Scaleway. Will I still be able to use both consoles?
Yes. Users who linked their Dedibox and Scaleway accounts **before 28 October 2025** will still be able to use and manage their Dedibox services on both the [Dedibox](https://console.online.net/en/account/home) and [Scaleway](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) consoles.

### How do I log in to the Dedibox console?
You can access your Dedibox account via [account.scaleway.com](https://account.scaleway.com/login?service=dedibox). After entering your email address and authenticating, you will be prompted to select the console you wish to visit.

If you have [linked](/dedibox-scaleway/faq/#what-was-the-account-linking-process-and-its-purpose) your Dedibox and Scaleway accounts **before 28 October 2025**, you can also log in via [console.online.net](https://console.online.net).

### Can I still use SMS MFA on my Dedibox account?
No. Multifactor Authentication (MFA) via SMS is now deprecated.
You must select an alternative method to secure your account. [Learn about our available MFA method options](/account/how-to/use-2fa/).

### Can I use SSO on my account?
Yes. You can [set up SSO](/account/how-to/use-2fa/) in your account if your email provider is Google or Microsoft. Alternatively, you can use GitHub if you use the same email address for both accounts. Once configured, you can Once configured, you can [authenticate using SSO](/account/how-to/log-in-to-the-console/?tab=log-in-with-sso-0).

### Will my password or credentials change?
In most cases, your password and any configured one-time password (TOTP) authentication methods will remain available after the account unification, except for [SMS MFA](/dedibox-scaleway/faq/#can-i-still-use-sms-mfa-on-my-dedibox-account), which will then be deprecated.

Refer to the table below to know if any password or MFA changes will apply to your situation:

| SITUATION                                                                         | PASSWORD                                      | MULTIFACTOR AUTHENTICATION (MFA)                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **I have linked my Dedibox account to Scaleway**  | Remains unchanged                       | Remains unchanged |
| **I have not linked my Dedibox account to Scaleway** | Remains unchanged                    | Remains unchanged |
| **I may or may not have linked my Dedibox account to Scaleway, but used SMS as an MFA method** | Remains unchanged | SMS authentication is no longer supported; therefore, MFA has been disabled. You must choose and set up a new method. |
| **I own multiple Dedibox accounts using the same email address** | The password has been erased. You must [access your account using an email authentication code](/account/how-to/log-in-to-the-console/?tab=authentication-code-0) and register a new password. | Any existing MFA has been erased. You must [access your account using an email authentication code](/account/how-to/log-in-to-the-console/?tab=authentication-code-0) and set up a new MFA method. |

### Will I lose any data or configuration after the unification?
No, you will not lose any data or configuration. Your Dedibox servers and their settings will remain unchanged.
If you notice any abnormality, notify the [Dedibox support team](https://console.online.net/en/support/ticket/create).

### Will my Dedibox servers be affected by the unification?
No, your Dedibox servers will not be impacted by the account unification and will remain operational. You will still be able to manage them through the [Dedibox](https://console.online.net/en/account/home) console.

### What happens if I already have MFA enabled on my Scaleway account?
If you log in to Dedibox using an email associated with a Scaleway account that has MFA (via TOTP or passkey), the security settings of the latter will take precedence.
This means you will need to complete the MFA steps from your Scaleway account, using your authenticator app or passkey, when logging in to Dedibox.

This measure ensures a consistent and secure authentication experience across Scaleway services, and you do not need to reconfigure anything, as the system will handle this automatically.

### Can I still use my multifactor authentication (MFA) app?
Yes. If you were using a TOTP-based multifactor authentication app (such as Google Authenticator, Authy, or Microsoft Authenticator) with Dedibox, your MFA settings and credentials will be automatically migrated to Scaleway after the unification.

## Pricing and billing

### Will the account unification affect my billing?
Account unification is free and does not impact your billing. Your Dedibox services and their associated billing will remain unchanged.

The unification is primarily for account management and access convenience, allowing you to manage all your resources from a single Scaleway account.

## Specifications

### Do I have to manage my Dedibox resources on the Scaleway console from now on?
If you have linked your Dedibox account to Scaleway **before 28 October 2025**, you will still have access to your resources in both the [Dedibox](https://console.online.net/en/account/home) and [Scaleway](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) consoles, as before.

If you did not link accounts before that date, your Dedibox resources will be available only in the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net/en/account/home).

### What do I need to do to prepare for the unification?
No action is required from you, as the account unification will be done automatically. We only ask that you **ensure your personal and corporate information is correct and up-to-date**.
After the unification is complete, you will receive emails to inform you about the next steps.

## Usage and management

### Can I edit my account information after the unification?
Yes. Once the account unification is completed, you will be able to manage and update your [Organization](/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#organization) information from the **Settings** space on [account.scaleway.com](http://account.scaleway.com) at any time.

### How do I grant someone access to my account?
You can use the [outsourcing feature](/dedibox-account/how-to/outsource-dedibox/) in the Dedibox console to grant a user access to specific and selected resources.

To give access to the entire account, [create a Member](/iam/how-to/manage-members/) in your Organization instead.

## Dedibox and Scaleway account linking (deprecated)

<Message type="important">
  **Dedibox and Scaleway linking was deprecated on October 28, 2025**.
  Users who have linked their accounts before this date can still access and manage them from both the Dedibox and Scaleway consoles.
  The account linking documentation only regards users who have completed this process.
</Message>

### What was the account linking process and its purpose?
The linking process was an initiative to allow **Dedibox** (Online.net) users to link their accounts to the **Scaleway** console. Once completed, it granted access to the Scaleway console, from where users could manage their Dedibox servers and associated services, whilst retaining access to the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net).

Users who have completed the linking process **before October 28, 2025** can still access and manage their accounts from both the Dedibox and Scaleway consoles.

### What is the difference between account linking and unification?
- **Account linking**: was a process available until **October 28, 2025**, where users who owned a Dedibox account were offered the possibility to link their accounts to the Scaleway console. This allowed them to try the Scaleway console and benefit from a more modern environment, while retaining access to the console they were familiar with.

- **Dedibox and Scaleway account unification**: is the first part of an ongoing project to unify the experience, access, management, and usage of both consoles, offering a seamless, safer, and optimized experience.

Both initiatives aim to provide users with the best possible experience, with the latter being a permanent change that will take place in stages.

### Will the current Dedibox API system continue to work?
Yes, the API system is not impacted by account linking.

## Billing and payment information

### I have linked my Dedibox and Scaleway accounts. Will there be any changes to my billing after the unification?
You will continue to receive separate invoices for each type of product, one for Scaleway Dedibox and one for Scaleway Cloud products. However, all invoices will be paid using the same payment method.

Therefore, once you complete the linking process, verify whether the default payment method defined in the Scaleway console is the one you want to use to pay all your future invoices (Scaleway and Dedibox).

### Where can I find my Dedibox invoices, following the linking of my accounts?
You will be able to find all your invoices in the Billing section of the Scaleway console (old Dedibox invoices as well as all new invoices).

### Following the linking of my accounts, will I find my Dedibox payment methods in the Scaleway console?
All your active Dedibox payment methods will be migrated to the new console during the linking process, so that you will be able to manage them from the Scaleway console instead of the Dedibox console. You must choose a unique default payment method for your Scaleway services, which will be used to pay all your invoices (Scaleway Cloud and Scaleway Dedibox).

The definition of your default payment method follows these rules:
  * If you have SEPA as your preferred payment method in either your Dedibox or Scaleway Cloud account, this SEPA then becomes the default payment method for both your Scaleway Cloud and Scaleway Dedibox invoices.
  * If you do not have SEPA as your preferred payment method in either account, the preferred payment method of credit card remains the same for both Scaleway Cloud and Scaleway Dedibox invoices.
  * If you use different credit cards for Dedibox and Scaleway Cloud, the card registered with Scaleway Cloud becomes the default payment method for both Scaleway Cloud and Scaleway Dedibox invoices.

<Message type="tip">
  Once account linking has been completed, you can modify your payment method in the [billing section](https://console.scaleway.com/billing/payment) of the Scaleway console. All existing default payment methods will be transferred to your linked account.
</Message>

### What information is synchronized between the two consoles?
We will synchronize your personal information (first name, last name, email address, phone number) and billing information (address, company name - if any, VAT number - if any, billing contact) between Scaleway and Dedibox. Once linked, you will be able to edit this information from the Scaleway console only.

<Message type="important">
  Once you have linked your account, you can edit your payment information from the Scaleway console only. You will not be able to edit the payment information from the Dedibox console anymore.
</Message>
