This guide shows how to perform an operation using either the CLI or REST API.

<Requirements />
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- Created an [API key](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) and that the API key has sufficient [IAM permissions](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/) to perform the actions described on this page
- Your [Organization ID](https://console.scaleway.com/organization/settings)
- [Installed `curl`](https://curl.se/download.html)
- Installed and initialized the [Scaleway CLI](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/scaleway-cli/quickstart/)

## Performing the action using the REST API

1. Edit the **POST** request payload you will use to perform the action. Replace the parameters in the following example:

    ```json
    '{
        "name": "my-resource-name",
        "organization_id": "b12d5c3g-c612-5674-c1e9-92627f36c5b9",
        "description": "Description of the resource",
        "region": "fr-par"
    }'
    ```

    | **Parameter** | **Description** |
    | --- | --- |
    | `name` | Name for the resource you want to create. |
    | `organization_id` | ID of the Organization in which to create the resource. Must be in UUID format. |
    | `description` | Optional description for the resource. |
    | `region` | Region where the resource will be created. Supported values: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw`. |

2. Run the following command to create the resource. Make sure you include the payload you edited in the previous step.

    ```
    curl -X POST \

      -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      "https://api.scaleway.com/service/v1/regions/fr-par/resource" \
      -d '{
          "name": "my-resource-name",
          "organization_id": "b12d5c3g-c612-5674-c1e9-92627f36c5b9",
          "description": "Description of the resource",
          "region": "fr-par"
        }'
    ```
    You should get a response like the following:

    ```
    {
      "id": "111e89f4-a565-49ea-90da-073255490a67",
      "name": "my-resource-name",
      "organization_id": "b12d5c3g-c612-5674-c1e9-92627f36c5b9",
      "region": "fr-par",
      "status": "creating",
      "created_at": "2025-04-05T10:00:00.000000Z",
      "updated_at": "2025-04-05T10:00:00.000000Z",
      "description": "Description of the resource"
    }
    ```

## Performing the action using the CLI

1. Run the following command to create the resource.

    ```bash
    scw service:action \
      parameter1=value1 \
      parameter2=value2 \
      region=fr-par
    ```

    You should see an output like the following:

    ```text
    ID: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
    Status: active
    ```
