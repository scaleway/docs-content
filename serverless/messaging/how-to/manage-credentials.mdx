This page shows how to manage [credentials](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#credentials) for Scaleway Messaging and Queuing. Credentials for SQS or SNS can be updated to change their permissions, or revoked. NATS credentials can only be revoked, not updated. Once credentials are revoked, any user trying to use the credentials to connect to the service will be denied.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
