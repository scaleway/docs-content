<Macro id="requirements" />
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- A [Mac mini](/apple-silicon/how-to/create-mac-mini/)

## Problem
You are unable to establish a remote desktop (VNC) connection to your Scaleway Mac mini.

### Symptoms
- VNC client fails to connect to the Mac mini.
- Authentication errors occur during connection attempts.
- Connection times out or is refused.
- Mac mini appears unreachable.

### Possible causes
- The Mac mini is powered off or unresponsive.
- The VNC port assigned during system setup is incorrect.
- The SSH server is unresponsive.
- Your connection is blacklisted due to failed attempts.
- Incorrect credentials are being used.
- Remote connection client compatibility issues.

### Solution

#### Verify the server status
Run the following command in a terminal:
```sh
ping -c 5 <server_ip>
```
If `ping` fails:
- Try [rebooting the server](/apple-silicon/how-to/reboot-mac-mini/).
- If the server was forced to shut down, wait 24 hours for automatic restart.

#### Verify the VNC connection
Run the following command:
```sh
nc -zv <server_ip> <vnc_port>
```
If the connection fails:
- Verify the correct VNC port in the **Overview** section of your Scaleway console.
- [Reboot the server](/apple-silicon/how-to/reboot-mac-mini/).
- Restart screen sharing via SSH (see below).

#### Verify the SSH server response
Run the command:
```sh
nc -zv <server_ip> 22
```
If the connection fails, [reboot the server](/apple-silicon/how-to/reboot-mac-mini/).

#### Check for connection blacklisting
If VNC connection attempts fail repeatedly, your connection may be blacklisted. [Rebooting](/apple-silicon/how-to/reboot-mac-mini/) clears the `fail2ban` table.

#### Verify your connection credentials
- VNC: Ensure correct username and password.
- SSH: Ensure your SSH key was provided before installation.

#### Verify remote access client compatibility
Use a compatible VNC client. See [this guide](/apple-silicon/how-to/access-remote-desktop-mac-mini/#comparison-matrix-of-remote-desktop-clients) for recommendations.

#### Reinstall the Mac mini
If all else fails, [reinstall macOS](/apple-silicon/how-to/reinstall-mac-mini/) via the Scaleway console. 
<Message type="important">
  Reinstalling your Mac mini will delete all data on its disk. Ensure you have a backup of your data before launching any reinstallation.

## Advanced configuration and security

### Enabling and configuring Packet Filter (pf)
1. Open the pf configuration file in a text editor to restrict access to screen sharing:
    ```sh
    sudo nano /etc/pf.conf
    ```
2. Add the following lines to the file and save it:
    ```sh
    block in on en0 proto tcp from any to any port 5900
    pass in on en0 proto tcp from <static IP> to any port 5900
    ```
3. Apply the configuration:
    ```sh
    sudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf
    ```

### Restarting screen sharing via SSH
1. Connect via SSH:
    ```sh
    ssh your_mac_mini_username@<your_mac_mini_ip>
    ```
2. Restart screen sharing:
    ```sh
    sudo killall screensharingd
    ```
