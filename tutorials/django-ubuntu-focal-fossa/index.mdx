## Django Overview

Django is a web development framework which allows you to develop dynamic websites and applications. Django allows the use of less code and eases the creation of complex websites. It provides a very good structure and easy methods that help do the heavy lifting when writing web applications.

There are many different ways to install Django on Ubuntu:

- Django installation with pip in a virtual environment: By installing pip, any user on the system can install and use Django. The pip should always contain the latest stable Django. By using this method, you can install Django without affecting the entire system. This is typically the most practical and recommended approach to working with Django.

- Django installation from packages: Ubuntu repositories contain Django packages (using the `apt` package manager). The main disadvantage is the version contained in the repositories may lag behind the official versions available from the project.

- Django installation from its github repository: if you wish to install the latest development version instead of the stable release.

In this tutorial, we will install Django with pip in a virtual environment, as it is the most practical and most flexible way to install without affecting the larger system, along with other per-project customizations and packages.

## Installing Django on Ubuntu with pip in a Virtual Environment

1. Update your local package index with `apt`
    ```
    apt update
    ```
2. Check which version of Python you have installed. The version currently shipped with Ubuntu 20.04 is Python 3.8.2:
    ```
    root@Django:~# python3 -V
    Python 3.8.10
    ```
3. Install pip from the Ubuntu repositories
    ```
    apt install python3-pip python3-django
    ```
4. Install the `venv` package with `pip`
    ```
    apt install python3-venv
    ```
5. Once that is done, you can now start a new project in Django. Remember that whenever you start a new project, start by creating and moving into a new project directory.
    ```
    mkdir ~/newhostA
    cd ~/newhostA
    ```
6. Create a virtual environment within the project directory using the python command that is compatible with your version of Python. We will call our virtual environment `my_env`.
    ```
    python3.8 -m venv my_env
    ```

    This will install standalone versions of Python and pip into an isolated directory structure within your project directory. A directory will be created with the name you select, which will hold the file hierarchy where your packages will be installed.
7. To install packages into the isolated environment, you must activate it by typing:
    ```
    source my_env/bin/activate
    ```

    Your prompt should change to reflect that you are now in your virtual environment. It will look something like:

    ```
    (my_env) root@Django:~/newhostA#
    ```
8. In your environment, install Django with pip
    ```
    pip install django
    ```
9. Verify the version you have installed.
    ```
    django-admin --version
    ```

    which returns

    ```
    (my_env) root@Django:~/newhostA# django-admin --version
    4.0.1
    ```

    To leave your virtual environment, you need to issue the deactivate command from anywhere on the system:

    ```
    deactivate
    ```

    Your prompt should revert to the normal display.

    <Message type="note">
      If you need to re-activate your virtual environment, moving back into your project directory and activating:
      ```
      cd ~/newhostA
      source my_env/bin/activate
      ```
    </Message>

## Creating a Sample Project

With Django installed, we can now start to create our project and test it on your development server using a virtual environment.

1. Create a directory for your project
    ```
    mkdir ~/my-django
    cd ~/my-django
    ```
2. Create your virtual environment
    ```
    python3.8 -m venv my_env
    ```
3. Activate the environment
    ```
    source my_env/bin/activate
    ```
4. Install `django` in the environment:
    ```
    pip install django
    ```
5. To create your project, use `django-admin <command> [options]` which is Django's command-line utility for administrative tasks. In each Django project, a `manage.py` is automatically created.

    The `startproject` command enables you to create a new project. The command creates a directory within your current working directory that includes:

    * `manage.py` which you can use to administer various Django-specific tasks.
    * a directory (with the same name as the project) that includes the actual project code.
6. Create your project(`myDjangoProject`). Add a period at the end of the command to place the management script and inner directory in the current directory.
    ```
    django-admin startproject myDjangoProject .
    ```
7. Migrate the database (this example uses SQLite by default) using the `migrate` command with the `manage.py` application. Migrations apply any changes you have made to your Django models, to your database schema.
    ```
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

    which returns
    ```
    Operations to perform:
      Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions
    Running migrations:
      Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
      Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
      Applying admin.0001_initial... OK
      Applying admin.0002_logentry_remove_auto_add... OK
      Applying admin.0003_logentry_add_action_flag_choices... OK
      Applying contenttypes.0002_remove_content_type_name... OK
      Applying auth.0002_alter_permission_name_max_length... OK
      Applying auth.0003_alter_user_email_max_length... OK
      Applying auth.0004_alter_user_username_opts... OK
      Applying auth.0005_alter_user_last_login_null... OK
      Applying auth.0006_require_contenttypes_0002... OK
      Applying auth.0007_alter_validators_add_error_messages... OK
      Applying auth.0008_alter_user_username_max_length... OK
      Applying auth.0009_alter_user_last_name_max_length... OK
      Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK
    ```
8. Create an administrative user so that you can use the Django admin interface using the `createsuperuser` command.
    ```
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
9. Answer the prompts which will ask for:
    * A username
    * An email address
    * A password (containing at least 8 characters)

    ```
    (my_env) root@Django:~/my-django# python manage.py createsuperuser
    Username (leave blank to use 'root'): scaleway
    Email address: usertest@example.com
    Password:
    Password (again):
    Superuser created successfully.
    ```

## Modifying Django Settings

1. Open the settings file
    ```
    nano myDjangoProject/settings.py
    ```

    To test your application, you will need to modify one of the directives in the Django settings. Locate the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` directive to define the addresses or domain names that may be used to connect to the Django Instance.
2. List the IP addresses or domain names that are associated with your Django server.
    <Message type="note">
      Each item should be listed in quotations, with separate entries separated by a comma.
      ```
      . . .
      ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your_server_ip_or_domain', 'your_second_ip_or_domain', . . .]
      ```
    </Message>
3. Save the file and exit

## Testing the Development Server

<Message type="important">
  Before you try the development server, make sure you open the appropriate port in your firewall. If you followed the initial server setup guide and are using UFW, you can open port 8000 by typing: `ufw allow 8000`
</Message>

1. Start the development server
    ```
    python manage.py runserver your_server_ip:8000
    ```
2. Visit your server's IP address followed by :8000 in your web browser `http://your_internal_server_ip:8000` which should display
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-django_installed.webp" alt="" />
3.  Add `/admin/` to the end of your URL. The login page displays.
4. Enter your username and password. The admin page displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-django_admin.webp" alt="" />
