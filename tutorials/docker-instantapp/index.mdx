## Getting Started with the Docker InstantApp

This page shows you how to use the Docker InstantApp on your cloud instance.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have [configured your SSH Key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key)

</Message>

## Creating and Starting a New Cloud Instance Using the Docker Instantapp

Before starting, click the **Create an Instance** button in the management console.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-docker_create_instance.png" alt="" />

You will land on the server-creation page where you can choose the **Docker** image in the **InstantApps** tab for your Cloud Instance:

<Lightbox src="scaleway-docker_choose_image.png" alt="" />

Choose the instance type, enter additional parameters like tags and click the **Create a new instance** button. This action starts your instance with Docker pre-installed.

## Connecting to Your Instance

Connect to your instance via SSH. To do so, you must have configured an [SSH key pair](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key) on your local computer and uloaded the public key to your management console.

On Windows, you can use [Putty](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/#how-to-connect-from-windows) to connect to your instance.

On Linux or MacOs, you can open a terminal and type the following command to connect to your instance:

```
john@localhost:~$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_private_key root@your_instance_ip
```

Once logged in, you will be greeted by the following screen showing some parameters about the instance and the Docker version already pre-installed on the instance:

## Building your First Container

Docker allows you to ship applications in containers. Containers are standardized units of software that bundle the applications code and all its dependencies into one package, so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. This is a text document that contains all the commands a user would execute on the command line to assemble an image.

Create a new Dockefile for a small Python web application with [Flask](/tutorials/flask), that will run on the instance:

1. Create a new directory to develop your environment

  ```
  mkdir my-application
  ```

2. Enter into the directory

  ```
  cd my-application
  ```

3. Create a new file, called `Dockerfile`, copy & paste the following content into it and save the file

  ```
  # Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
  FROM python:3.7-slim

  # Set the working directory to /app
  WORKDIR /app

  # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
  ADD . /app

  # Install the Flask framework
  RUN pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org Flask

  # Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
  EXPOSE 80

  # Define environment variable
  ENV NAME World

  # Run app.py when the container launches
  CMD ["python", "app.py"]
  ```

4. Now as the Dockerfile is ready, it is time to create the application. Open a text editor, copy paste the following content and save the file as `app.py`.

  ```py
  from flask import Flask
  import os
  import socket

  app = Flask(__name__)

  @app.route("/")
  def hello():

      html = "<h1>Hello {name}!</h1>" \
            "<b>Hostname:</b> {hostname}<br/>"
      return html.format(name=os.getenv("NAME", "world"), hostname=socket.gethostname(),)

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=80)
  ```

  The application will run a simple web server on port 80 and return the values of the environment variable `NAME` set in the Dockerfile, as well as the hostname of the container when it is running.

5. Build the image. The `-t` tag is used to set a friendly name for the image:

  ```
  docker build -t helloworld .
  ```

  Docker will now download the python base image and process the tasks defined in the Dockerfile:

  The image is now available in the local docker registry:

  ```
  docker image ls

  REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
  helloworld          latest              71368b10bc5c        3 minutes ago       153MB
  ```

## Running the Application

Run the application with the `-p` option to map the port 4000 of your instance to port 80 of the container:

```code
docker run -p 4000:80 helloworld
```

A message that the application called `app` is running is shown:

```
* Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
* Environment: production
  WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.
  Use a production WSGI server instead.
* Debug mode: off
* Running on http://0.0.0.0:80/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

The message displays the information, that the application is running on port `80`.

Remember, this is the internal port of the container and to reach the application type `http://your_instances_ip:4000` in the address bar of your browser:

<Lightbox src="scaleway-docker_app_running.png" alt="" />

The application displays the internal hostname of the container and retrieves the word "World" from the environment variable that was set in the Dockerfile.

### Sharing the Application

Docker allows easily to ship images to a registry to share it with others.

In this example, the public docker registry is used, but it also possible to set up a [private registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/) to distribute the image on your infrastructure.

> It is required to have a Docker account for this part of the tutorial. If you do not have one, you can create an account at [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com).

1. Login into the Docker registry:

  ```code
  docker login
  ```

  To associate a local image with a repository on a registry, you have to use the notation `username/repository:tag`.

  The tag is not mandatory, but recommended as it is the mechanism that registries use to give Docker images a version.

  To push your image you have to run `docker tag` with your username, repository, and tag, so your image uploads to the desired destination.

2. Tag the image:

  ```code
  docker tag imagename username/repository:tag
  ```

3. Publish your image:

  ```code
  docker push username/repository:tag
  ```

  Once the image has been pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) it will be publicly available and you can see the image with its pull command in your account.

### Pulling and Running an Image from a Remote Repository

As your image is available on the Docker Hub now, you can run it from everywhere

```code
docker run -p 4000:80 username/repository:tag
```

If the image is not available yet on the local machine, Docker will download it from the registry.

No matter on which machine you run it, it will always run in the same environment that you have configured when you have built the image.
