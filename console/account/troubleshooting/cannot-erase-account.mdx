## My request to erase my account and personal data has failed

### Problem
When you click the **Send request** button, an error message appears. This message says that you still have active resources.

### Cause
You have active resources, preventing us from proceeding with your request. 

### Solution 
You can check all your active resources from your [Organization dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/organization/). If one or more resources are listed, they are active. You need to delete all of them manually. In this situation, you must wait for the current month's invoice to be paid before sending another request to erase your account. 


### Problem
I received an email explaining that my request to erase my account and personal data had failed. 

### Cause
You may have unpaid consumption, preventing us from proceeding with your request. 

### Solution 
You can check your consumption from your [Billing space](https://console.scaleway.com/billing/). All invoices must be marked as paid, and your current consumption must be zero. Once these criteria are met, you can send another request to delete your account and personal data.
