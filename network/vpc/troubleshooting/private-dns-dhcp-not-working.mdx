There are some cases when a Private Network's private DNS or DHCP may not work 'out of the box' for attached resources. Read on to find out how to fix these problems.

<Message type="tip">
Make sure that [DHCP is activated](/network/vpc/how-to/activate-dhcp/) on your Private Network, and that you have tried [detaching/reattaching any "old" resources](/network/vpc/troubleshooting/resource-attached-no-ip/#no-ip-address-is-displayed-but-i-have-activated-dhcp)

## Private DNS is not working

Private DNS should work out of the box for attached resources with Debian-based distributions, and for distributions using `systemd-resolved`, such as Ubuntu.

It does **not** work out of the box for Linux distributions using Network Manager, such as **RockyLinux**. If your resource is running RockyLinux, or another distribution using Network Manager, you should manually configure the system to use the nameserver `169.254.169.254`. You will then be able to resolve the name of your resources, as well as public domain names.

## DHCP is not working

DHCP should work out of the box for attached resources running any and all Linux distributions. However, when it comes to **ArchLinux**, we are aware of a problem when it comes to setting a Classless Static Route to our service IP address `169.254.169.254`.

In this case, if you are using `systemd-networkd` and do not have a route to our service IP address `169.254.169.254`, you should try updating and upgrading the packages on your system.
