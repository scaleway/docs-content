[Load Balancers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/load-balancer/) are highly available and fully-managed Instances which allow you to distribute your workload across your various servers. They ensure the scaling of all your applications while securing their continuous availability, even in the event of heavy traffic. Load Balancers are commonly used to improve the performance and reliability of websites, applications, databases, and other services.

2. Click **Create Load Balancer** or the <Icon name="plus" /> button. The creation wizard displays.

4. Choose the **Availability Zone** in which your Load Balancer will be deployed geographically. Currently we provide the following Availability Zones:
      - `PAR1`: Paris 1, France.
      - `PAR2`: Paris 2, France (innovative and sustainable availability zone).
      - `AMS1`: Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
      - `AMS2`: Amsterdam 2, The Netherlands.
      - `WAW1`: Warsaw, Poland.
      - `WAW2`: Warsaw, Poland.

5. Select a Load Balancer **type**, according to your needs in terms of **bandwidth** and whether you want to be able to attach backend servers from other cloud providers than Scaleway (**Multi-cloud provider**).

6. Select an **IP address** for your Load Balancer. You can either allocate a new IP, or select one of your existing IPs.

7. Choose one of the following options:
  - Click **Create Load Balancer** to finish now and create your Load Balancer without any frontends or backends. You can configure and add frontends and backends to your Load Balancer whenever you want after creation.
  - Click **Add frontend and backend** to configure a frontend and backend for your Load Balancer immediately, before finishing creation of the Load Balancer. See [how to create frontends and backends](/network/load-balancer/how-to/create-frontends-backends/) for help with this step.
