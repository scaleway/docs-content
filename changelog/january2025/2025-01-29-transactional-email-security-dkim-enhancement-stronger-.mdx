We have enhanced the security of DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) signatures by including additional headers. This improvement strengthens email authentication, reduces the risk of spoofing, and enhances deliverability across various email providers.
The following headers are now included in the DKIM signature:  
- List-ID
- List-Help
- List-Owner
- List-Post
- List-Subscribe
- List-Unsubscribe
- List-Unsubscribe-Post
- Message-ID
