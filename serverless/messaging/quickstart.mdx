Scaleway NATS, Queues, and Topics and Events are [message broker](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#messaging-and-queuing) tools that allows you to transfer messages between different microservices and platforms. This enables them to "talk" to each other effectively even if they are not otherwise compatible. These brokers enable and simplify microservices application development and allows you to build highly scalable, reliable, distributed applications.

NATS, Queues, and Topics and Events were previously grouped together as the Messaging and Queuing product, and have now become three separate products in their own right. Read on to learn how to get started with your product of choice

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## Quickstart for NATS

### How to create a NATS account

To start using a NATS message broker, you must first create a NATS account. This sets a scope for your NATS credentials, messages, queues and stream.

1. Click **NATS** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The following screen displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-activate-mandq.webp" alt="" /> TODOCHECK AND CHECK ALL STEPS

2. Select a [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) from the drop-down menu. The region designates the geographical area where the NATS account will be hosted.

3. Click **Create a NATS account**. The creation wizard displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-nats-account.webp" alt="" />

4. Complete the following steps in the wizard:

    - Check the **region**, which is the geographical location in which your NATS account will be created. If you want to use a different region to the one shown, go back to step 2 to change it.
    - Enter a **name** for your NATS account, or use the auto-generated name suggested for you.
    - Optionally, use the **Estimated cost** calculator to simulate how messages sent and stored with NATS streams will be billed. Note that simply creating a NATS account does not in itself incur any billing. For more information about NATS billing, see the [FAQ](/faq/messaging-and-queuing/).
    - Click **Create NATS account** to finish

    You are directed to the listing of your NATS accounts, where your newly-created NATS account now appears.

### How to create NATS credentials

Credentials for NATS accounts are not granular: they necessarily give full read and write access. The bearer of these credentials can publish and receive messages, as well as manage topics and streams, for this account.

1. Click **NATS** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu.

2. Use the drop-down menu to select the [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) of the NATS account for which you want to create credentials.

3. Click the NATS account you want to generate credentials for. The account's **Overview** page displays.

4. In the **Credentials** panel, click **Generate credentials**. A pop-up displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-generate-nats-creds.webp" alt="" />

5. Enter a name for these credentials, and click **Generate credentials**.

    The credentials are created and a button displays prompting you to download them in a `.creds` file.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-nats-cred-generated.webp" alt="" />

    <Message type="important">
      The generated credentials are displayed only once. Make sure to download and safely store them before closing the window.
    </Message>

6. Click **Download** and save the file, before closing the window.

    You are returned to your namespace's overview page. The name of your newly-generated credentials and their access level is displayed in the **Credentials** panel.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-nats-credentials-display.webp" alt="" />


### How to create and manage queues, messages and streams

All further actions related to publishing, processing and managing messages, subjects, queues and streams can be done via a supported CLI or SDK. See our documentation on [NATS CLI and SDKs](/serverless/messaging/reference-content/nats-overview#further-actions:-nats-cli-and-nats-sdk) for more information. You can also check out our tutorial on [creating a serverless architecture for handling large messages](/tutorials/large-messages/) with Scaleway Messaging and Queuing NATS.

### How to delete a NATS account

1. Click **NATS** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu.

2. Use the drop-down menu to select the [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) containing the NATS account you want to delete.

3. Click the NATS account you want to delete.

4. In the bottom panel, click the **Delete NATS account** button.

    A popup displays, reminding you that the action is irreversible, and any associated queued messages and credentials will be deleted.

5. Type `DELETE` and click **Delete NATS account** to confirm.


## Quickstart for Queues

### How to create credentials for Queues

Credentials for Queues are granular: you can define the level of access that they should give.

1. Click **Queues** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu.

2. Click **Generate credentials**. A pop-up displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-generate-creds-sqs.webp" alt="" /> TODO CHECK

4. Enter a name for these credentials.

5. Select the required permissions for the credentials. You must choose at least one of **Write**, **Read** and **Manage**. You are free to select any combination of these permissions.

6. Click **Generate credentials**.

    The credentials are created. The access key and secret key are displayed, and you are invited to copy them.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-sqs-sns-creds-generated.webp" alt="" />

    <Message type="important">
      This is your only chance to view and save the secret key. Make sure that you copy it and save it somewhere securely.
    </Message>

7. Copy and save the credentials, before closing the window.

    You are returned to your Messaging and Queuing SQS service's **Credentials** tab. The name of your newly-generated credentials, along with the access key and access level are displayed.

### How to create queues

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of Messaging and Queuing protocols displays.

2. Use the dropdown menu to select the [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) in which you want to create a queue.

3. Click **SQS**, then **Create queue**. The queue creation wizard displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-queue.webp" alt="" />

4. Check the [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) that your queue will be created in. If you want to change the region, go back to step 2.

5. Enter a **name** for your queue. The name must be no more than 80 characters, and consist only of alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. Alternatively, you can go with the auto-generated name suggested for you.

6. Choose your **queue type**, from one of the following:
    - **Standard**: Standard queues ensure at-least-once delivery. The exact order of messages in the queue is not preserved.
    - **FIFO**: FIFO queues (**F**irst **In** **F**irst **O**ut) preserves the exact ordering of messages.

7. Configure your queue's **parameters**. The following parameters can be defined:
    - **Visibility timeout**: The length of time (in seconds) during which, after a message is received, it is hidden and cannot be received again by the same or other consumers. This is useful as the queue itself does not automatically delete messages once they are received, and so prevents consumers from receiving the same message many times before they have finished processing it. Therefore, the value set here should be informed by the expected length of time it will take consumers to process messages. The default value is 30 seconds. The value must be between 1 second and 43 200 seconds (12 hours).
    - **Message retention period**: The length of time (in seconds) that messages are kept in the queue before being deleted. Setting a longer message retention period allows for a longer interval between a message being sent and it being received. The default value is 60 seconds. The value must be between 60 seconds and 1 290 600 seconds (14 days).
    - **Maximum message size**: The maximum size (in kilobytes) of a message that can be sent to the queue. Messages greater than the defined size will be rejected. The default value is 256 KB. The value must be between 1 KB and 256 KB.
    - **Content Based Deduplication**: This setting is only available for FIFO queues. Enable content based deduplication if the message body is guaranteed to be unique for each message. A unique hash value is generated from the body of each message, which is used as its deduplication ID. This avoids the need to set a deduplication ID when sending messages.

8. Click **Create queue** to finish.

You are returned to the **Queues** tab, where your newly-created queue now displays. You can view its URL here, for use in your API/CLI operations. Go further by clicking on the queue's name to access its **Settings** page and see additional information such as its ARN (Amazon Resource Name) and configuration parameters.

### How to send and receive messages

All further actions related to sending messages to queues can be done via a supported CLI or SDK. See our documentation on the [SQS CLI and SDKs](/serverless/messaging/reference-content/sqs-overview#further-actions) for more information. You can also check out [our tutorial](/tutorials/create-serverless-scraping/) on creating a serverless scraping architecture with Scaleway Messaging and Queuing SQS queues.

### How to deactivate SQS

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of Messaging and Queuing protocols displays.

3. Click **SQS** or **SNS** depending on which protocol you want to deactivate.

4. Click the **Settings** tab.

    <Message type="tip">
    If you do not currently have any credentials, topics or queues created for SQS, you will not be able to access the Settings tab. Temporarily create credentials or a queue, in order to access the Settings tab. Then, proceed with the steps below to deactivate the protocol.
    </Message>

5. In the bottom panel, click the **Deactivate SQS** button.

   A popup displays, reminding you that any existing SQS resources you have will be permanently deleted, and that you will not be able to create any new queues or credentials unless you reactivate the protocol.

6. Click **Deactivate SQS** to confirm.

<Message type="note">
SQS must be deactivated on a region-by-region basis. If you have activated SQS in other [regions](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region), and you also want to deactivate those, repeat the process above to deactivate the protocol in each one.
</Message>

## Quickstart for SNS

2. Use the dropdown menu to select the [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) of the topic you want to create a subscription for.

3. Click **SNS**, then navigate to the **Topics** tab and click the topic you want to create a subscription for.

4. Click **create subscription**. The subscription creation wizard displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-subscription.webp" alt="" />

5. Verify the parameters of the topic that you are creating a subscription for.

6. Choose a protocol, based on the type of endpoint or client you want to subscribe. Click the tab below for further details and full instructions on each protocol:

    <Tabs id="messaging-subscription-protocol">
        <TabsTab label="HTTP">
          <br />
          Select **HTTP** to create a subscription for a service or web server that can receive `HTTP POST` requests from SNS, via standard HTTP protocol.

          Note that for security reasons, we recommend using the HTTPS protocol, rather than HTTP.

          You are prompted to enter the URL of the HTTP endpoint to subscribe, e.g. `example.com`. Note that the scheme (`http://`) is not required.

          After your HTTP subscription is created, you must confirm it. Find out how in our [dedicated documentation](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-subscriptions/#how-to-confirm-an-http-or-https-subscription).

        </TabsTab>
        <TabsTab label="HTTPS">
          <br />
          Select **HTTPS** to create a subscription for a service or web server that can receive `HTTP POST` requests from SNS, via secure HTTP protocol.
