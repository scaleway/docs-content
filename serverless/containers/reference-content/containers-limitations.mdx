This section contains usage limits that apply when using Serverless Containers.

\* Lower limits may apply before account verification. Contact our support team if you have any questions.

\** Total container memory is the sum of the memory allocated to all your containers at their maximum Scale.

\*** Use [Serverless Jobs](/serverless/jobs/) for longer tasks.

These limits are enforced as [Organization quotas](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/additional-content/organization-quotas/#serverless-containers).

During the execution of the container, if the limits are exceeded, a restart occurs.

## Configuration Restrictions

In order to ensure the proper functioning of the product, we restrict the use of certain ports and environment variables

* Blocked ports:
  * **25**: Due to potential abuse (spam), no outbound traffic is allowed through this port, except from Scaleway Transactional Email SMTP servers.
  * **465**: Due to potential abuse (spam), no outbound traffic is allowed through this port, except from Scaleway Transactional Email SMTP servers.
* Unavailable custom ports
  Do not make your containers listen on these ports which are used by our service.
  * 8008
  * 8012
  * 8013
  * 8022
  * 9090
  * 9091
* Reserved environment variables:
  * `PORT`: Value of the port defined in the Container settings, which the container has to listen on. You can use this environment variable inside your Container for easier deployments.
  * `SCW_*`: Reserved for product configuration (for example: token validation)

## Default values for CPU and memory limits

When container CPU and/or memory are not provided by the client, these default values are automatically used:

| Resources | Default value  |
|-----------|----------------|
| CPU       | 1000 mvCPU     |
| Memory    | 2048 MB       |

## Architecture

Scaleway Containers only supports `amd64` [architecture](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images?tab=readme-ov-file#architectures-other-than-amd64) for
images.

For example, if you build an image using an ARM CPU, such as Apple Silicon M series, your image will be in the `arm64` architecture, and you will have an error message during deployment.

You must ensure that you build your image to target `amd64` architecture, to acheive this there are multiple solutions:
* You can use the following Docker command: `docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 .`, or
* You can use an Instance with `amd64` architecture to run your builds.
