import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'


<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created a [Kubernetes Kapsule cluster](/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/)

## How to access the Kubernetes dashboard

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements) side menu. The Kubernetes Kapsule overview displays.
2. From the drop-down menu, select the geographical region you want to manage.
3. Click the name of the cluster you want to access. The cluster overview page displays. This page provides several pieces of information about your cluster.
4. Click **Dashboard**. You are taken to your cluster's Kubernetes dashboard.
   Here, you can troubleshoot your containerized application, manage the cluster resources, get an overview of applications running on your cluster, and create or modify certain resources.

<Message type="note">
  The Kubernetes dashboard offers insights into your cluster's workloads, applications, and individual resource metrics. Unlike Cockpit's control plane dashboards, this dashboard focuses more on operational details within your data plane such as the nodes and workloads running in your cluster.

  For advanced observability of your Kubernetes Kapsule data plane, refer to the [How to monitor your Kubernetes Kapsule data plane with Cockpit](/kubernetes/how-to/monitor-data-plane-with-cockpit/) documentation.
