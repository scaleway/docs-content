This document sets out the writing guidelines (style guide) for Scaleway Documentation, including grammar, formatting, and standardized terminology. These guidelines should be followed by both internal and external contributors when making additions to the Scaleway Documentation site.

For details on contributing to the Scaleway documentation as a user, see our [dedicated page](/contribute/).

## Overall writing guidelines

### Language

Scaleway Documentation uses [American English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English) (US English). Where words are spelled differently in American English to, for example, British English, use the American spelling. Here are some examples:

| ✅ AMERICAN ENGLISH   | ❌ OTHER VARIATIONS   |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Center, fiber         | Centre, fibre         |
| Recognize, prioritize | Recognise, prioritise |
| Favorite, color       | Favourite, colour     |

We do not accept contributions to Scaleway Documentation in languages other than English.

### Tone

The tone of Scaleway Documentation is generally **formal**. Do not use the **passive voice**, **"please"** or **"thank you"**, **the future tense** or **contractions**.

| ✅ DO WRITE                                | ❌ DON'T WRITE                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Click **DELETE**  to delete the Instance.  | The Instance is deleted by clicking **DELETE**. |
| Tick the box to accept the conditions.     | Please tick the box to accept the conditions.   |
| Select **Metrics**. The Grafana dashboard opens. | Select **Metrics**. The Grafana dashboard will open. |
| You cannot leave the field empty.          | You can't leave the field empty.                |

### Pronouns

When addressing the user, say "you". When referring to Scaleway, say "Scaleway", "it", or "we". 

| ✅ DO WRITE                                | ❌ DON'T WRITE                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| You can delete the Instance at any time.   | The user can delete the Instance at any time.   |
| Scaleway offers numerous Instance types.   | The provider offers numerous Instance types     |

### Numbered steps

When explaining to a user what to do, use **numbered steps**.

- Each step should represent one action the user must do.
- Each step should start with an imperative verb.
- If you want to explain the effect of the action, do so in a sentence at the end of the numbered step, or on a new, non-numbered indented line.

✅ **GOOD**

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the Scaleway console. The **Instances dashboard** displays.
2. Click the Instance whose flexible IP address you want to detach. The **Overview page** for that Instance displays.
3. Click **Detach** <Icon name="unlink" /> next to the flexible IP address you want to detach.

❌ **BAD**

1. Start by clicking **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the Scaleway console.
2. You will see the **Instances dashboard**.
3. Next, you need to find the Instance whose flexible IP address you want to detach, and click on it. You'll see the **Overview page** for the Instance. To finish the process, click **Detach** <Icon name="unlink" /> next to the flexible IP address you want to detach.

## Page types, formats and structure

### Page types

All documentation pages must fall into one of the following categories:

| PAGE TYPE          | DESCRIPTION                                                                              |
| -------------------| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| How to             | Shows how to do a core action (e.g. create, configure, delete, use features) for a Scaleway product via the console, e.g. [How to create a Load Balancer](/network/load-balancer/how-to/create-load-balancer/)                                        |
| Quickstart         | Shows how to do the main series of actions necessary to start using a Scaleway product via the console, e.g. [Instances Quickstart](/compute/instances/quickstart/)                                   |
| Concepts           | Defines and briefly explains the main terminology associated with a Scaleway product, e.g. [Kubernetes Concepts](/containers/kubernetes/concepts/)                                            |
| Troubleshooting    | Gives solutions to help resolve a common issue with a Scaleway product, e.g. [VPC auto-config is not working](/network/vpc/troubleshooting/autoconfig-not-working/)                          |
| API/CLI          | Presents information and tips for creating and configuring a Scaleway product via both official and third-party APIs, CLIs, SDKs and other developer tools, e.g. Terraform, e.g. [Using Object Storage with the AWS-CLI](/storage/object/api-cli/object-storage-aws-cli/). These pages complement the [main developer reference documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/).                           |
| Additional Content | Provides detailed information on specific subjects and features associated with a Scaleway product, e.g. [Optimize your Object Storage performance](/storage/object/reference-content/optimize-object-storage-performance/)                                            |
| Tutorial           | Explains how to use a Scaleway product with a third-party tool, or how to use multiple Scaleway products together for a specific use-case, e.g. [Setting up a Proxmox cluster on Elastic Metal servers using Private Networks](/tutorials/setup-elastic-metal-proxmox-cluster-with-private-networks/)                                            |
| FAQ                | Gives answers to the most frequently asked questions about Scaleway products, e.g. [Cockpit FAQ](/faq/cockpit/)                                            |

Anyone can suggest corrections, improvements and extensions to any type of documentation page by [forking our repository and opening a PR](https://github.com/scaleway/docs-content).

When creating an entirely new documentation page from scratch, we generally expect external contributions to be for new **Tutorials**, **Additional Content**, **Troubleshooting** or **API/CLI** pages. The Scaleway Documentation team handles the creation of of new **How to**, **Quickstart**, **Concepts** and **FAQ** pages.

### Page format

All Scaleway documentation pages should be `.mdx` files (MDX is an extension to Markdown that lets you include JSX). Any images included within the page must be `.webp` files.

You may use any of our custom MDX components, detailed [on our dedicated page](/components/docs/).

### Page structure

Scaleway Documentation pages should conform to the following structure:

| PAGE TYPE          | DESCRIPTION                                                                              |
| -------------------| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Metadata           | At the top of the page, used for indexing, search and the generation of the page title (H1). The `dates` section is crucial for tracking and displaying when pages were first created and last updated. |
| Introduction       | A few sentences (or short paragraphs), that briefly explain the purpose of the documentation and give any necessary preliminary information. This will be displayed in search results for the page in Scaleway's internal search engine. |
| Requirements       | Bullet points stating what the user must already have accomplished before starting any instructions on this documentation page. Necessary for How tos, Quickstarts and Tutorials. May not be relevant for other page types, e.g. FAQ, Concepts. |
| Page body       | Depends on the [page type](#page-type). You can use H2 and H3 headers to break up and structure the page if necessary. |

If you are creating a new page, it may be easiest to duplicate an existing page and adapt it to your requirements. See the raw files on our GitHub repo for this purpose, for example [this tutorial](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scaleway/docs-content/main/tutorials/install-openvpn/index.mdx).

More information about the different sections of each page can be found by following the links in the table above to the appendix.

### Introduction: Example and guidance

```
In this tutorial, you will learn how to use **Loki** and **Grafana** to collect your Kubernetes logs on a [Kapsule cluster](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/).

Loki is a log aggregation system inspired by **Prometheus**. It is easy to operate, as it does not index the content of the Kubernetes logs but sets labels for log streams. Your metadata (object labels) can be used in Loki for scraping Kubernetes logs. If you use Grafana for metrics, Loki will allow you to have a single point of management for both logging and monitoring.
```

The introduction should be a few sentences, or a few short paragraphs, which explain the purpose of the documentation, and why it may be of interest to users. Briefly explain any third-party products or key features. Include links to other relevant pages where necessary.
