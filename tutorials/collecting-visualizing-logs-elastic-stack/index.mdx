The Elastic Stack, formerly known as the ELK Stack, is a powerful suite of open-source tools designed for real-time data search, analysis, and visualization. It offers comprehensive capabilities for collecting, processing, and visualizing large volumes of data. Its components are:

- **[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch)**: A distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine based on the Lucene library.
- **[Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/logstash)**: A flexible data collection, processing, and enrichment pipeline.
- **[Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana)**: A visualization and exploration tool for analyzing and visualizing data stored in Elasticsearch.
- **[Beats](https://www.elastic.co/beats/)**: Lightweight data shippers for ingesting data into Elasticsearch or Logstash.

- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)

## Install Elasticsearch

1. Download and install the Elasticsearch signing key:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-archive-keyring.gpg
   ```

2. Add the Elasticsearch repository:
   ```bash
   echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-archive-keyring.gpg] https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/8.x/apt stable main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-8.x.list
   ```

3. Update the `apt` package repositories:
   ```bash
   apt update
   ```

4. Install Elasticsearch:
   ```bash
   apt install elasticsearch
   ```

5. Start and enable the Elasticsearch service:
   ```bash
   systemctl start elasticsearch
   systemctl enable elasticsearch
   ```

6. Configure Elasticsearch for production:
   Modify the `elasticsearch.yml` file to optimize Elasticsearch for production use:
   ```bash
   nano /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
   ```

   Add the following:
   ```yaml
   cluster.name: "my-cluster"
   node.name: "node-1"
   network.host: 0.0.0.0
   xpack.security.enabled: true
   xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
   xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true
   xpack.security.http.ssl.keystore.path: /etc/elasticsearch/certs/keystore.p12
   xpack.security.http.ssl.truststore.path: /etc/elasticsearch/certs/truststore.p12
   ```

   <Message type="note">
     Make sure you have SSL certificates set up for secure communication.
   </Message>


## Install and configure Logstash

1. Install Logstash using the same repository added for Elasticsearch:
   ```bash
   apt install logstash
   ```

2. Create and modify configuration files for Logstash:
   The configuration files for Logstash are typically located in `/etc/logstash/conf.d/`. You can create pipelines to manage your data processing.

3. Start and enable the Logstash service:
   ```bash
   systemctl start logstash
   systemctl enable logstash
   ```

## Install and configure Kibana

1. Install Kibana:
   ```bash
   apt install kibana
   ```

2. Start and enable the Kibana service:
   ```bash
   systemctl start kibana
   systemctl enable kibana
   ```

3. Configure Kibana for remote access:
   By default, Kibana is accessible on `http://localhost:5601`. To make Kibana accessible remotely, edit the Kibana configuration file:
   ```bash
   nano /etc/kibana/kibana.yml
   ```

   Change the server host to:
   ```yaml
   server.host: "0.0.0.0"
   ```

4. Secure Kibana: 
   Ensure Kibana uses SSL to encrypt communications by adding SSL certificates in the `kibana.yml` file:
   ```yaml
   server.ssl.enabled: true
   server.ssl.certificate: /etc/kibana/certs/kibana.crt
   server.ssl.key: /etc/kibana/certs/kibana.key
   elasticsearch.ssl.certificate: /etc/kibana/certs/kibana.crt
   elasticsearch.ssl.key: /etc/kibana/certs/kibana.key
   ```

## Install and configure Filebeat

1. Install Filebeat:
   ```bash
   apt install filebeat
   ```

2. Configure Filebeat to ship logs to Elasticsearch:
   Edit the Filebeat configuration file to point to your Elasticsearch instance:
   ```bash
   nano /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml
   ```

   Set the output to Elasticsearch:
   ```yaml
   output.elasticsearch:
     hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]
   ```

   Alternatively, configure Filebeat to send logs to Logstash:
   ```yaml
   output.logstash:
     hosts: ["localhost:5044"]
   ```

3. Start and enable the Filebeat service:
   ```bash
   systemctl enable filebeat
   systemctl start filebeat
   ```

## Secure the Elastic Stack

Securing your Elastic Stack is essential, especially if exposed to the internet. Following are some recommendations:

- Enable built-in security features (as shown above in Elasticsearch and Kibana setup).

- Use a firewall:
   You can use `ufw` or `iptables` to restrict access to only the necessary IPs:
   ```bash
   ufw allow from <your_ip> to any port 9200
   ufw allow from <your_ip> to any port 5601
   ```

- Set up an HTTPS reverse proxy:
   You can secure Kibana by setting up an HTTPS reverse proxy with Nginx:
   [Set up an HTTPS reverse proxy with Nginx](https://www.scaleway.com/docs/tutorials/nginx-reverse-proxy/).

- Set up TLS/SSL for Elasticsearch and Kibana: Ensure communications are encrypted between components using SSL/TLS as shown above.


## Test the installation

After completing the setup, you can verify if everything is working:

- Elasticsearch:
   Run the following command to check Elasticsearch health:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty"
   ```

- Kibana:
   Navigate to `http://your_server_ip:5601` in your web browser.

- Filebeat:
   Ensure logs are being shipped by checking the status:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "localhost:5601/api/status"
   ```

Now, you should have a basic Elastic stack up and running! Adjust configurations as needed for your specific use case and further secure and optimize your setup for production use.
Refer to the [official Elastic documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/index.html) for the most accurate and up-to-date instructions and advanced configuration information.
