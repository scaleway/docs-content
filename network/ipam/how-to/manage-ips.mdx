You can use [IPAM](/network/ipam/concepts/#ipam) to manage [private IP addresses](/network/ipam/concepts/#private-ip-address) that are either attached to one of your resources on a Private Network, or [reserved via the IPAM API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/ipam/#path-ips-book-a-new-ip).

The management actions currently available include:
- Viewing the details of a private IP address, including its ID, tags, creation date and to which resource (if any) it is attached
- Editing the tags of a private IP address

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- At least one resource [attached to a Private Network](/network/vpc/how-to/attach-resources-to-pn/).

## How to view the details of a private IP address

1. Click **IPAM** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu.

    A list of your **private IP addresses** for the **region** and **VPC** pre-selected in the filters displays. Addresses are displayed here if they are reserved in IPAM (either manually reserved via the [IPAM API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/ipam/#path-ips-book-a-new-ip)), or attached to a resource [on a Private Network](/network/vpc/how-to/attach-resources-to-pn/).

2. Modify the filters of the list using the drop-down menus at the top if necessary to display the required IP address.

3. Click **Apply filters** to activate the filters you chose, or **Reset** to reset all filters.
