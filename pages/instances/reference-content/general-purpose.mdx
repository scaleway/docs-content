An Instance is a virtual machine in the cloud. Scaleway supports several [types of Instances](/instances/reference-content/choosing-instance-type/), each with their own set of resources, unique value propositions, and technical specifications. Each Instance supports the essential operating systems and distributions, as well as customized [Instantapps](/instances/concepts/#instantapp).

<Message type="tip">
  Both ENT1 and POP2 Instance types have identical hardware specifications, dedicated vCPU allocation, the same pricing structure, and an accelerated booting process.
  However, POP2 Instances offer CPU- and memory-optimized variants for better workload customization. The main difference is that AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) is disabled for POP2 Instances.
  Opting for **POP2 gives access to the latest features** like potential future live migration of instances, keeping your infrastructure updated with evolving demands and technology.
  POP2 Instances are recommended for general workloads, unless your workload specifically needs features unique to ENT1 Instances.

## ENT1 Instances

Scaleway's **General Purpose** range includes Enterprise Instances (ENT1). ENT1 Instances are high-end, dedicated cloud Instances for demanding workloads. They offer the highest consistent performance per core to support real-time applications. In addition, their computing power makes them generally more robust for compute-intensive workloads.

They are best suited for production websites, enterprise applications, high-traffic databases, and any application that requires 100% sustained CPU usage such as monitoring and analytics software. This includes Prometheus and Grafana, gaming sessions, and ad serving.

See below the technical specifications of Enterprise Instances:
