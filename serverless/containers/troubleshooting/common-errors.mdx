## Unable to deploy the image

### Possible solutions

- Make sure the container is listening on the specified PORT for HTTP requests (or use variable `$PORT`).

- Make sure the container is bound to `0.0.0.0`.

- Containers cannot start due to insufficient provisioned resources. Update your container's resources by provisioning more memory and more vCPU.

- Make sure you built your image for an `amd64` architecture, as `arm64` is not supported. See [Architecture](/serverless/containers/reference-content/containers-limitations/#Architecture) documentation.

- Make sure your deployment does not exceed the limitations of [Serverless Containers](/serverless/containers/reference-content/containers-limitations/).

  <Message type="tip">
    Run the [`docker inspect`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/inspect/) command to get detailed information on your image:
    ```
    docker inspect myimage
    ```

## Failed to create a namespace

### Cause

This issue can happen for the following reasons:

- You created too many namespaces and reached [your account's quota](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/additional-content/organization-quotas/#serverless-containers)
- You created too many Registry namespaces and reached [your account's quota](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/additional-content/organization-quotas/#container-registry)

### Possible solutions

Make sure that you did not exceed the maximum number of allowed namespaces with the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) or with the [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-containers/#path-namespaces-list-all-your-namespaces).
