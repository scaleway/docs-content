## Overview of the v1 API evolution

The transition from `v1beta1` to `v1` for Scaleway Serverless Containers introduces significant improvements in security, resource management, and flexibility.
Users of the API, CLI, and Terraform must note several key updates to field names and behaviors.

This document only covers changes to Serverless Containers. The Serverless Functions and Serverless Jobs APIs remain unchanged.

<Message type="note">Pay attention to the `Breaking changes` sections.</Message>

## Key improvements

### Advanced Triggers and Cron management

Triggers have been redesigned to offer more granular control over how containers are invoked.

- **Unified CRONs:** CRONs are now managed as a specific type of trigger. This simplifies resource management by using the `/triggers` route for all event sources.
- **Custom HTTP paths and headers:** You can now specify a custom HTTP path (for example: `/my-trigger`) and custom headers for any trigger, providing better integration with application logic.
- **Self-managed credentials:** For SQS and NATS triggers, you must now provide your own IAM credentials. This improvement prevents accidental trigger failures caused by deleted system-generated credentials and enables more flexibility, such as triggering a Scaleway container from an SQS queue hosted on your Instance.
- **Container privacy update:** Changing Container privacy no longer requires recreating triggers, the system now handles it automatically.

### Automatic Deployment

In the `v1` API, the `deploy = true` flag is no longer required. `CreateContainer` API calls and container updates will now automatically deploy the container immediately. This aligns Serverless Containers with the standard behavior of all other Scaleway products.

### IAM Authentication

JWT-based authentication is being gradually deprecated in favor of IAM credentials. The deprecation will be effective once IAM credentials provide the same granularity as JWTs. Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/serverless-functions/how-to/migrate-jwt-to-iam-authentication/) for more information.

### Container Registry namespaces

Creating a Serverless Containers namespace no longer creates a `funcscw` Container Registry namespace automatically.

This change allows for greater control over the organization of Container Registry namespaces, and avoids quota errors when creating Container namespaces.

### Health Checks

In addition to health checks, Startup Probes have been introduced. These allow advanced users to define a specific check that runs only during the initial boot of the container, preventing the system from prematurely restarting slow-starting applications.

A new field, `timeout`, allows customization of the duration before the check times out.

## Breaking changes

<Message type="warning">
  If you call the Scaleway Serverless Containers API directly via HTTP calls,
  you must pay attention to the following breaking changes.
</Message>

When using the product via higher-level clients such as [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com/), [CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli), [SDK](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/scaleway-sdk/), or [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/scaleway/scaleway/latest/docs), the impacts are minimal.

### API field changes

To provide a seamless experience across all Scaleway products, the following fields have been updated:

| `v1beta1` name            | `v1` name                   | Unit change  | Notes                                         |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `memory_limit`            | `memory_limit_bytes`        | MiB to Bytes |                                               |
| `local_storage_limit`     | `local_storage_limit_bytes` | MiB to Bytes |                                               |
| `domain_name`             | `public_endpoint`           | N/A          | To differentiate public and private endpoints |
| `health_check`            | `liveness_probe`            | N/A          | Was a readiness probe in `v1beta1`            |
| `cpu_limit`               | `mvcpu_limit`               | N/A          | Precision of the unit                         |
| `http_option: Redirected` | `https_connections_only`    | N/A          | Now a boolean value                           |
