import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'


This page shows you how to create, update, and delete Cockpit [data exports](/cockpit/concepts/#data-exports) from the Scaleway console.

<Requirements />

  - A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Project
  - Created [Scaleway products integrated into Cockpit](/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-product-integration/)


<Message type="important">
 - Data exports only concern Scaleway metrics and logs, and only for [Scaleway products integrated into Cockpit](/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-product-integration). Some products export metrics but do not generate logs.
 - Data collection begins only once the export is created. Any data collected beforehand will not be included in the export.

## How to create a data export

1. Click **Cockpit** in the **Monitoring** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Cockpit** overview page displays.
2. In the **Region** drop-down, select the region where your resources are located.
3. Click the **Data sources** tab.
4. Click the **Settings** icon of the Scaleway data source (metrics or logs), from which you want to export data. The data source's **Overview** tab displays.
5. Click **Create** under the **Data exports** section.

    <Message type="tip">
         If you have already created an export, navigate to your data source's **Settings** tab and click **Create export** in the dedicated section.
    </Message>
5. Choose an export destination:

    <Tabs>
        <TabsTab label="Datadog">
            6. Enter the URL of your Datadog site in the **URL** field. For example `https://api.datadoghq.eu/` for metrics or `https://http-intake.logs.datadoghq.eu/` for logs.

            7. Enter your Datadog API key in the **Datadog API Key** field.
        </TabsTab>
        <TabsTab label="Open Telemetry">
            6. Enter your Open Telemetry endpoint in the **URL** field.
            7. Click **+ Add header** to add a header and attach extra information, like credentials or metadata, to your HTTP requests.
            8. Enter your token in the **Key** field.
            9. Enter your token value in the **Value** field.
            10. Optionally, click **+ Add header** to add more headers.
        </TabsTab>
    </Tabs>
6. In the **Products** drop-down, choose products whose metrics/logs you want to export.
        <Message type="note">
         - Only products that provide metrics/logs to Cockpit are eligible for export. Find out which products are eligible in the [dedicated documentation](/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-product-integration).
         - Selecting **All current and future products** means that all present Scaleway resources sending metrics/logs to Cockpit, and any future ones you create, will automatically be exported.
        </Message>
7. In the **Data export details** section, enter a name for your data export, and optionally add a description.
8. Review your purchase summary and click **Create data export** to confirm.

Your export displays in your data source's **Settings** tab, under the **Data exports** section.

  <Message type="note">
   - The volume of exported data can vary over time, depending on your infrastructure and workload. For example, creating more Instances increases metrics, and busy Serverless Functions generate more logs.
   - Data exports are created at the **data source level**. If you want to export data from several regions or Projects, you must create one export per region/Project.
   - You can create multiple exports per data source if needed (e.g., sending data to different external tools).
   - Export creation may take a few minutes to complete and start exporting data to your endpoint.
   - Scaleway products may send metrics at different intervals (1 or 5 minutes).

## How to update a data export

1. Click **Cockpit** in the **Monitoring** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Cockpit** overview page displays.
2. Click the **Data sources** tab, then the Scaleway data source you want to edit the export of.
3. Click the **Settings** tab.
4. Click the <Icon name="seeMore" /> icon next to the data export you want to edit, then click **Edit**.
5. Edit your data export as necessary, then click **Edit data export** to confirm.

## How to delete a data export

1. Click **Cockpit** in the **Monitoring** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Cockpit** overview page displays.
2. Click the **Data sources** tab, then the data source you want to delete the export of.
3. Click the **Settings** tab.
4. Click the <Icon name="delete" /> icon next to the data export you want to delete. A pop-up appears.
5. Type **DELETE** and click **Delete export** to confirm.

        <Message type="important">
        - Deleting an export stops forwarding data to the export destination.
        - Deletion may take a few minutes before the change becomes fully effective.
        </Message>

## How to monitor data exports

You can monitor your data exports in real time from your Cockpit Grafana dashboard.

You are **responsible for how your exported data is used** and for **any changes in resource volume**. Adding resources naturally increases the number of generated metrics and logs, and the exported volume may fluctuate even without manual action (for example, autoscaling creates additional resources, resulting in more data to export).
