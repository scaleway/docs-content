The Block storage API allows you to interact with Block Storage volumes programmatically through API calls. Refer to the [Developers reference website](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/block/) for more information on how to use the Block Storage API.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
- A [Block Storage volume](/instances/api-cli/creating-a-volume/)

1. Run the command below to list your Block Storage volumes. Do not forget to replace the `{zone}` placeholder with the desired Availability Zone (`fr-par-1`, `nl-ams-2`, etc.):
    ```
    curl -X GET \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
    "https://api.scaleway.com/block/v1alpha1/zones/{zone}/volumes"
    ```

    An output similar to the following displays:

    ```
    {"volume": {"creation_date": "2020-06-02T08:04:50.094118+00:00", "server": null, "id": "<VOLUME_ID>", "size": 25000000000, "name": "myAwesomeVolume", "zone": "<REGION>", "export_uri": null, "volume_type": "b_ssd", "modification_date": "2020-06-02T08:04:50.094118+00:00", "state": "available", "organization": "<ORGANIZATION_ID>"}}
    ```

2. To modify the volume size, run the request below. Do not forget to replace the placeholders with the appropriate value:
    ```
    curl -X PATCH \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"size" : "{size_in_bytes}"}' \
    "https://api.scaleway.com/block/v1alpha1/zones/{zone}/volumes/{volume_id}"
    ```
    <Message type="note">
    You can only increase the size of a Block Storage volume. Reducing its size is not permitted due to technical constraints.
    </Message>
    An output similar to the following displays:
    ```
    {"volume": {"creation_date": "2020-06-02T08:04:50.094118+00:00", "server": null, "id": "VOLUME_ID", "size": 26000000000, "name": "new_name", "zone": "REGION", "export_uri": null, "volume_type": "b_ssd", "modification_date": "2020-06-02T08:08:27.385208+00:00", "state": "resizing", "organization": "ORGANIZATION_ID"}}
    ```

The size of your volume has been updated.
