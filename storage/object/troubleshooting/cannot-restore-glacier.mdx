## Problem

I need to retrieve my data from Scaleway Glacier, but the restore operation does not seem to function.

## Cause

The time it takes to restore an object depends on the size of the object and if [multipart](/storage/object/concepts/#multipart) is configured. If your object is larger than 1 MB, it can take anywhere from a few minutes to 24 hours for restore to start.

## Solution
 
Run the following command in a terminal to retrieve the metadata of the object you want to restore:

```sh
aws s3api head-object --bucket <bucket-name> --key <object-name>
```

An output similar to the following displays:

```sh
{
    "AcceptRanges": "bytes",
    "Restore": "ongoing-request=\"true\"",
    "LastModified": "2024-03-13T16:30:44+00:00",
    "ContentLength": 5,
    "ETag": "\"sd11r084349bc25d97e29393ced1d\"",
    "ContentType": "application/octet-stream",
    "Metadata": {},
    "StorageClass": "GLACIER"
}
```
    
The `"Restore": "ongoing-request=\"true\"",` line indicates that the restore operation has already started.

## Going further

- Refer to the documentation on [how to restore objects from Glacier](/storage/object/how-to/restore-an-object-from-glacier/) for more information.

- If you did not manage to identify the error and solve it by yourself, [open a support ticket](/console/account/how-to/open-a-support-ticket/), and provide as many details as possible, along with the necessary information below:
    - S3 Endpoint (e.g. `s3.fr-par.scw.cloud`)
    - Bucket name
    - Object name (if the request concerns an object)
    - Request type (PUT, GET, etc.)
    - HTTP status code
    - Date and time (timestamp)
    - User-agent (SDK, client, console, etc.)
    - Transaction ID (if possible)
    - Log / trace of the error (if possible)
