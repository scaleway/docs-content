This page shows how to create a Scaleway Web Hosting plan. Web Hosting is a managed service, designed for personal use, business use and everything in between. It allows you to host your website and databases and create personalized email addresses using your domain name.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Registered a domain name](/domains-and-dns/how-to/register-internal-domain/) at Scaleway or another registrar

## Web Hosting configuration

1. Click **Web Hosting** in the **Domains & Web Hosting** section of the side menu.
2. Click **+ Order Web Hosting** to order a Web Hosting plan. The Web Hosting configuration screen displays.
3. Select the region in which to create your Web Hosting.
4. Choose a management interface for your website's content and settings:

    - cPanel is a web-based control panel for managing web hosting accounts, emails, and websites through a graphical interface.

    - WordPress is a user-friendly content management system (CMS) that lets you create, edit, and manage your website without needing to code or technical skills.

         **If you choose WordPress as your management interface:**

         - You will receive a direct access link to your email box
         - Each WordPress hosting plan supports **only one website**
         - You cannot create additional databases beyond the one that is automatically provided
         Find out more about what the WordPress plan includes in the [Web Hosting FAQ](/webhosting/faq/)

5. Choose your hosting plan based on your needs.
6. Configure options:
     - Enable backup: for daily automated backups of your website, emails, and databases. Retains backups for three days, with a full weekly backup retained for two months.
     - Dedicated IP: for improving email reputation and SSL setup.
7. Enter your email address. We will send you your password to access your management interface to this email address.
8. Click **Configure domain**.


## Domain configuration

**Choose one of the following option to define which domain you want to link to your Web Hosting.**

    <Tabs>
        <TabsTab label="Use free Scaleway subdomain">
        This option allows you to create and access your Web Hosting service immediately, without needing to add a custom domain. You can later configure a personalized domain via cPanel if you wish.

            1. Enter a subdomain.

            2. Click the search icon to confirm.

            3. Click **Order Web Hosting**.
        </TabsTab>
        <TabsTab label="Use my own domain">
        This option allows you to use your own domain and skip the subdomain selection. A random subdomain will automatically be assigned in parallel to your custom domain. This ensures that your website remains accessible at all times via the assigned subdomain, even if your custom domain is not yet configured.

                Choose between **External domain or register later**, and **Scaleway domain** to add your website domain.

                3. Tick **Use a subdomain** if you want to use an existing subdomain or to create a new one.
                    <Message type="tip">
                        You can use a subdomain if you want to create a separate section of your website, such as a blog, or shop, if you are not using the main domain for this project.

                        For example, if your main website is `my-cookies.com`, you could use a subdomain like `recipes.my-cookies.com` to create a separate section for sharing cookie recipes, while keeping your main site focused on selling cookies.

                4. Enter the name of your existing subdomain or a new name to create a subdomain.

                6. Click **Order Web Hosting**.
