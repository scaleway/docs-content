Nextcloud is an open-source, self-hosted file share, and communication platform.

It provides a large portfolio of [different applications](https://nextcloud.com/install/#install-clients) to access your cloud storage from your PC, Mac, or mobile device.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An [Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) running Ubuntu Jammy Jellyfish (22.04 LTS)
- `sudo` privileges or access to the root user

## Installing Nextcloud

1. Log in to your server:
    ```
    ssh root@SERVER_IP_ADDRESS
    ```
2. Update the APT package manager and upgrade the software already installed on your Instance to the latest version.
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
3. Install Nextcloud via [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/):
    ```
    snap install nextcloud
    ```
4. Run the following command to finish the installation. Make sure that you replace `your-username` and `your-password` with credentials of your choice, and that you note them as you will need them to login to your Nextcloud Instance.
    ```
    nextcloud.manual-install your-username your-password
    ```

    The following output should display:

    `Nextcloud was successfully installed`

## Configuring trusted domains

By default, access to your Nextcloud Instance is limited to `localhost`. To access it via your domain name, you have to add it to the list of trusted domains.

Run the following command to allow the connection via the domain `your.domain.com` to your Nextcloud.
    ```
    nextcloud.occ config:system:set trusted_domains 1 --value=your.domain.com
    ```

The following message should appear, confirming that the domain was added: `System config value trusted_domains => 1 set to string your-domain.com`

## Securing the web interface with a Let's Encrypt TLS/SSL certificate

By default, the Nextcloud installation via Snap provides a plain HTTP connection which is not encrypted. This may be a potential security risk when transferring your data over the internet.

[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) provides free TLS/SSL certificates to encrypt the connection to your Nextcloud instance.

1. The snap package relies on the `resolvconf` package to resolve DNS requests, which is not installed on Ubuntu by default. Install it using the APT package manager:
    ```
    apt install resolvconf
    ```
2. Enable SSL and request a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate:
    ```
    nextcloud.enable-https lets-encrypt
    ```
2. The following message will appear, confirm it by pressing `y` on your keyboard:
    ```
    In order for Let's Encrypt to verify that you actually own the
    domain(s) for which you're requesting a certificate, there are a
    number of requirements of which you need to be aware:

    1. In order to register with the Let's Encrypt ACME server, you must
      agree to the currently-in-effect Subscriber Agreement located
      here:

          https://letsencrypt.org/repository/

      By continuing to use this tool you agree to these terms. Please
      cancel now if otherwise.

    2. You must have the domain name(s) for which you want certificates
      pointing at the external IP address of this machine.

    3. Both ports 80 and 443 on the external IP address of this machine
      must point to this machine (e.g. port forwarding might need to be
      setup on your router).

    Have you met these requirements? (y/n)
    ```
3. Enter your email address when prompted and confirm by pressing **Enter**:
    ```
    Please enter an email address (for urgent notices or key recovery): you@your.domain.com
    ```
4. Enter the domain name that you have configured in a previous step for your Instance (`your.domain.com` in our case), then confirm by pressing **Enter**:
    ```
    Please enter your domain name(s) (space-separated): your.domain.com
    ```
The following output should display once the certificate has been obtained:
    ```
    Attempting to obtain certificates... done
    Restarting apache... done
    ```

## Accessing Nextcloud

You can now access your Nextcloud Instance.

1. Open your browser and type the address of your Instance (For example: `https://your.domain.com`). A login screen displays.
2. Enter the username and password that you have created in the previous steps. Your personal cloud storage space displays.
3. Upload, share, or download files from the interface:
    <Lightbox image={image} alt="" />
4. Optionally, download one of the several [Nextcloud clients](https://nextcloud.com/install/#install-clients) to manage your cloud storage space directly from your computer.
