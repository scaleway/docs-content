## Problem

I can't see metrics partially or totally for my Serverless Job.

## Cause

Metrics for Serverless Jobs are technically limited for very short jobs under `15` seconds.

## Possible solutions

- If your job takes more than `15` seconds and metrics are still missing, it can be due to a [scheduled maintenance](https://status.scaleway.com/). If this is not the case, you can open a support ticket to report the issue. 
- For very short jobs, you can add `sleep` to your workflow if you need the metrics.
