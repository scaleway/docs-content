Reverse DNS is the opposite of classic "forward" DNS and maps an IP address to a hostname. This can be useful if, for example, you want to send emails from your server.

<Message type="important">
  Using the default reverse DNS (*.pub.instances.scw.cloud) may lead to issues with the deliverability of your emails and subscription to tools like [Junk Mail Reporting Program](https://postmaster.live.com/snds/JMRP.aspx) (JMRP) and [Smart Network Data Services](https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/snds/FAQ.aspx#WhatIsSNDS), Microsoft services to whitelist your IPâ€™s on their email servers.

  - You have an account and are logged into [console.scaleway.com](https://console.scaleway.com) 
  - You have [created an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) and have not detached its public (flexible) IP address
  - You have configured a matching `A-record` pointing to your IP address. Note that if you have created the A record recently, it may take up to 24 hours for the operation to be completed.

## How to set up a reverse DNS record

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The [Instances page](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) displays.
2. Click the **Flexible IPs** tab.
3. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the IP address you wish to configure reverse DNS for and select **Edit reverse** from the drop-down menu.
4. Enter the reverse DNS you want to associate with the IP address. Generally this corresponds to your hostname.
5. Click **Edit reverse** to finish.

      Once the reverse DNS has been updated, it may take up to 24 hours before it is fully propagated.
