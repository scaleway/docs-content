<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net)
  - You have created a **Webhosting Classic**
  - You have created an [email account](/webhosting/classic/how-to/create-email-account)

</Message>

1. Log into the [Scaleway webmail interface](https://webmail.online.net/). 
2. Verify if your emails are available from the Scaleway webmail interface.

    <Message type="note">

    - If you can connect to your email account using the Scaleway webmail, the problem you are experiencing might come from the configuration of your computer.
        
    </Message>

3. Verify the [configuration of your client](/webhosting/classic/how-to/check-emails). 

    <Message type="note">

    - Some email clients cut the domain part of your email address in the username by default. For example with the email address “[firstname.lastname@example.com](mailto:firstname.lastname@example.com)”, your client cuts it to “firstname.lastname”. Make sure to enter your complete email address as your username. 
          
    </Message>

4. Verify your username and make sure to use your entire email address (for example "[firstname.lastname@example.com](mailto:firstname.lastname@example.com)").
