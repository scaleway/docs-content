## How am I billed for Scaleway services?

All Public Cloud services are based on the "pay as you go" model, which means that you only pay for what you use.

Your monthly invoice is calculated at the end of each month and based on your hourly resource usage during the month.

<Message type="important">
  Some of our products are invoiced separately.
</Message>

For example:
The Stardust1-s indicated at €0,0025 excl/hour can be split up as follows:
- €0.00198/hour for the IP
- €0.0004/hour for the 10 GB of local storage
- €0.00012/hour for the instance

For more information, refer to our dedicated [pricing page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/).

## When does the billing of an Instance start and stop?

The final price of your Instance is calculated according to the characteristics of your resource. Each of these resources is billed separately for a minimum of 60 minutes.

Each uninterrupted period between a start and a stop billing event will be considered a unique resource. It is the number of these unique resources noted within a month that are displayed in the consumption table of your invoice.

Below is a detailed list of what is considered start and stop billing events for each resource class:

  | Resource type         | Billing Starts                                                                            | Billing Stops                                                                               | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## What does pro-rata billing for Dedibox and Web Hosting services mean?

You are billed pro-rata for the initial month of a subscription. This means the charge is adjusted to reflect the portion of the first month you used the service.
Starting from the second month and onwards, you are billed in full at the beginning of each month, covering the entire upcoming billing period in advance.
This billing model ensures that you pay for the service based on your actual usage for the first month and then in advance for subsequent months.

## How to read my invoice?

Refer to the [Reading an invoice](/console/billing/additional-content/reading-an-invoice) documentation page for a detailed description of your invoices.

## When are invoices issued?

Invoices are issued each month based on the resource consumption of the previous month.
Our reference billing period is the definition of a calendar month in the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) time zone.
The automatic payment of invoices occurs in the first few days of a month, once the invoice is issued and is processed by using the preferred payment method of your account.

## How can I manage my billing?

You can manage your billing from the [billing section](https://console.scaleway.com/billing/overview) of the Scaleway console. Your recent invoices as well as the consumption report for the current month are available for download.
Alternatively, you can retrieve your consumption information and download your invoices using the [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/billing/).

## What does the status of my invoice mean?

The status of an invoice can be:
* **Draft**: Refers to the invoice for the current calendar month. The billing period has not yet finished, so the invoice is not finalized and is subject to change.
* **Stopped**: Refers to invoices where the billing period (calendar month) has ended, but the invoice is not yet issued.
* **Issued**: Refers to a final invoice awaiting payment. It has a unique number and is non-repudiable. The invoice charges for the resources consumed over the corresponding billing period.
* **Paid**: Refers to a fully paid invoice. No further action is required.
* **Incomplete**: Refers to invoices where the user has provided incorrect billing details or payment information, or elements of this information are missing. The user must update this information as soon as possible to avoid having their account deleted.
* **Outdated**: Refers to invoices where there has been a change in billing information, for example, a discount has been applied, or the client has amended their billing details. An updated invoice will be issued soon.

## Do the prices shown on the website include EU VAT?

Prices announced on our website exclude all taxes.

Because we are a European company, we are required to charge VAT on all orders made by European individual customers (B2C).
The appropriate VAT rate is automatically applied to your invoice, depending on your fiscal residence. Just make sure the administrative details on your profile, such as postal address, recipient name, and phone number are in order.
No other additional taxes, but European VAT is collected.

If you are not located in one of the 27 member states of the European Union, no other tax will be added to your invoice, per application of EU laws.
European B2B customers are exempted from VAT, as long as they provide a registered VAT number. Just add your VAT registry number to your profile, and your invoice will be updated accordingly.

If you do not provide a valid VAT number, you will be considered an individual customer (B2C), and the local rate will be applied.

## Which payment methods does Scaleway accept?

We accept Visa, MasterCard, CB, UnionPay, and American Express.

## How can I pay my invoice?

We automatically initiate one payment transaction from your preferred payment method at the start of each new month. Once an invoice is issued, you have 10 days to regularize it (see section 6.3 of our Terms of Service). As a reminder, the due date of payment is displayed on each invoice once issued.

If the automatic payment fails, you will be notified by mail of payment failure and invited to initiate a new transaction from your account.

If after several manual attempts you cannot manage to trigger a successful transaction, you may add another credit card. Keep in mind to make this card the active card and re-initiate a payment transaction.

<Message type="note">
  Failed SEPA payments can only be regularized by credit or debit card payment.
</Message>

<Message type="important">
  If you are unable to settle your invoice after the due date, your account is going to be suspended and your resources will be unreachable. You will then have another ten days to regularize your invoice before your resources are deleted.
</Message>

## How can I add a billing contact to my account?

The billing contact is an additional contact linked to your account which will receive your monthly invoices. This can be useful if invoices in your Organization are handled by another department.
You can add a billing contact directly from the User Account section of your Scaleway console.

1. Log into your Scaleway console.
2. On the Organization drop-down menu, click **Billing**. The billing section displays.
3. Enter the new billing contact e-mail address.
4. Click **Save**.
    <Message type="important">
      The billing contact is only an administrative contact. It can not be used to connect to the Scaleway console.
    </Message>

## How can I obtain a SEPA Mandate?

Refer to the [How to add a payment method](/console/billing/how-to/add-payment-method#how-to-add-a-sepa-mandate) documentation page for a complete guide on how to add a SEPA mandate.

## My credit card validation code expired. What should I do?

If your validation code expires, please [contact our support team](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create) to request a new code.

## I tried to add a credit card but received the message 'Card already registered'

A credit card can only be registered once across all Organizations. If you receive this message, make sure you do not have the same card already registered to another Scaleway account.

If you only have one payment method and need to use it on more than one account, [contact our support team](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create) to request an individual verification.

## I've added a physical credit card, but it was declined. Why?

If your credit card complies with the payment requirements but still was declined, please [contact our support team](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create) for assistance.

## I added a credit card but didn’t receive a magic code. What do I do?

It usually takes up to 24 hours to receive a magic code.

If after that period you still don't receive it, contact your bank or credit card provider for assistance or [contact our support team](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create) to request a new code.

## How long does it take to receive a magic code?

Usually, the magic code (transaction code) shows up in your bank statement in up to 24 hours.

## Why can’t I delete my credit card?

You must always have a valid credit card registered to your account. So if you have only one credit card registered, it will not be possible to delete it from your account, even if you use a SEPA debit as payment method.

It is also not possible to remove a credit card from your account if you have one or more outstanding invoices. If that is the case, make sure you have paid any issued invoice(s) and have no consumption in the current calendar month, and retry.

If your case does not match the situations above and you still cannot remove your credit card, [contact our support team](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create) for a manual verification.

## How can I change the country or region registered to my account?

It is not possible to edit your country and region directly from the Scaleway console. Please [contact our support team](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create) if you need to change this information.

Be prepared to inform us of your your new address, including country, region, city, postal code, and street address. Our team will then proceed to update your account details.

## Why have I been billed for resources that are deactivated or powered off?

If you were billed for resources that have been correctly stopped, please [contact our support team](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create), providing the name of the product and resource, and the date of deactivation.

## Can I use a virtual or prepaid card as a payment method?

No. Virtual or prepaid cards are **not** accepted as payment methods. When using a credit card, ensure you are using a physical card, protected by 3D secure.

## I deleted my account, but still received an invoice. Why?

Scaleway invoices are calculated at the end of each month, so you may receive a final invoice the month after closing your account. That corresponds to your outstanding consumption for your final month of activity.
