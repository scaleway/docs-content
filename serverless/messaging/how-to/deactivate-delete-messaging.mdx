This page shows how to delete a Scaleway **NATS**, account.

Note that it is no longer necessary to deactivate services for **Queues** or **Topics and Events**: simply delete the queues, topics, subscriptions or other associated resources for the product directly.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- At least one [NATS account](/serverless/messaging/how-to/get-started/), [queue](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-queues/), or [topic](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-topics/)

## How to delete a NATS account

1. Click **NATS** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu.

2. Use the drop-down menu to select the [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) containing the NATS account you want to delete.

3. Click the NATS account you want to delete.

4. In the bottom panel, click the **Delete NATS account** button.

    A pop-up displays, reminding you that the action is irreversible, and any associated queued messages and credentials will be deleted.

5. Type `DELETE` and click **Delete NATS account** to confirm.

<Message type="note">
