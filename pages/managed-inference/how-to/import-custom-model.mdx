Scaleway provides a selection of common models for deployment from the Scaleway console. If you need a specific model, you can import it into Managed Inference directly from Hugging Face or a Scaleway Object Storage bucket.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com).

7. Choose a name for your model. The name must be unique within your Organization and Project and cannot be changed later.
8. Click **Verify import** to check your Hugging Face credentials and ensure model compatibility.
9. Review the summary of your import, which includes:
    - Context size by node type.
    - Quantization options.
    - Estimated cost.
   Once checked, click **Begin import** to finalize the process.

Your imported model will now appear in the model library. You can proceed to [deploy your model on Managed Inference](/ai-data/managed-inference/how-to/create-deployment/).
