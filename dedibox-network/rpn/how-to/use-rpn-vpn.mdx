The RPN VPN service allows you to access machines inside your RPN from an external connection or from a Dedibox server that do not have an RPN interface.

The feature is based on [OpenVPN](/tutorials/install-openvpn/) and you can add the RPN VPN to your RPNv1 group like any other server.

The RPN VPN service allows you to:

* Connect from anywhere in your totally secure and private network    
* Connect servers which do not have an RPN interface to the RPN

<Message type="requirement">
  * You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net)
  * You have an RPN-compatible Dedibox dedicated server
  * You have installed an OpenVPN client on your local computer
</Message>


## How to download the RPN VPN configuration

1. Click **Storage** > **RPN VPN** in the top menu of the Dedibox Console. A summary of your RPN VPN services displays.

2. Click **Configure** next to the RPN VPN service you want to configure. The RPN VPN information displays.

    <Message type="tip">
      If you do not have any RPN VPN services yet, you can click **Order RPN VPN** directly on the page.

    <Message type="note">
      To use your RPN VPN in your RPNv1 group, you must add it to your group as an RPN server. For more information follow our [RPN documentation](/dedibox-network/rpn/quickstart/).

## How to configure the RPN VPN client

<Message type="requirement">
  To complete the following steps, you must have the following information available on the client:
    * IP of the RPN VPN server
    * CA Certificate
    * Client Certificate
    * `.key` Certificate
    * RPN VPN Password
</Message>

### How to configure the Linux client

1.  Launch the installation of [OpenVPN](/tutorials/install-openvpn/) using the following command.
    ```
    root@<your-server-ip>:~# apt install openvpn
    ```
2. Edit the client configuration file `/etc/openvpn/client.conf` in a text editor. For example with `nano`: 
    ```
    root@<your-server-ip>:~# nano /etc/openvpn/client.conf
    ```
    
    The configuration file looks like the following example:

    ```
    client
    dev tun
    ;proto tcp
    proto udp
    float
    remote <IP of the RPN VPN server> 1194
    nobind
    persist-key
    persist-tun
    ca <ca.crt>
    cert <cert.crt>
    key <cert.key>
    askpass <password file>
    ns-cert-type server
    comp-lzo
    verb 3
    ```

    Set the following values in the configuration file:

    * `<IP of the RPN VPN server>`: IP of the RPN VPN server
    * `<ca.crt>`: Path to ca.crt
    * `<cert.crt>`: Path to the client .crt
    * `<cert.key>`: Path to the client .key
    * `<password file>`: Path to the file containing your password

    Then save the file and exit the text editor.
3. To start the VPN automatically during the boot process of the server, edit the file `/etc/default/openvpn` and insert the following line:
    ```
    AUTOSTART="client"
    ```

    This line allows [OpenVPN](/tutorials/install-openvpn/) to start automatically with the configuration file located at `/etc/openvpn/client.conf`. 

Once the connection to the RPN VPN server is established, you can use your RPN VPN IP to check whether a new interface displays:

    ```
    root@mydedibox:/etc/default# ifconfig tun0
    tun0      Link encap:UNSPEC  HWaddr 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00  
            inet addr:10.90.250.25  P-t-P:10.90.250.26  Mask:255.255.255.255
    ```

You can also check if the routes for the RPN network were set:

    ```
    root@mydedibox:/etc/default# route -n | grep 10.90
    10.90.0.0       10.90.250.26    255.255.0.0     UG    0      0        0 tun0
    10.90.250.1     10.90.250.26    255.255.255.255 UGH   0      0        0 tun0
    10.90.250.26    0.0.0.0         255.255.255.255 UH    0      0        0 tun0
    ```

Now you can [configure your server](/dedibox-network/rpn/quickstart/) in your RPN group.
