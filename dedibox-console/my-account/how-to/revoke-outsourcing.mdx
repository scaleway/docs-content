Outsourced services are services that have a technical contact different from the service's owner. The technical contact (another Scaleway Dedibox account holder) is able to manage these services without needing to have full access to the owners Scaleway Dedibox account.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net) 
</Message>

The outsourcing of a service can be revoked at any time by either the owner or the other Dedibox account holder.


1. Click your user name next to _logged in as:_ in the top right corner of the console. Then click **Outsourcing** in the pop-up menu.

2. On the outsourcing page click the **Outsourced** tab to see your outsourced services. Tick the checkbox of each service on which you want to revoke the outsourcing:

3. Click **Remove selected roles** to validate the form and revoke the outsourcing of the selected services.

The services disappear from the outsourced account and the technical role is reset to the owner of the service.
