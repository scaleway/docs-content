## Problem

My Serverless Container stopped working (up to several hours) after a redeploy.

## Cause

The new deploy failed, and the [fallback mechanism has been triggered](/serverless-containers/reference-content/containers-limitations/#versioning-and-rollback).

## Possible solution

Identify the element that caused the deployment to fail, fix the error, and deploy the container again.
