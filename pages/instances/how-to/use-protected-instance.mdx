The [Protected Instance](/instances/concepts/#protected-instance) feature is used to prevent any `halt` action from being performed on your Instance. This only applies to running Instances. Enabling the Protected Instance feature means that you will not be able to delete, power off, or reboot your Instance, nor put it into standby mode. This feature is useful to avoid hazardous manipulations, such as batch deletion of Instances.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/)

## How to activate the Protected Instance feature

1. Click **CPU & GPU Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The [Instances page](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) displays.
2. Select the Availability Zone (AZ) from the drop-down menu (e.g., `PAR1`) to view resources in the selected AZ.
3. Click the Instance you want to protect. The **Overview** page for that Instance displays.
4. Click the **Advanced settings** tab.
5. Scroll down to the **Protected Instance** section, and use the <Icon name="toggle" /> toggle to activate the Protected Instance feature.
   A pop-up displays asking you to confirm the action.
6. Click **Enable Protected Instance**.
