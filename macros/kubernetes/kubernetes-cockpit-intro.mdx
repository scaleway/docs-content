Scalewayâ€™s [Cockpit](/cockpit/quickstart/) provides a centralized solution for monitoring and logging in of your Kubernetes applications, helping you gain insights into cluster activity, performance, and security.

With Cockpit, you can:

- **Monitor your Kubernetes cluster**: Gain real-time visibility into the control plane, nodes, managed resources, and system applications.
- **Analyze logs**: View logs from all your Kubernetes containers in one place to enhance observability and simplify troubleshooting.
- **Track activity**: Audit logs provide detailed records of user actions, application API calls, and control plane operations, helping with compliance and security.

Cockpit integrates with **Grafana** for rich data visualization and provides **automated monitoring** without the need to configuure additional infrastructure.

  **Cost considerations**: Sending logs to Cockpit incurs costs based on ingestion volume. See the [Cockpit FAQ](/faq/cockpit/#how-am-i-billed-for-using-cockpit-with-custom-data) for pricing details and best practices.

  **Security & compliance**: Monitoring Kubernetes API activity is critical for security and may be required for certain certifications. Audit logs are enabled by default for clusters with dedicated control planes. Learn more in the [audit logs documentation](/kubernetes/how-to/access-audit-logs/).
