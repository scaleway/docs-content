## How to create a Cluster for Apache Kafka®

1. Click **Apache Kafka®** in the **Data and Analytics** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Clusters for Apache Kafka®a** product page displays.

2. Click **Create cluster**. The creation wizard displays.

3. Select a **region** for the cluster. During Private Beta, clusters are only available in the Paris region.

4. Select a **Kafka® version** to run on the cluster. Only one pre-selected Kafka® version is available during Private Beta.

5. Select the **number of nodes** (brokers) you want in the cluster, either **3 nodes** for a highly-available cluster enabling data replication, or **1 node** for a cluster suitable for testing and development. During Private Beta, the number of nodes cannot be changed after cluster creation.

6. Select a **node type**. Choose between [dedicated or shared nodes](/clusters-for-kafka/concepts/#node), depending on your workload requirements and use case. For shared nodes, various types are available, each offering different cost-performance ratios.

7. Configure **network connectivity**. During Private Beta, connectivity to clusters is facilitated exclusively through **Private Networks**. Select a Private Network from the dropdown list to attach your cluster to.

8. Create **credentials** by defining a username and password. These will be used when connecting to your cluster. During Private Beta, only one user can be created per cluster, and the username is not modifiable after creation (though the password can be changed).

9. Enter a **name**, and (optionally), **tags** to identify your cluster.

10. Check the estimated cost summary, then click **Create cluster**.

Your cluster is created, and you are taken to its **Overview** page in the console.
