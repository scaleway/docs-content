This page shows you how to configure your sending domain to start sending [transactional emails](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#transactional-email).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A domain name

## Automatic configuration for a Scaleway domain

When you use a domain name registered with [Scaleway Domains and DNS](/network/domains-and-dns/), you can benefit from DNS autoconfiguration. We can automatically configure SPF, DKIM, DMARC, MX on your behalf so 
your domain name can be validated automatically and you can focus on sending emails and observing the reputation status of your domain.

1. Click **Transactional Email** in the **Managed Services** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Transactional Email** overview page displays.
2. Click **Add domain**. The domain creation wizard displays.
3. Add your domain. Select **Use Scaleway domain** and choose your Scaleway domain from the drop down list.
4. Optionally, tick the checkbox **Add a domain prefix** to configure a subdomain for use with the Transactional Email service.
4. Tick the checkbox **Configure my Transactional Email DNS records automatically**.
5. Tick the checkbox to confirm that you agree to Scaleway's antispam policy, then click **Validate domain name** to confirm.

## Manual configuration for an external domain

If your domain is registered with an external registrar, you can use it with the Transactional Email service by configuring the required DNS records manually.
Validation time of domain ownership may be extended.

1. Click **Transactional Email** in the **Managed Services** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Transactional Email** overview page displays.
2. Click **Add domain**. The domain creation wizard displays.
3. Enter the domain name you want to use with Transactional Email.
4. Tick the checkbox to confirm that you agree to Scaleway's antispam policy, then click **Validate domain name** to confirm.

<Message type="important">
 For external domains, you need to configure your [SPF](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#spf-record), [DKIM](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#dkim-record) and [MX](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#mx-record) records **manually** to verify your domain and to be able to send emails.
