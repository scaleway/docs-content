import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'

OpenCode is a coding agent for terminal and IDE. You can integrate Scaleway's Generative APIs models to OpenCode.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) for API authentication
- Installed [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) on your local machine

## Configure OpenCode

1. Start OpenCode:
   ```bash
   opencode
   ```
   <Message type="tip">
   If `command not found` displays, ensure you have properly installed opencode and registered the tool in your terminal configuration. After installation, you can launch a new terminal or reload your current terminal configuration with:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc # Or source ~/.zshrc if you use zsh
   ```
   <Message>

2. Press `Ctrl + P` to display commands.

3. Type `provider` to search for commands. Select `Connect provider`, then press `Enter`.

4. Type `scaleway` to search for providers. Select `Scaleway`, then press `Enter`.

5. Enter your `SCW_SECRET_KEY` as API Key. Press `Enter`.

6. Select a model in the list, for instance `Devstral 2 123B Instruct (2512)`.

7. Type any prompt asking opencode to create or update code files. For example:
     ```bash
     "Write a fibonnaci function in python that compute the first 10 fibonnaci numbers"
     ```

## Going further

- You can explore OpenCode additional features and [configure OpenCode using a JSON configuration file](https://opencode.ai/docs/config/).
- By default, requests are performed to `https://api.scaleway.ai/v1` on your Scaleway default project. If you want to perform requests on a specific project (for instance, to track specific billing), edit OpenCode JSON configuration with URL: `https://api.scaleway.ai/###PROJECT_ID###/v1`
