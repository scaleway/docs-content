Scaleway Edge Services has left Public Beta and gone into General Availability. Read on to find out more about this transition.

## Edge Services Public Beta

Edge Services for Object Storage and Load Balancer was in Public Beta until November 1 2024. This meant that the product was ready to be tested by customers, but some features may have been missing, and usage was intended for test environments rather than production. Edge Services was free to use during Public Beta, and was not billed.

## Edge Services General Availability

From **November 1st 2024** Edge Services went into General Availability, for both Object Storage and Load Balancer usage. This means that:
- We considered that the product was ready for production environments.
- The product was no longer be free to use, and is now billed. 

## Edge Services pricing

<Message type="note">
Check out the [Edge Services pricing page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/network/#edge-services) for full pricing details.
</Message>

Edge Services is billed via **subscription**. Three different subscription plans are available, each including different amounts of monthly usage for **cache size** and **number of pipelines**. If your consumption of Edge Services in a given month exceeds the cache size and number of pipelines included in your subscription, you are billed for this extra usage on top of your plan.

<Message type="tip">
An Edge Services pipeline consists of an origin for which Edge Services requests and caches content, and an endpoint from which this content is served via Edge Services. In the case of Object Storage during Public Beta, a pipeline corresponded to a bucket Edge Services was enabled on. If Edge Services was enabled on three different buckets, this equaled three pipelines. In the case of Load Balancer, pipelines were already an explicit concept in the console.

At the start of October 2024, current Edge Services users received an email with full details of the three subscription plans.

Pricing plan details can also be viewed on the [Scaleway pricing page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/network/).

## Transitioning from free to paid use

At the end of October 2024, we automatically selected the most cost-effective subscription plan for each existing Edge Services user, based on their usage. When billing started on the 1st of November 2024, users therefore saw in the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) that they were subscribed to the plan we had selected for them.

Billing for Edge Services is pro rata, and you can cancel or change your subscription plan at any time. 

<Message type="important">
If you did not wish to be billed for Edge Services, you were warned that you must disable it on all your buckets, and delete any Load Balancer pipelines you had created **before November 1st 2024**.
