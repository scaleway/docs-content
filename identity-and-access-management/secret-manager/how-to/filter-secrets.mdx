This page explains how to filter Secret Manager secrets by name, [type](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#secret-types), and tags.

Filtering secrets by name allows you to quickly locate specific secrets, especially in environments with a large number of secrets. This helps in managing and retrieving the required information swiftly.

Filtering secrets by [type](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#secret-types) allows you to categorize your secrets based on their usage (e.g., API keys, passwords, certificates). This helps in managing different types of secrets effectively.

Filtering by tags allows you to categorize your secrets with more flexibility. Unlike rigid hierarchical structures, tags can be applied dynamically to group secrets based on various criteria.

     The search will only return secrets that were created in the path you are currently in. For example, if you have created the `/my-path` and `/my-second-path` paths, and your secret is inside `/my-second-path`, you need to access `/my-second-path` to find your secret.
