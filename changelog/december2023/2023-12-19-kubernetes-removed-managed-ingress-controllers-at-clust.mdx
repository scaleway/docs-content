Ending the [deprecation cycle](/changelog/?a=kubernetes-52c54d18-c203&tags=containers_kubernetes), Kubernetes clusters do not have managed ingresses anymore. Users can deploy a [pre-configured ingress controller](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/deploy-ingress-controller/) after cluster creation using the Easy Deploy feature within the Scaleway console.
