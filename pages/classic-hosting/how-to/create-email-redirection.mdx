A redirection is an alternative email address for one or multiple email accounts of the same domain. For example, you can create the alias [contact@example.com](mailto:contact@example.com), which will redirect the email to the personal email account [firstname.lastname@example.com](mailto:firstname.lastname@example.com).

This allows you to have multiple email addresses without needing to have multiple email accounts. It is also possible to deliver the email to multiple recipients. This means, for our example, we can get the email sent to “contact” delivered to the email accounts “firstname.lastname” and also to “firstname2.lastname2”.
