Virtualization requires in most cases the configuration of additional IP addresses on your dedicated server to provide network connectivity to your virtual machines.

In general two connectivity modes are possible for the networking of virtual machines:

* Bridge
* NAT

### Bridged network

In bridge mode your server and your virtual machines are seen as different servers by the network equipment.
For security reasons, no other network equipment is allowed on our network, except for the MAC address of your physical network card.

If you start a virtual machine in bridge mode, a protection will be activated on the switch and your network port will be closed.
To solve this problem you can add virtual MAC addresses, which are known and are allowed on the network.

### NATed network
With a NAT configuration you share the same IP address for all your virtual machines. Your physical server and its virtual machines are seen as one single server, only the MAC address of your physical network card is broadcasted on the network.
With this configuration no virtual MAC addresses are required. 

## How to add a virtual MAC address

1. Click **Server** > **Server list** to display a list of your physical machines. 

2. Select the server you want to configure and click **Manage**. The servers' status page displays.

3. Scroll down to the network configuration section and click **+ Info** next to the failover IP you want to configure. The advanced configuration displays.

4. Click **Add virtual MAC**. The virtual MAC configuration displays. 

5. Click the cogwheel next to the IP address you want to configure. Then select the type of MAC address and click **Add ... virtual MAC address**.

    <Message type="note">

    Each MAC address is associated with manufacturer/organization. We provide virtual MAC addresses from the following Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI):
    * OUI VMWare: `00:50:56`
    * OUI Xen: `00:16:3e`
    * OUI KVM: `52:54:00`
    You can choose the OUI of your preference. They are technically interchangable.

Once the virtual MAC is activated, use it to configure the network of your VM.

## How to delete a virtual MAC address

You can remove the virtual MAC address associated to a failover IP if you do not require it any longer. 

<Message type="tip">

When you choose to delete a virtual MAC address on an IP address that shares its virtual MAC with other IPs, only the link between this specific IP address and the MAC is deleted, the other IP addresses are not updated.

</Message>

1. Click **Server** > **Server list** to display a list of your physical machines. 

2. Select the server you want to configure and click **Manage**. The servers' status page displays.

3. Scroll down to the network configuration section and click **+ Info** next to the failover IP you want to configure. The advanced configuration displays.

4. Click **Edit**. The virtual MAC configuration displays. 

5. Click the cogwheel next to the IP address you want to configure. Then click **Delete virtual MAC addresss**. 

The configuration of the failover IP will be updated and the virtual MAC address will be deleted.
