The [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) lists your Object Storage incomplete multipart uploads to allow you to consult them, and manually abort them to clear storage space and optimize your storage costs.

<Message type="note">
Incomplete multipart uploads are charged even though they are not finished, as they use storage space.
</Message>

You can automate the process of aborting incomplete multipart uploads using [lifecycle rules](/object-storage/how-to/manage-lifecycle-rules).

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Object Storage bucket](/object-storage/how-to/create-a-bucket/)
- At least one incomplete [multipart upload](/object-storage/api-cli/multipart-uploads/)

## How to view the information of an incomplete multipart upload

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the name of your bucket. The list of your objects displays.
3. Click the **Incomplete MPU** tab. A list of your incomplete multipart uploads displays.
4. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the object you want to consult.
5. Click **More info**. The information page of the incomplete multipart upload displays.

From this page, you can consult the following elements of an incomplete multipart upload:
- Name
- Upload ID
- Creation date
- Storage class
- List of parts uploaded so far

Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/object-storage/api-cli/multipart-uploads/) for more information on how to create and manage multipart uploads.
