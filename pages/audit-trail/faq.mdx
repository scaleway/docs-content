## Overview

### What is Audit Trail?
Audit Trail is a tool that holds a record of events and changes performed within a Scaleway Organization.

### Why do I need Audit Trail?
Audit Trail helps you ensure accountability and security by recording who did what and when within your Scaleway Organization. It tracks activity across all your resources (identity of the principal, date of activity, source IP address, API method used, and status of the request).

You can use Audit Trail for troubleshooting, compliance verification, and analysis in the event of a breach.

## Specifications

### Where are my Audit Trail events stored?
Audit Trail events are stored in the same region where the activity occurred. This means that if an event takes place in a specific region, it will be saved and accessible in that same region.

Events from global products which are not region-specific such as [IAM](/iam/), are stored in the Paris region.
