A webhook is an automated message sent in real-time from one system to another when a specific event happens, the message is typically conveyed using HTTP requests that are sent to an endpoint of your choice.

They can be used to track and respond to email-related events such as deliveries, bounces and spam. You can also trigger automated processes or alerts based on specific email events and sync your email events with CRM systems, analytics platforms, or other services.

You can set up webhooks for Scaleway Transactional Email and subscribe them to [Scaleway Messaging and Queueing SNS Topics](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-topics/) to have real-time event alerts sent to your endpoints in the Scaleway console.

<Message type="note">
  Currently, webhooks are integrated exclusively with the Scaleway Messaging and Queuing SNS. Billing for webhooks is based on the Scaleway [SNS billing](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/managed-databases/#messaging-and-queuing).
