Scaleway Domains and DNS provides a managed DNS solution by providing default name servers for each domain name. If you want to use your own DNS servers, you can edit the name servers associated with your domain name.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have a domain name registered with Scaleway Domains and DNS

</Message>

1. Click **Domains and DNS** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Domains and DNS dashboard displays.
2. Click the domain name you want to configure.
3. Click **Edit** in the **Name Servers** section of the domain overview page.
4. Edit the name server information. For each name server of your domain you can provide:
    * A fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
    * An IPv6 address
    * An IPv4 address
    <Message type="tip">
      IP addresses are only required if you want to create **glue records**. A glue record provides the IP address of a name server so that DNS can resolve the domain name if the domain uses name servers hosted under that same domain name.
    </Message>
5. Click **Add name server** to add additional name servers and enter your server's information.
    <Message type="tip">
      We recommend you configure a minimum of two and a maximum of seven DNS servers for each domain name.
    </Message>
6. Click <Icon name="delete" /> to remove a name server.
7. Click <Icon name="validate" /> to validate your configuration. 
8. Click <Icon name="cancel" /> to cancel all changes you have made.
