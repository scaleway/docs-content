## Hyper-V - Overview

[Microsoft Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/hyper-v-on-windows-server) is a hypervizor which allows to create virtual machines on x86-64 systems.  
It is available since the release of Windows Server 2012.

A free stand-alone, but command-line only, version of Hyper-V Server is also available.

- You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net)
- You have a [Scaleway Dedibox](http://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox) server
- You have at least one [failover IP](/dedibox-network/ip-failover/concepts#failover-ips) with a [virtual MAC address](/dedibox-network/ip-failover/concepts#virtual-mac-address)
- Your Scaleway Dedibox server fufills the hardware requirements of the [HyperV version](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/system-requirements-for-hyper-v-on-windows) used by you

## Installing HyperV

A Windows distribution can be installed on a Scaleway Dedibox server in two ways: through the [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net/en/login) or through [KVM over IP](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch#KVM_over_IP_(IPKVM)>).

### Via the Dedibox Console

When installing Windows automatically via the console, a monthly subscription to a license is required.

Scaleway Dedibox offers monthly subscriptions to different versions of Microsoft Windows Standard Server licenses, but to benefit from HyperV it is recommended to install the **2012 R2 English (64-bit)** version.

1. Access the server page of your Dedibox on the console and click **Install**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-click-on-install.png" width="600" alt="" />

2. Click **Server Distributions**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-distribution-options.png" width="600" alt="" />

3. Select **Windows** on the distribution menu, then **windows standard_2012_r2 64BITS** under **Chose a Version** and click **Install Windows**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-install-windows.png" width="600" alt="" />

4. Complete the next steps by including your **Partitioning** and **System Configuration** preferences when requested and conclude installation.

### Via KVM over IP

Your server can also be booted from a Windows Server ISO file through a KVM over IP device if included in your Dedibox. This type of installation gives you the possibility of installing your own licenses or remote ISO files.

You can download Windows and HyperV ISO images from Microsoftâ€™s [evaluation center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter).

1. To begin installation via KVM over IP, access the server page of your Dedibox on the console and click **Install**.

2. Click **on KVM over IP**.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-kvm-over-ip.png" width="600" alt="" />

3. A Disclaimer window pops up. Make sure you have read and agreed to the terms displayed and click **I ACCEPT**.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-disclaimer.png" width="300" alt="" />

4. You will be redirected to your server's status page. Click the third button on the right. The model of the KVM over IP device is determined by the brand of your Dedibox chassis. For a Dell chassis, you will use **IDRAC**.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-idrac.png" width="600" alt="" />

The process from this step forward may differ according to the KVM model being used. Please refer to the technical documentation of your machine to conclude the installation.

### HyperV on Windows

1. Once the installation is complete, connect to your server using the [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol) and launch the Application **Hyper-V Manager** from the **Windows Administrative Tools** section of the start menu:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-hyperv_manager.png" width="250" alt="" />

  <Message type="note">

    In case you can not find the **Hyper-V Manager** application on your machine, the Hyper-V role might not be installed. You can [install the role](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/get-started/install-the-hyper-v-role-on-windows-server) from the Windows Server Manager.

## Deploying a Virtual Machine

1. From the Hyper-V Manager application click **New** in the **Actions** menu, then **Virtual Machine** to launch the virtual machine creation wizard:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-hyperv_01.png" width="800" alt="" />

2. The VM creation wizard displays. Click **Next** to begin with the configuration of the new virtual machine:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-hyperv_02.png" width="600" alt="" />

3. Choose a name and a location for the virtual machine. If no specific configuration is required from your side, leave the default value:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-hyperv_03.png" width="600" alt="" />

4. Choose the generation of the virtual machine. You can either use the older **Generation 1** for compatiblity avec older versions of Hyper-V or the newer **Generation 2**. For more information about the different generations, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/plan/should-i-create-a-generation-1-or-2-virtual-machine-in-hyper-v).

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-hyperv_04.png" width="600" alt="" />

5. Assign memory to the virtual machine. You can either define a static value or enable dynamic memory allocation, depending on your workloads:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-hyperv_05.png" width="600" alt="" />

6. Choose the network for the virtual machine. If your Dedibox has more than one network interface, choose the public Internet facing network adapter from the drop-down list:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-hyperv_06.png" width="600" alt="" />

7. Connect the virtual hard disk to the virtual machine. Either create a new virtual disk, or choose an existing disk to restore a machine from a previous backup. By default all virtual disks are stored in the directory `C:\Users\Public\Documents\Hyper-V\Virtual Hard Disks\`. Choose the disk size for the virtual machine towards your requirements:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-hyperv_07.png" width="600" alt="" />

8. Choose the installation options for the virtual machine. You can either specify to create the machine without operating system, specify a local ISO file or provide information for a network based installation server. If you have downloaded an ISO file to install your OS, choose the second option and specify the file path before clicking **Next**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-hyperv_08.png" width="600" alt="" />

9. A configuration summary displays. Click **Finish** to launch the creation of the virtual machine:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-hyperv_09.png" width="600" alt="" />

10. To make sure that the virtual machine is allowed to communicate on the Internet, a virtual MAC address has to be assigned to the failover IP from the [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net/). Refer to the [dedicated documentation](ADD LINK HERE) for more information how to create a virtual MAC address. Click **Settings** in the VM section of the menu.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-hyperv_10.png" width="800" alt="" />

11. Click **Network Adapter** (1), **Advanced Features** (2), then on **Static** in the **MAC Address** section. Enter the virtual MAC address of the failover IP in the form and validate by clicking on **Apply**, then **OK** to leave the settings window.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-hyperv_11.png" width="800" alt="" />

12. Start the Virtual Machine by clicking on **Start** in the side menu. The virtual machine will boot from the ISO file and the installtion wizard of the operating system displays. Follow the steps of the wizard to complete the installation.

13. Once the installation of the guest OS has completed, configure the virtual networking as described in our [documentation](/compute/bare-metal-cloud/how-to/configure-flexible-ip/). Once configured, you may run a ping test to check the connectivity of the virtual machine:
