## Asymmetric encryption

Asymmetric encryption is a fundamental type of cryptographic method used to secure data with a pair of keys: a **public key** and a **private key**.

The public key is used for encryption and can be shared openly, while the private key is used for decryption and must be kept secret. This design eliminates the need to share a single key securely, which is a challenge in symmetric encryption.

Asymmetric encryption is particularly well-suited for secure communication and authentication, such as encrypting emails or verifying digital signatures. However, it is slower than symmetric encryption. Algorithms like RSA and ECC are common examples of asymmetric encryption.

As of now, Key Manager supports the following asymmetric encryption algorithms:

- RSA-OAEP-2048-SHA256: RSA encryption with 2048-bit key and OAEP padding using SHA-256.
- RSA-OAEP-3072-SHA256: RSA encryption with 3072-bit key and OAEP padding using SHA-256. (recommended)
- RSA-OAEP-4096-SHA256: RSA encryption with 4096-bit key and OAEP padding using SHA-256.

## Ciphertext

Ciphertext refers to data that has been encrypted using a cryptographic algorithm and a key.

Unlike [plaintext](#plaintext), ciphertext is not human-readable and cannot be understood or used without first decrypting it with the appropriate decryption key.

Ciphertext can be encrypted on the client side as long as the encryption key used for encryption is safely stored (in a Key Manager, for example).


## Cryptographic operation

A cryptographic operation is any action performed using cryptography to secure data, ensure privacy, or authenticate information.

Key Manager supports the five following cryptographic operations:

- [Encryption](#encryption)
- [Decryption](#decryption)
- [Data encryption key](#data-encryption-key-dek) generation
- [Signature](#signature)
- [Signature verification](#signature-verification)

These operations are designed to protect data from unauthorized access, ensure its integrity, and verify the identities of users or systems.

Refer to the [Understanding Key Manager cryptography](/key-manager/reference-content/cryptographic-details-key-manager/) documentation page for more information.

## Data encryption key (DEK)

A data encryption key is a type of key that can be used outside Key Manager to encrypt and decrypt [payloads](#payload).

Key Manager generates DEKs on-demand. They are then encrypted by a [key encryption key](#key-encryption-key-kek) specified by the user, and forwarded to the recipient.

DEKs are **not stored in or managed by Key Manager**. Users are responsible for safely storing and managing DEKs. DEKs should have the same lifecycle as the [payload](#payload) they encrypt.

## Decryption

A cryptographic operation used to convert [ciphertext](#ciphertext) back into its original [plaintext](#plaintext) form, using a key encryption key.

The only way to decrypt an encrypted payload is by using the `Decrypt` [endpoint](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/key-manager/#path-keys-decrypt-an-encrypted-payload). Since key versions never leave Key Manager, there is no other way to decrypt data outside Key Manager.  A payload encrypted with an older key version can still be decrypted. In this case, for convenience, the payload encrypted with the latest key version will be returned, along with the decrypted payload.

## Encryption

A cryptographic operation used to encrypt data using the latest version of the Key Manager key. The [encryption algorithm](#encryption-algorithm) used is the one defined when setting the [key usage](#key-usage).

The input data is arbitrary, but this endpoint should only be used to encrypt **data encryption keys**, not actual [payloads](#payload).

## Encryption algorithm

An encryption algorithm is the specific procedure used to perform encryption and decryption.

It defines the exact steps to transform plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa using a key.

As of now, Key Manager supports the following **symmetric** encryption algorithm:

- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): A widely used symmetric encryption algorithm.

It also supports the following **asymmetric** encryption algorithms:

- RSA-OAEP-2048-SHA256: RSA encryption with 2048-bit key and OAEP padding using SHA-256.
- RSA-OAEP-3072-SHA256: RSA encryption with 3072-bit key and OAEP padding using SHA-256. (recommended)
- RSA-OAEP-4096-SHA256: RSA encryption with 4096-bit key and OAEP padding using SHA-256.

Refer to the [Understanding Key Manager cryptography](/key-manager/reference-content/cryptographic-details-key-manager/) documentation page for more information.

## Encryption method

An encryption method is a broader approach used to convert readable data ([plaintext](#plaintext)) into an unreadable format ([ciphertext](#ciphertext)) which may involve one or more [encryption algorithms](#encryption-algorithm).

There are three types of encryption methods:

- [Symmetric encryption](#symmetric-encryption)
- [Asymmetric encryption](#asymmetric-encryption)
- Hybrid encryption: An encryption method that combines both symmetric and asymmetric methods

Key Manager supports symmetric and asymmetric encryption. Refer to the [Understanding Key Manager cryptography](/key-manager/reference-content/cryptographic-details-key-manager/) documentation page for more information.

## Encryption scheme

An encryption scheme is a structured approach to encryption that specifies the encryption algorithm, key size, and mode of operation for block ciphers.

For example, in the `AES-256-GCM` encryption scheme:

- `AES` refers to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption algorithm
- `256` refers to the key length in bits
- `GCM` or Galois/Counter Mode, is the mode of operation for block ciphers. GCM encrypts your plaintext data using AES, and authenticates it using a unique "tag". This means that if anyone tampers with your data, you will know because the tag will not match anymore.

## Key encryption key (KEK)

A key encryption key (KEK) is a type of key that has a single purpose: encrypting and decrypting [data encryption keys](#data-encryption-key-dek).

The KEK is permanently stored in Scaleway's Key Manager and never leaves it. It cannot be accessed by anyone and should be [rotated](/key-manager/api-cli/rotate-keys-api-cli/) regularly.

## Key management

Key management is the process of handling keys used in cryptographic systems to ensure the security and integrity of your cryptographic operations. This includes the generation, exchange, storage, usage, and disposal of these keys.
Although strong cipher algorithms allow you to protect your information with secret keys, your data is only protected as long as your encryption keys are kept secret from unauthorized individuals.

## Key protection

Key protection allows your key to be used and modified, but not deleted. This provides an additional layer of security.

## Key rotation

Key rotation is the process of replacing an old cryptographic key with a new one. It is a critical practice in key management to minimize the risk of exposure if a key is compromised and to enhance the overall security and resilience of your systems.

When using [symmetric encryption](#symmetric-encryption), it is generally recommended to rotate keys every 30 to 90 days.

After rotating your Key Manager keys, all cryptographic operations will use the new rotated keys. All data encrypted with former key versions will remain decipherable with the former key.

Key rotation is only available for symmetric keys. Refer to the [How to rotate Key Manager keys](/key-manager/api-cli/rotate-keys-api-cli/) documentation page for more information.

## Key usage

The key usage specifies the **algorithm** used to create subsequent key versions, and the **scope of cryptographic operations** supported by your key encryption key.
You must define a key usage upon key creation. Key Manager supports symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption and asymmetric signing.

## Key version

A key version is a specific iteration of your key encryption key. Each version of your key represents a distinct state or version that may be [rotated](#key-rotation) or replaced over time.

Key versions allow you to manage and track changes to your data encryption keys. When using key versions, all cryptographic operations will rely on the current key version.

Data you have encrypted with previous key versions will still be accessible and decipherable using those specific keys, ensuring backward compatibility.

## Payload

A payload refers to the core data or message being transmitted, processed, or protected. It is the information of interest that encryption or other security mechanisms aim to secure.

## Plaintext

Plaintext refers to unencrypted, readable data. In the context of key management, plaintext often refers to cryptographic keys or sensitive data that are stored or transmitted in an unencrypted form. This term is often used in contrast to ciphertext, which is data that has been encrypted and is not readable without decryption.

## Region

A region refers to the **geographical location** in which your key will be created. **Each region contains multiple Availability Zones**. Your key will be duplicated on **all Availability Zones** of the selected region. Scaleway is available in the Paris, Amsterdam, and Warsaw regions.

## Root encryption key (REK)

A root encryption key (REK) is another type of key that has the single purpose of encrypting and decrypting KEKs in order to store them in hard storage. Scaleway's Key Manager has one REK per region, which is securely stored in our facilities.

## Signature

Signature is a cryptographic technique used to ensure the authenticity and integrity of data. In this process, a digest (hash) of the message is created and then signed using a private key. This signature can later be verified by anyone with access to the corresponding public key.

Signatures are widely used in scenarios like document signing, secure communication, and identity verification. They offer assurance that the data originated from a trusted source and has not been tampered with.

As of now, Key Manager supports the following asymmetric signing algorithms:

- EC-P256-SHA256: ECDSA signing with the P-256 curve and SHA-256. (recommended)
- EC-P384-SHA256: ECDSA signing with the P-384 curve and SHA-384.
- RSA-PSS-2048-SHA256: RSA-PSS signing with 2048-bit key and SHA-256.
- RSA-PSS-3072-SHA256: RSA-PSS signing with 3072-bit key and SHA-256.
- RSA-PSS-4096-SHA256: RSA-PSS signing with 4096-bit key and SHA-256.
- RSA-PKCS1-2048-SHA256: RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signing with 2048-bit key and SHA-256.
- RSA-PKCS1-3072-SHA256: RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signing with 3072-bit key and SHA-256.
- RSA-PKCS1-4096-SHA256: RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signing with 4096-bit key and SHA-256.

## Signature verification

Signature verification is the process of confirming the authenticity and integrity of a digital signature.
It involves using the public key corresponding to the private key that was used to create the signature to verify that the data has not been altered and that it comes from the claimed sender.
This process is crucial for ensuring secure and reliable communication.

## Scheduled deletion

When you delete a key, it is scheduled for deletion. This lets you mark a key and its version for deletion ahead of time. Instead of immediate deletion, the key enters a 7-day pending deletion period, during which you can still recover it.

During this time, you can read your key version but cannot edit, access, or delete it. After the retention period, the key and its version are permanently deleted.


## Symmetric encryption

Symmetric encryption is a fundamental type of cryptographic method where the same key is used to both encrypt and decrypt data. This means that the sender and receiver must have access to the same secret key, which they use to secure their communication.

Because symmetric encryption relies on a single key, it is generally fast and ideal for encrypting large volumes of data. However, its security depends entirely on keeping the key confidential.

Symmetric encryption algorithms like AES are widely used in scenarios where speed and efficiency are critical. As of now, Key Manager only supports the `AES_256_GCM` symmetric encryption algorithm.
