Scaleway supports Identity Federation to provide your teams with secure access to their accounts via SAML Single Sign-On.

<Message type="note">
  SSO with SAML does not apply to an Organization's Owner. Owners can log in with SSO with OAuth2.
</Message>

Follow the steps below to set up Identity Federation for your Organization through SAML at Scaleway.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Authentik instance and user allowing you to perform admin actions.

<Message type="important">
  - In order to log in via SAML, members need to be [created manually](/iam/how-to/manage-members/#how-to-create-a-member) in your Scaleway organization.
  - If you delete a user in the IdP, the corresponding Member is not automatically deleted in your Scaleway Organization. The [deletion must happen manually](/iam/how-to/manage-members/#how-to-delete-a-member).
