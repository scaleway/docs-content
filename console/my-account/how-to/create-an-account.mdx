Scaleway is a complete cloud ecosystem, offering a single way for you to create, deploy and scale your infrastructure in the cloud. Create your Scaleway account to gain access to the [Scaleway Console](/console/my-account/concepts/#console) and [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/), and deploy our products and services with ease.

1. Open the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) in a web browser and click **Create one now and join the Scaleway community.** to create a Scaleway account.
2. Choose whether you want to create a **personal** or **professional** account.
3. Enter your account details, as well as your email address in the form. Tick the checkbox to receive periodic marketing communications from Scaleway (optional). If asked, confirm that you are not a robot by ticking the checkbox. Then click **Create account**.
    <Message type="note">
      If you are a startup, you can create a corporate account and check **Yes** under **Are you a startup?**. This allows you to benefit from offers dedicated to startups.
    </Message>
4. A verification mail has been send to your email address. Check your mailbox and click the verification link in your mailbox to confirm your email address and agree to our terms of service. Click **Go to Scaleway console** to proceed.
5. [Add your billing information](/console/my-account/how-to/manage-billing-information/#how-to-add-a-payment-method) and payment method. This will give you access to Scaleway resources.<br />
    Alternatively, click **Add later** to browse around the Scaleway console without the possibility to order services. To add your billing information later, click **Add information** on the console main page.
