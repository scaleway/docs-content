[Scaleway Container Registry](/compute/container-registry/concepts#container-registry) is a fully-managed mutualised container registry, designed to facilitate the storage, management and deployment of container images. The service simplifies the development-to-production workflow, as there is no need to operate your own Container Registry or to worry about the underlying infrastructure. 

Within your Container Registry, [namespaces](/compute/container-registry/concepts#namespace) allow you to manage your registry in a clear, simple and human-readable way. A namespace is a collection of container images, each bearing the unique identifier of that namespace. To start using your Container Registry, you first need to create a namespace.

    * The **Name** for the namespace
    * A **Description** of the namespace 
    * The geographical **Region** of the namespace
    * The namespace's **Privacy Policies**

    <Message type="note">

    A namespace can either be [public or private](/compute/container-registry/concepts#namespace-privacy-policies). Anyone will be able to pull container images from a public namespace. Privacy policies may be set at image level.
