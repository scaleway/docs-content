You can view metrics for Topics and Events via [Scaleway Cockpit](/cockpit/quickstart/). This allows you to monitor your topics and messages at a glance. There are two steps to complete to view your metrics for the first time with Cockpit:

1. Generate your Grafana credentials
2. Access the product's metrics dashboard

These steps are described below.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to generate Grafana credentials

To view your metrics with Cockpit, you will use a Grafana dashboard which is accessible from the Scaleway console. First, you must create a user and their associated credentials (a username and password) for Grafana. This can be done directly from the Scaleway console, [by following this procedure](/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/).

## How to access your Topics and Events dashboard and view your metrics

1. Click **Topics and Events** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu.

2. Click the **Metrics** tab.

3. Click **Open Grafana metrics dashboard**.

4. Enter your Grafana username and password to log in.

    You are directed to the Topics and Events dashboard, where you can view all your metrics.
