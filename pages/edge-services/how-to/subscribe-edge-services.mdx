Edge Services is an additional feature for Scaleway Load Balancers and Object Storage buckets. It provides:
- A [caching service](/edge-services/how-to/configure-cache/) to improve performance by reducing load on your [origin](#origin)
- A [Web Application Firewall (WAF)](/edge-services/how-to/configure-waf/) to protect your origin from threats and malicious activity
- A customizable and secure [endpoint](#endpoint) for accessing content via Edge Services, which can be set to a subdomain of your choice

To use Edge Services, you must subscribe to a [pricing plan](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/network/#edge-services). Within its monthly price, each pricing plan includes:

- A fixed number of Edge Services [pipelines](/edge-services/concepts/#pipeline). You can create pipelines for either Load Balancers, Object Storage buckets, or a mixture of both, with your subscription plan.
- A certain amount of egress cache data (the quantity of data transferred from Edge Services' caches, not including the transfer from the origin bucket or Load Balancer).
- A certain amount of WAF requests (the number of requests that can be filtered through WAF across all your pipelines)

<Message type="note">
Note that the Starter plan does not include any WAF requests. Nonetheless, you can purchase an add-on that gives you a certain amount of requests for a fixed monthly price. The option to purchase the add-on will be displayed when you enable WAF on a pipeline.
</Message>

If you create more pipelines than are included in your plan, or your pipelines' caches egress more data than is included, or you make more WAF requests than are included, you will be charged additionally for this. The rates per pipeline/GB of data are indicated on the [pricing](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/network/#edge-services) page.

Subscriptions are pro rata, meaning you can cancel your subscription or change your plan at any time, and you will be charged proportionally.

## How to subscribe to Edge Services

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

<Message type="tip">
You can subscribe to Edge Services from the Object Storage or Load Balancer dashboards of the Scaleway console. However, the instructions below detail how to subscribe from the dedicated Edge Services section of the console. <br/><br/>Whichever path you use, the same pricing plans and subscription mechanisms apply. Subscribing from the Object Storage or Load Balancer dashboards does **not** limit you to only creating pipelines for that product with your subscription. Subscription plans are scoped to a single Scaleway [Project](/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project).

2. Click **Subscribe to Edge Services**.

    Information about available [pricing plans](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/network/#edge-services) is displayed. All pricing plans have a fixed monthly price, and include a certain number of pipelines, a certain amount of cache data (data egressed from all your Edge Services pipelines' caches), and a certain amount of WAF requests (across all pipelines). Any extra pipelines, cache egress or WAF requests are charged at the additional rates shown.

    Your subscription is created, and you are returned to the Edge Services dashboard, on the **Pipelines** tab. All your Edge Services pipelines will display here.

    On the **Plans** tab you can view your current subscription plan, and your Edge Services consumption in relation to your plan's limits on pipelines, cache and WAF.

## How to change your subscription plan

You can change your Edge Services subscription plan at any time. Subscriptions are pro rata: the monthly price will be applied based on the proportion of the month you are subscribed to the plan. 

If you upgrade your plan, any additional charges (for extra pipelines, cache data or WAF requests) that you had already accumulated before the time of upgrade will still stand.
