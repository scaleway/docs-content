This documentation concerns rescue mode for [Bare Metal Cloud Servers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/bare-metal-servers/). To use rescue mode on [Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/) refer to the corresponding [documentation](/compute/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes#how-to-use-rescue-mode).

</Message>

Rescue mode allows you to boot a [Bare Metal Cloud Server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/bare-metal-servers/) from the network. It downloads a rescue operating system, based on [Ubuntu Linux](https://ubuntu.com/), that runs completely in the RAM of the server. This allows you to perform maintenance and data recovery operations, even if the machine is not reachable in normal mode.

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)  
- You have [configured your SSH Key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key)
- You have [created](/compute/bare-metal-cloud/how-to/create-server) and [installed](/compute/bare-metal-cloud/how-to/install-server) a Bare Metal server

1. Click **Bare Metal** in the **Compute** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Bare Metal dashboard displays.

2. Choose the server you want to reboot into rescue mode from the list. Click its name to display that server's information page.

3. Scroll down to the **Rescue Mode** section.

  The server starts to reboot into rescue mode.

  Depending on the hardware model of the machine, the reboot may take several minutes.

5. Once rebooted, use a terminal application to log into the machine using SSH with the user account `root`:

  ```
  ssh root@<bare-metal-cloud-server>
  ```

You are now logged into rescue mode and able to perform maintenance actions on the machine. The rescue mode is based on Ubuntu [Bionic Beaver (18.04)](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BionicBeaver/ReleaseNotes) and you can run commands as on any Ubuntu Linux machine.

<Message type="tip">

Rescue mode runs completely in the RAM of the server. To access files located on the hard disk, it needs to be mounted. The disk can be mounted automatically by running `mountall.sh`

</Message>


## How to reboot into normal mode

Once the maintenance of the machine is completed, it can be rebooted back into the operating system installed on the hard disk of the server.

To reboot the server into normal mode, click the **Rescue on** button in the rescue mode section of the server's details. The server reboots on the installed system and will be available in normal mode within a few minutes.
