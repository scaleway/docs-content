Plausible Analytics is an open-source web analytics project wirth the mission to make analytics more privacy-friendly. It is possible to self-host the solution on Scaleway Instances and to reduce the dependency and surveillance of other tools coming from the AdTech world.
The tool helps to improve your sites performances with the analytics script weighing less then 1KB - that is 45 times smaller than the site tag of a commercial analytics solution. Plausible Analytics is designed to be self-hosted through Docker.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your SSH Key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
  - You have [created an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) that runs Ubuntu Jammy Jellyfish (22.04 LTS)
</Message>

1. Log into your Instance using SSH:
    ```
    ssh root@<your_scaleway_instance_ip>
    ```
2. Update the `apt` package manager and upgrate the software already installed on your Instance to the latest available version.
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
3. Install the Docker GPG Key. This step is required to verify the validity of the Docker packages that you will install in a later step.
    ```
    sudo mkdir -m 0755 -p /etc/apt/keyrings
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
    ```
4. Configure Docker's software repositories to be able to install the required software on your Instance.
    ```
    echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
    $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
    ```
5. Update the packet manager, and install Docker and its dependencies using `apt`. 
    ```
    apt update && apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli docker-compose containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
    ```
6. Download and unpack the Plausible repository:
    ```
    curl -L https://github.com/plausible/hosting/archive/master.tar.gz | tar -xz
    ```
    <Message type="tip">
      If you have `git` installed on your machine, you can also clone the repository using the following command:
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/plausible/hosting
      ```
    </Message>
7. Enter the Plausible directory:
    ```
    cd hosting*
    ```
    Two important files are located in the downloaded folder:
    `docker-compose.yml` - installs and orchestrates networking between your Plausible server, Postgres database, Clickhouse database (for stats), and an SMTP server. This file comes preconfigured with values for most setups. You can tweak it if required. 
    `plausible-conf.env` - configures the Plausible server itself. The full list of configuration options is avialable in the [official documentation](https://plausible.io/docs/self-hosting-configuration).
8. Generate a random 64-character secret key which will be used to secure the application. Run the following command to generate one and copy it into your computers clipboard.
    ```
    openssl rand -base64 64 | tr -d '\n' ; echo
    ```
9. Open the file in a text editor (e.g. `nano`) and set the `SECRET_KEY_BASE` to the key you have generated in the previous step. Then set the `BASE_URL` for your Instance. Optionally include a port, if no port is configured it will use the default port `8000`.
    ```
    nano plausible-conf.env
    ```
10. Start the server
    ```
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
