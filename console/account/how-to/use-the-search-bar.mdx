The **search bar** functionality within the Scaleway console allows you to quickly find your Scaleway resources.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)

1. Log into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).
2. Navigate to the search bar located next to the Organization dashboard menu.
    <Message type="tip">
      You can also access the search bar by typing `Cmd + K` on macOS and `Ctrl + K` on Linux or Windows.
    </Message>
3. Click in the search bar and enter the keyword you are looking for. The keyword can be the name or the IP of a resource.
    <Message type="note">
    As this is an early version (v2) of the search bar, results are limited. This version of the search bar may not yet include all resources and a "no result" message may appear despite the existence of the resource.
