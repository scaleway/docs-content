## VirtualBox Overview

VirtualBox is a free and open-source hypervisor for x86 virtualization. It is developed by Oracle Corporation and the base package is released under the [GNU General Public License V2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html).

[Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is an alternative to other hypervisors like [Proxmox](/tutorials/proxmox-softraid/) or [VMware ESXi](/tutorials/configure-virtual-machine-esxi/).

<Message type="requirement">

- You have a [Scaleway Dedibox dedicated server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/).
- The server should be running a fresh installation of Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS).
- You have at least one [failover IP](/dedibox-network/ip-failover/concepts/#failover-ips)
- You have a (sub-)domain pointed to your server.

</Message>

## Installing the VirtualBox Hypervisor

1. Log into your server using SSH.

  ```
  ssh user@<server_ip>
  ```

2. Switch to the `root` account using `sudo`, in case you are connected as a regular user.

  ```
  sudo su
  ```

3. Update the `apt` package cache and upgrade the software already installed on the machine to the latest version available in the repositories.

  ```
  apt update && apt upgrade -y
  ```

4. Install the following prerequisites using `apt`:

  ```
  apt install build-essential dkms unzip wget -y
  ```

5. Download and install the VirtualBox public key.

  ```
  wget -q https://www.virtualbox.org/download/oracle_vbox_2016.asc -O- | apt-key add -
  ```

6. Create a configuration file for the VirtualBox repository.

  ```
  sh -c "echo 'deb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian jammy contrib' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/virtualbox.list"
  ```

7. Update `apt`.

  ```
  apt update
  ```

8. Install VirtualBox Version 6.1 using the `apt` package manager:

  ```
  apt install virtualbox-6.1
  ```

9. Check if the Virtualbox service is running.

  ```
  systemctl status vboxdrv
  ```

  The output should look like the following example:

  ```
  ‚óè vboxdrv.service - VirtualBox Linux kernel module
    Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/virtualbox/vboxdrv.sh; enabled; vendor preset: enabl
    Active: active (exited) since Thu 2020-04-16 17:28:25 CEST; 10s ago
      Tasks: 0 (limit: 4915)
    CGroup: /system.slice/vboxdrv.service
  ```

## Creating a VirtualBox User

1. Create a new user for VirtualBox. It is named `vbox` in the following example, but you can use a name of your choice:

  ```
  adduser vbox
  ```

2. Add the user to the group `vboxusers`.

  ```
  usermod -aG vboxusers vbox
  ```

## Installing the VirtualBox Extension Pack

The VirtualBox expansion pack provides support for USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 devices, VirtualBox RDP, disk encryption, NVMe and PXE boot for Intel cards.

<Message type="note">

The Extension Pack binaries are released under the [VirtualBox Personal Use and Evaluation License (PUEL)](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox_PUEL).

</Message>

1. Download the expansion pack using `wget`:

  ```
  wget https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.2.42/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-5.2.42.vbox-extpack
  ```

2. Install the expansion pack by running the following command:

  ```
  VBoxManage extpack install Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-5.2.40.vbox-extpack
  ```

## Installing phpVirtualBox

[phpVirtualBox](https://github.com/phpvirtualbox/phpvirtualbox/) is an open-source web application written in PHP, allowing you to manage virtual machines from an easy to use web interface.

1. Install the Apache web server and PHP using `apt`.

  ```
  apt install apache2 php php-mysql libapache2-mod-php php-soap php-xml -y
  ```

2. Download the application from its GitHub repository.

  ```
  wget https://github.com/phpvirtualbox/phpvirtualbox/archive/5.2-1.zip
  ```

3. Unzip the downloaded file.

  ```
  unzip 5.2-1.zip
  ```

4. Move the downloaded folder to its final destination `/var/www/html/phpvirtualbox`.

  ```
  mv phpvirtualbox-5.2-1/ /var/www/html/phpvirtualbox
  ```

5. The application provides an example configuration file, copy its content into an actual configuration file that will be used.

  ```
  cp /var/www/html/phpvirtualbox/config.php-example /var/www/html/phpvirtualbox/config.php
  ```

6. Open the configuration file in a text editor, for example `nano`.

  ```
  nano /var/www/html/phpvirtualbox/config.php
  ```

7. Replace the following values with the system user (for example `vbox`) and its associated password, configured in a previous step. Set the value for `$vrdeaddress` and `$consoleHost` to the public IP of your dedicated server to be able to connect to the remote console of your virtual machines.

  ```
  /* Username / Password for system user that runs VirtualBox */
  var $username = 'vbox';
  var $password = '<a_secret_password>';

  [...]
  /* Set the default VRDE address, e.g. 192.168.1.1 */
  var $vrdeaddress = '<your_servers_ip>';
  var $consoleHost = '<your_servers_ip>';
  ```

  Save the file and exit the text editor.

8. Open the VirtualBox init script in a text editor, for example `nano`.

  ```
  nano /etc/default/virtualbox
  ```

9. Add a new line at the end of the file. Remember to replace `vbox` with the name of your user, if different.

  ```
  VBOXWEB_USER=vbox
  ```

10. Restart the `vboxweb-service`.

  ```
  systemctl restart vboxweb-service
  ```

11. Restart `vboxdrv`.

  ```
  systemctl restart vboxdrv
  ```

## Securing the Hypervisor

### Adding TLS Encryption to the Apache Web Server

To secure the connection between the web browser and the Apache web server HTTPS should be configured. A TLS certificate can be obtained and managed for free from the [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate authority by using the [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) application.

1. Install the pre-required packages and repositories.

  ```
  apt install software-properties-common -y && add-apt-repository universe -y && add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot -y
  ```

2. Update the `apt` package cache.

  ```
  apt update
  ```

3. Install Certbot via `apt`.

  ```
  apt install certbot python-certbot-apache -y
  ```

4. Create a configuration file for phpVirtualBox, by making a copy of the default configuration.

  ```
  cp /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/phpvirtualbox.example.com.conf
  ```

5. Open the file in a text editor:

  ```
  nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/phpvirtualbox.example.com.conf
  ```

6. Edit the following lines to match your configuration, add them to the file, save it and exit the editor:

  ```
  ServerAdmin webmaster@example.com
  ServerName phpvirtualbox.example.com
  DocumentRoot /var/www/html/phpvirtualbox/
  ```

7. Activate the new site:

  ```
  a2ensite phpvirtualbox.example.com
  ```

8. Reload the Apache configuration to enable the new site.

  ```
  systemctl reload apache2
  ```

9. Run Certbot to request a certificate.

  ```
  certbot --apache
  ```

  Certbot will ask you a couple of questions:

    - In a first step Certbot asks for your email address. Enter it and press `Enter` on your keyboard.
    - You will then be asked to agree to the terms of service, confirm it by pressing on `A`.
    - Decide if you want to share your email address with the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). Press `Y` for yes or `N` for no.
    - Following you will be asked for which domains you want to activate SSL. Select the appropriate numbers separated by commas and/or spaces, or leave input blank to select all options shown.
    - Certbot asks if all traffic should be forced to HTTPS. Type `1` for no or `2` for yes.

  The certificate is being requested and the following message appears once it has been obtained:

  ```
  Congratulations! You have successfully enabled https://phpvirtualbox.example.com

  You should test your configuration at:
  https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=phpvirtualbox.example.com
  ```

### Configuring a Firewall

A firewall controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. To protect your server from potential attacks or security issues, install [UFW (or Uncomplicated FireWall)](/tutorials/installation-uncomplicated-firewall/), a frontend for IPTables to simplify the configuration.

1. Install `ufw` using the `apt` package manager.

  ```
  apt install ufw
  ```

2. Configure a rule that denies everything by default.

  ```
  ufw default deny
  ```

3. Enable outgoing traffic.

  ```
  ufw default allow outgoing
  ```

4. Authorize SSH connections.

  ```
  ufw allow 22/tcp
  ```

5. Authorize HTTPS connections.

  ```
  ufw allow 443/tcp
  ```

6. Allow connections to the RDP port-range used for the serial console of the VM's running on the hypervisor.

  ```
  ufw allow 9000:9100/tcp
  ```

7. Apply the firewall rules.

  ```
  ufw enable
  ```

8. Confirm the application of the firewall rules by pressing `Y` when prompted.

  ```
  Command may disrupt existing ssh connections. Proceed with operation (y|n)?
  ```

## Creating Virtual Machines using phpVirtualBox
