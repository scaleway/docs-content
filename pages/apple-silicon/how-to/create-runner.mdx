import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'


You can install your Mac mini with a pre-installed runner for GitHub or GitLab thanks to [Scaleway's Dev OS](/apple-silicon/reference-content/scaleway-dev-os/).

<Message type="important">
  If you wish to switch from **Runner** mode to [**Standard** mode](/apple-silicon/how-to/create-mac-mini/) (or vice versa), you must delete you current Mac mini and place a new order with the desired configuration. Mode changes cannot be performed in-place.
</Message>

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)

<Message type="important">
  Due to license constraints, the minimum lease for Apple silicon is 24 hours. As a result, the earliest you can delete a Mac mini is 24 hours after the start of its lease.

## Creating a runner

1. Click [Apple silicon](https://console.scaleway.com/asaas/servers) in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu. The [Apple silicon splash page](https://console.scaleway.com/asaas/servers) displays.
    <Message type="note">
    Should your account already contain Mac minis, a list of these will be displayed rather than the Apple silicon splash page.
    Alongside, you will see a (+ Create Mac mini) button, which you can click to create a new Mac mini.
    </Message>
2. Click **Create Mac mini**. The Mac mini creation wizard displays.
3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Choose the **Pre-installed runner** setup type for your Mac mini.
    - Choose an **Availability Zone**, which is the geographical region where your Mac mini will be deployed. The available Mac mini configurations depend on the Availability Zone:
    - Mac mini M4, M2 pro, and M2 are available in PARIS 1
    - Mac mini M1 are available in PARIS 3
    - Choose a [Dev OS](/apple-silicon/reference-content/scaleway-dev-os/) version.
    - Choose and configure your runner.
      - **GitHub**: Enter your repository URL, registration token, and a runner name.
      - **GitLab**: Enter your Instance URL, runner token, and a runner name.
        <Message type="tip">
            Credentials are validated during runner installation. If incorrect credentials are provided, the runner **will still be created but will be non-functional**. You will be able to [update your credentials](#updating-a-runner) post-installation.
        </Message>
    - Enter a **Name** for your Mac mini, or leave the randomly-generated name in place.
    - Verify the **Estimated cost** for your Mac mini based on your chosen specifications.
    - Select the commitment plan for your Mac mini. Two options are available:
      - **No commitment:** You can terminate the subscription of your Mac mini at any time after the initial 24 hours, a mandatory period required by Apple's software license. [Learn more about Apple's software license requirements (Section 3.A)](https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/macOSSequoia.pdf).
      - **Commitment:** You subscribe to a [commitment plan for Apple silicon](/apple-silicon/concepts/#commitment-plan) and benefit from a discounted monthly price based on your choice.
        <Message type="important">
            Currently, it is not possible to switch from a monthly commitment to hourly billing.
        </Message>
4. Tick the checkbox to agree to the Bare Metal specific conditions and the macOS License Agreement.
5. Click **Create Mac mini** to finish. The installation of your Apple silicon is launched, and you are informed when it is ready.

## Updating a runner

1. Click [Apple silicon](https://console.scaleway.com/asaas/servers) in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu. The Apple silicon splash page displays.
2. Select the machine you want to update. The runner information overview displays.
3. Open the **Settings** tab.
4. Click **Edit** in the **Runner information** section of the page. A pop-up displays.
5. Update your runner credentials and click **Save and reboot**. Your runner configuration will be updated and the runner performs a reboot to take the new configuration into effect.

## Reinstalling a runner

Reinstalling a server delivered in Dev OS mode is **not possible** due to the lengthy installation process required for the full Dev OS stack.
You have to delete the runner and [create a new one](#creating-a-runner).

## Deleting a runner

You can delete a runner like any Mac mini. Refer to [How to delete a Mac mini](/apple-silicon/how-to/delete-mac-mini) for further information.
