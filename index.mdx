## Navigating the Product Documentation Platform

The goal of this platform is to provide you with information about all the resources in the Scaleway Ecosystem and the procedures you should follow to get the best experience from our products and services. You will find **concepts**, **how-tos**, beginner and advanced **tutorials**, **API documentation** and **videos**.

To help you find content in the most effective way, Scaleway has organised its content into several types, each with its own focus.

| Content Type  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |
