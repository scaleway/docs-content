\* Lower limits may apply before account verification. Please contact our support team if you have any questions.

\** Total function memory is the sum of the memory allocated to all your functions at their maximum Scale.

These limits are enforced as [Account quotas](/console/my-account/reference-content/account-quotas/#serverless-functions).

If the limits are exceeded during the execution of the function, a restart occurs.

## Configuration Restrictions

In order to ensure the proper functioning of the product, we restrict the use of certain ports and environment variables.

* Blocked ports:
  * **25**: Due to potential abuse (spam), no outbound traffic is allowed through this port.
  * **465**: Due to potential abuse (spam), no outbound traffic is allowed through this port.
* Reserved environment variables:
  * `SCW_*`: Reserved for product configuration (for example: token validation)
