`.htaccess` is a simple text file containing commands for the configuration of the Apache webserver. It allows you to personalize the server dynamically and per folder.

<Message type="important">

- When you transfer your `.htaccess` file, make sure that the FTP transfer mode is set to "ASCII/TEXT" and not to "BINARY". If the file is transferred in binary mode you will get an http error 500. Your `.htaccess` must end with an empty line, if it is not the case you will get an error 500. This will block the access to your websites. Therefore, double check the syntax of the file before you are transferring it by FTP in text mode and not in binary mode.
- You can create the `.htaccess` file on Windows only using **Notepad**.

## How to configure personalized error messages? 

This function allows you to replace the message of a **404 error (Not found)** for a more friendly text or with a redirection to another URL, whether local or external.

1. Use the command `ErrorDocument` to configure personalized messages. Below are some examples of how to use it: 

  ```ErrorDocument 404 /myfile404.html
  ErrorDocument 404 http://www.URLexample.tld
  ErrorDocument 403 /accessrefused.html
  ```
2. Make sure this command is in an `.htaccess` file in the directory of which you wish to redirect the error messages. The directory is typically the root of your website but not necessarily.

## How to disable the listing of a directory? 

1. Create an `.htaccess` file by opening your text editor.
2. Create a text file containing the following line: 

  ```
  Options -Indexes
  ```

3. Upload your file using FTP, place it in the directory of your choice and rename it to `.htaccess`.


## How to prevent access to a directory? 

1. Open your text editor and create a text file containing the following line: 

  ```# We authorize to access from the IP 213.228.62.50
  Allow from 213.228.62.50
  # We authorize to access from the IP 213.228.62.51
  Allow from 213.228.62.51
  # We deny the access from all other IPs
  Deny from All
  ```
2. Upload your file using FTP, place it in the directory of your choice and rename it to `.htaccess`. 

## How to secure a directory with an HTTP authentication? 

1. Create a user table which is a list of the users and their passwords. Below is an example of what your user table should look like: 

    ```
    martin:$apr1$tQqqRlvz$70soamNFTNl54OnSV.RWr.
    jean:$apr1$yMWZ093W$DKAVAi5.XRx1ofwF5T..E0
    sophie:$apr1$92x5vRxN$vivxTZtZfcqRmRBvL1ASF/
    ```

   <Message type="note">

   - The first part is the user name, the second part after ":" is the encrypted password of the user.
   - If required, you may use this [website](https://hostingcanada.org/htpasswd-generator/) to encrypt your passwords.

   </Message>

2. Name this file **passlist.txt**.
3. Create an `.htaccess` file in the directory you want to protect to limit the access to the users specified in the file **passlist.txt**. The content of the file should be as following:

    ```AuthUserFile /PATH/passlist.txt
    AuthName "Acces Restricted"
    AuthType Basic
    require valid-user
    ```
   <Message type="important">

   - Replace `PATH` by: `/flex/domain/DOMAIN.TLD/site/www/`.
   - Replace `DOMAIN.TLD` with your domain name.
   - The command `AuthUserFile` specifies the path to the user table. The path is relative to `/` of your webhosting, therefore your path will generally start with at least `www/` or `blog/`.

   </Message>

4. If you have saved your user table in the directory `/www/secret/password/` with the name `mylist.txt` you need to change the `AuthUserFile` directive accordingly:

    ```
    AuthUserFile  /flex/domain/DOMAIN.TLD/site/www/secret/password/mylist.txt
    ```
   <Message type="note">

    - The command ```require valid-user``` authorizes all valid users to access the files in the folder. It is also possible to use ```require user martin sophie``` to only auhorize the users Martin and Sophie and to exclude Jean. 

   </Message>

5. Upload the file using FTP, place it in the directory of your choice and name it `.htaccess`. If you want to learn more about this, we recommend the [Apache user guide](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/) which treats all aspects of authentification in detail.

<Message type="important">

- It is not possible to create an `.htaccess` file directly on the Microsoft Windows platform. Therefore you need to create the file with another name, “htaccess.txt” for example on your computer and rename it after you have uploaded it to your server.
- You must transfer the file in the ASCII mode (refer to the documentation of your FTP client) to make sure that the 'line break' characters are preserved.
- It is highly recommended to protect its list of passwords, for example you can store it in a subdirectory of your website that you protect by creating an `.htaccess` file.

## How to configure HTTP redirections? 


1. Create an `.htaccess` file with the following content: 

  ```# Redirection to the site Scaleway.com
  RedirectPermanent / https://www.scaleway.com/en/
  ```

2. Upload the file using FTP in the folder of the concerned sub domain (folder `www` for www.URLexample, `blog` for blog.URLexample etc.) and name it `.htaccess`.

<Message type="tip">

- Take a look at the documentation on the [Apache website](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_alias.html) for more information.

## How to configure an HTML redirection

<Message type="note">

- This method is simpler but less efficient, it uses the HTML document itself to indicate the redirection. This method should only be used when HTTP redirects are impossible.

</Message>

Here is an example of the redirection of `http://old.address.fr/dossier1/URLexample/page1.html` to `http://new.address.fr/dossier2/URLexample/page2.html`: 

```<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=http://new.address.fr/dossier2/URLexample/page2.html" />
<title>Redirection</title>
<meta name="robots" content="noindex,follow" />
</head>
<body>
<p><a href="http://new.address.fr/dossier2/URLexample/page2.html">Redirection</a></p>
</body>
</html>
```

## How to configure PHP redirects


Create a PHP file containing the following content to redirect `http://URLexample/index.php/` directly to `http://newsite.com/`.

```<?php
header("Location: http://newsite.com/");
?>
```

<Message type="note">

- By default the redirection returns the code HTTP 301. Do not forget to modify it, if required.

</Message>

## How to rewrite Rules

<Message type="important">

- The Apache module `mod_rewrite` is activated on our webhosting servers and it works by default with `.htaccess` files.

- The directive `FollowSymlinks` is activated and must not be modified. Doing so will result in an HTTP 500 error.

</Message>


Let us do an example, the domain name is `URLexample`, the url we are going to call is `http://www.URLexample/index.php/` with the name of the page as argument

1. Create a htaccess file with the following content: 

  ``` 
  RewriteEngine On \\
  RewriteRule ^([^\.]+)\.html /index.php?page=$1 [L]
  ```
2. Upload the file using FTP in the folder of the concerned sub domain (Folder www for www.URLexample, blog/ for blog.URLexample etc.) and rename it `.htaccess`.
3. Open the `http://www.URLexample/test.html/` file in your web browser, index.php will be executed with the argument “test”.
