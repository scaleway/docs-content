This guide provides detailed instructions on how to access your [Mac mini](/bare-metal/apple-silicon/concepts/#mac-mini) using remote desktop clients.

The macOS on your Mac mini uses the VNC protocol with additional Apple-specific enhancements to provide a remote desktop access.
Remote desktop allows you to visualize the graphical screen output of a remote computer and interact with it using your local keyboard and mouse.
The VNC protocol is platform-independent, supporting Linux, Windows, and macOS, ensuring a seamless connection experience regardless of your operating system.

## Accessing the remote desktop
<Tabs id="os">
  <TabsTab label="macOS">
    If your local machine runs macOS, you can use the Scaleway console to connect to your Mac mini using the built-in Apple ARD client.

    1. Click **Apple silicon** in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu. A list of your Mac minis displays.
        <Lightbox src="scaleway-apple-silicon-dashboard.webp" alt="Scaleway Apple Silicon Dashboard" />
    2. Click the Mac mini you want to connect to. The **Overview** page of your Mac mini displays.
    3. Two options are available to open the remote desktop connection:
        - **macOS** ①: Click **Open remote desktop** in the **Access remote desktop from macOS** section to launch Apple's built-in screen sharing client for a seamless remote desktop experience.
        - **Windows/Linux** ②: Click [How to connect using a different OS](/bare-metal/apple-silicon/how-to/access-remote-desktop-mac-mini/) for detailed steps on selecting the right client, configuring your connection, and resolving common issues for seamless remote access from Linux or Windows.
        <Lightbox src="scaleway-apple-silicon-remote-desktop.webp" alt="Scaleway Apple Silicon remote desktop selector" />

        Once your screen displays in your remote desktop client, log in to the graphical environment of macOS using the remote user and your password (available on the **Overview** page of your Mac mini).

        <Message type="note">
          macOS may ask for your password once logged into the remote desktop session. Change the keyboard layout of macOS to your computer's local keyboard layout before entering the password. Click "U.S. keyboard" in the top right corner to display a list of all available keyboard layouts.

    You are now logged in and can use your Mac mini as if you were physically present.

### Comparison matrix of remote desktop clients

Below is a matrix to compare the different features of the free versions of these remote desktop clients:

| Client                          | Compatible OS | Copy & Paste                               | Streaming Audio<sup>*</sup>          | Security/Tunneling Mode                          | High Quality Compatibility | Display Responsiveness |
|---------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| ARD (integrated)                | macOS         | ✅ (except for password)                   | ❌                       | ✅ auto                                           | ⭐⭐⭐                       | ⭐⭐⭐                   |
| RealVNC                         | Windows, Linux, macOS           | 〰️ (some issues)                          | ❌ (not with free version) | ❌ (manual tunnel) | ❌                         | ⭐ (not recommended)   |
| Remmina                         | Linux         | ✅ (manual, only from local to server)     | ❌                       | ❌ (manual tunnel)                               | ❌                         | ⭐                    |
| Devolutions Remote Desktop Manager | Windows, Linux, macOS       | ✅                                        | ❌                       | ✅ (requires additional setup - SSH tunnel)      | ❌                         | ⭐⭐                    |

<sup>*</sup> These remote desktop clients don't allow audio streaming. If you need audio streaming, we recommend using [Reemo](/tutorials/access-mac-mini-with-reemo/). You need to configure the connection with Reemo using a VNC connection. We recommend first setup an other VNC connection and using this remote desktop client to then configure Reemo.
