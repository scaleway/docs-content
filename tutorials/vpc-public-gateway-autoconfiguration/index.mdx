## Private Networks and Public Gateways - Overview

<NetworkPublicGateways />

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An [Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/)

## Creating a Private Network for the Instance

1. Connect to your Instance using [SSH](/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).
    ```
    ssh root@<your_instance_ip>
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      You can connect to your Instance using its flexible IPv4 or IPv6 address.
    </Message>

2. Check the status of your network interfaces using the `ip a` command. You see the details of the default Ethernet adapter of your Instance:
    ```
    2: enp0s1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
      link/ether de:00:00:7b:1f:91 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
      inet 51.158.99.14/32 metric 100 scope global dynamic enp0s1
        valid_lft 771sec preferred_lft 771sec
      inet6 2001:bc8:710:5c70:dc00:ff:fe7b:1f91/64 scope global dynamic mngtmpaddr noprefixroute 
        valid_lft 86391sec preferred_lft 14391sec
      inet6 fe80::dc00:ff:fe7b:1f91/64 scope link 
        valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    ```
3. Go to the [VPC page](https://console.scaleway.com/vpc/vpc) of the Scaleway console.
4. Click a VPC of the region that covers your Instance's Availability Zone.
5. Click **Create Private Network**. The Private Network creation wizard displays:
    <Lightbox image={image} alt="" />
6. Leave the default settings in place, or enter a customized **name**, **tags** and, in **Advanced Settings**, **CIDR block**.
7. Click **Create Private Network**.
    The Private Network is created inside the specified VPC, and its **Overview** page displays.
8. Click the **Attached Resources** tab to see the list of Instances attached to the Private Network. Currently, no resources are attached.
9. Click **Attach resource** and select your Instance from the dropdown list that displays. Leave the default IPv4 and IPv6 address settings in place, or specify these addresses yourself if you prefer. 
    <Lightbox image={image2} alt="" />
10. Click **Attach to Private Network**. You are returned to the **Attached resources** tab, where your Instance now displays.
11. Use the `ip a` command on the Instance to verify the presence of the new Ethernet interface:
    ```
    3: enp1s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
        link/ether 02:00:00:11:cf:fe brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        inet 172.16.8.2/22 metric 50 brd 172.16.11.255 scope global dynamic enp1s0
          valid_lft 86369sec preferred_lft 86369sec
        inet6 fdf6:47af:d6e7:e60e:d4bf:b161:6073:1c8f/128 scope global dynamic noprefixroute 
          valid_lft 86371sec preferred_lft 71971sec
        inet6 fe80::ff:fe11:cffe/64 scope link 
          valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    ```

The Instance is now added to the Private Network, and the Private Network's inbuilt DHCP has assigned the IPv4 address `172.16.8.2/22` and the IPv6 address `fdf6:47af:d6e7:e60e:d4bf:b161:6073:1c8f/128`.

## Creating a Public Gateway

1. Go to the [Public Gateways page](https://console.scaleway.com/public-gateway/public-gateways) of the Scaleway console, and click **Create a Public Gateway**. The Public Gateway creation wizard displays:
    <Lightbox image={image3} alt="" />
2. Enter the details of the new Public Gateway:
    - Choose the Availability Zone of the Public Gateway. It must match the Availability Zone of your Instance.
    - Select the Public Gateway offer type.
    - Select the Public Gateway IP address. Either allocate a new IP, or use one of your existing Public Gateway flexible IPs. 
    - Enter a name and optional tags for the Public Gateway, or leave the default ones in place.
3. Click **Create a Public Gateway**. The Public Gateway is created, and you are taken to the list of your Public Gateways:
4. Click the Public Gateway you just created to go to its dashboard.
5. Click the **Private Networks** tab, then **Attach to a Private Network**.
    <Lightbox image={image4} alt="" />
6. Configure the attachment:
   - Select the Private Network you previously created from the drop-down list.
   - Either choose a specific IPv4 address to use for the attachment, or leave the default auto-allocation option in place.
   - Activate the toggle to [advertise the default route](/public-gateways/concepts/#default-route)
7. Click **Attach to Private Network**.

    The Public Gateway is attached to the Private Network, and you are returned to the list of Private Networks for this gateway.

    <Message type="note">
      Once the Instance and a Public Gateway advertising the default route are added to the same Private Network, the Instance cannot be accessed through its public IPv4 address anymore. You should use SSH bastion to access your Instances through the Public Gateway's public IPv4 address, as described in the next section.
    </Message>

## Configuring and connecting via SSH bastion

SSH bastion allows you to make secure SSH connections to resources attached to a Public Gateway. In the case of our Instance, we could even detach its public IP addresses, and still connect via the gateway's public IP and the Instance's private IP on the Private Network.

1. Go to the [Public Gateways page](https://console.scaleway.com/public-gateway/public-gateways) of the Scaleway console, and click on the Public Gateway you created previously. Its **Overview** page displays.
2. In the **SSH bastion** panel, click **Activate**.
    <Lightbox image={image5} alt="" />
3. Leave the default port in place, copy the SSH connection command, and click **Save SSH bastion settings**.
   SSH bastion is activated, and all the SSH keys currently associated with your Scaleway Project are uploaded to the bastion.
4. Check that you can connect to your Instance via the gateway's bastion, with the `ssh -J bastion@212.47.227.11:61000 root@1<Private-IP-of-resource` command.Replace `<Private-IP-of-resource>` with the private IP address of your Instance on the Private Network, as established in the previous section. In this case, the command to use is `ssh -J bastion@212.47.227.11:61000 root@172.16.8.2`.
