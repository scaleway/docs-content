Backups are logical data dumps of an individual database. They are useful when you need to restore a specific logical database. 

For Database Instances that use Block Storage volumes, Databases for PostgreSQL and MySQL use the [Snaphots](/databases/databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/manage-snapshots/) feature to create autobackups. When the autobackup feature is enabled, Databases for PostgreSQL and MySQL create and manage backups according to your backup schedule configuration.

  The autobackup feature is enabled by default upon the creation of an Instance. Simultaneously, a backup schedule policy is created. The default backup frequency is of 1 per day and the retention period of 7 days. You can change this default configuration after you create the Instance from the database information page.

  Although autobackup is enabled by default, you can disable the feature before you create the Instance, by unchecking the box in the creation wizard. You can also disable it after the Instance is ready.
