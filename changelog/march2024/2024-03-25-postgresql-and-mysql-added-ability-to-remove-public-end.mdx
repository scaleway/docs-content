Network management on Managed Databases for PostgreSQL and MySQL has been improved! You can now add/remove public endpoints directly from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/). This includes endpoints attached to both Database Instances and Read-Replicas.

Refer to [our documentation](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/remove-public-endpoint/) for more information.
