The Scaleway Containers platform provides you with containerized stateless applications deployed in the cloud.

This page explains how to deploy a basic NGINX image in a Serverless Container using the Scaleway console.

For advanced usage, such as larger projects with dependencies, automation, multiple containers, and more, there are [several ways to deploy containers](/serverless/containers/reference-content/deploy-container/).

Check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-examples) for real-world examples.

## How to deploy a Serverless Container

You can deploy a container either from the Scaleway Container Registry or any other public container registry (Docker Hub, AWS Container registries, GitLab container registry, etc.).

### Deploy from the Scaleway Container Registry

If you have no existing Serverless Containers resources in your current Project, the creation process will guide you through the creation of a namespace, and then a container.

<Message type="note">
  Make sure that you have [created a Container Registry namespace](/containers/container-registry/how-to/create-namespace/) and [pushed the latest NGINX Docker image](/containers/container-registry/how-to/push-images/) to it.

2. Click **Deploy container**. The containers namespace creation wizard displays.
3. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 
    - Enter a **name** or use the automatically generated one. The name can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes.
    - Enter a **description** (optional). 
    - Choose a **region**, which is the geographical location in which your namespace will be deployed.
4. Click **Create namespace and add container**. The container creation wizard displays.

    - Enter a **description** (optional).
    - Choose the smallest **resources** available to allocate to your container.
    - Leave the default **scaling** values.
    - In the **Advanced options**, set the **Container privacy policy** to **public**.
    - Verify the estimated cost.
