## Attach

Attaching storage to your Scaleway Instance allows you to use additional or shared storage beyond its [Local Storage](/local-storage/).

Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/file-storage/how-to/attach-file-system/) for information on how to attach a file system.

## Availability Zone

<AvailabilityZone />

## File Storage

Scaleway File Storage allows you to keep data in an organized hierarchy of files and folders. This hierarchy can be shared across a network, so multiple compute instances can work on the same collection of files.

## File system

A file system provides a structured way to manage files and directories in the cloud, so that Instances can access, read, and write data as if it were on a local disk. File systems can be shared by several [Instances](/instances/).

Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/file-storage/how-to/create-file-system/) for information on how to create a file system.

## Mount

Mounting a storage volume allows you you to assign a directory (mount point) to an [attached](#attach) storage volume. The files on that storage become available via the assigned directory. This allows you to read and write files on the storage as if they were part of your local file system.

Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/file-storage/how-to/mount-file-system/) for information on how to mount a file system.

## Region
