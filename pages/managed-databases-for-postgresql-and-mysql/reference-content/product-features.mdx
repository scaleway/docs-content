# Quickstart: Create an Instance

This guide shows you how to create and connect to a Scaleway Instance in just a few steps.

## Requirements

- You have a Scaleway account. [Create one here](https://console.scaleway.com/register).
- You are logged in to the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com).
- You have created an API key (optional for CLI steps).

## Create via Console

1. Go to the **Compute > Instances** section in the console.
2. Click **Create an Instance**.
3. Choose an image (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04).
4. Select an instance type (e.g., DEV1-S).
5. Choose a region (e.g., `fr-par-1`).
6. Click **Create Instance**.

The root password will be sent to your email.

## Connect via SSH

Once the instance is running:

```bash
ssh root@<instance_public_ip>
```

Tip: Use SSH keys for better security. See [managing SSH keys](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/instance/how-to/connect-using-ssh-keys/).

## Next Steps

- [Customize your instance](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/instance/how-to/configure-instance/)
- [Set up a private network](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/network/vpc/quickstart/)
- [Explore the API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/instance/api/reference/)
```

# How to Connect to an Instance Using SSH Keys

This guide explains how to use SSH keys to connect to your Scaleway Instance instead of using passwords.

## Prerequisites

- A running Scaleway Instance.
- SSH key pair generated (`id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`, or use `ssh-keygen`).

## Step 1: Add Your Public Key in the Console

1. Go to **Compute > Instances**.
2. In the left sidebar, click **SSH Keys**.
3. Click **Add an SSH key**.
4. Enter a name (e.g., `my-laptop`) and paste your public key (the content of `id_rsa.pub`).
5. Click **Add**.

## Step 2: Attach Key During Instance Creation

When creating a new instance:
- In the **Security** section, select your SSH key.
- The instance will allow SSH access using your private key.

## Step 3: Connect via SSH

```bash
ssh root@<instance_public_ip>
```

No password needed if your key is set up correctly.

## Troubleshooting

- **Error: Permission denied (publickey)**
  Ensure your SSH agent is running:
  ```bash
  eval $(ssh-agent)
  ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  ```

- **Key not loading?**
  Confirm the public key in the console matches your `.pub` file.

title: "Concepts: Bootscripts"
description: Understand what bootscripts are and how they control instance startup.

# Concepts: Bootscripts

A **bootscript** is a predefined configuration that tells a Scaleway Instance which kernel and initrd to load at boot time.

## Why Use Bootscripts?

Bootscripts allow you to:
- Boot from custom kernels.
- Enable specific features like rescue mode.
- Use alternative operating systems.

## Types of Bootscripts

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `normal` | Standard boot using the default kernel. |
| `rescue` | Boots into a minimal environment for troubleshooting. |
| `boot2docker` | Legacy mode for Docker hosts (deprecated). |

## Default Behavior

When you create an instance:
- The system automatically assigns a compatible bootscript based on the selected image.
- You can override this in the API or console.

## Example Use Case

You want to debug a misconfigured firewall:
1. Stop the instance.
2. Change bootscript to `rescue`.
3. Restart and access via SSH.
4. Modify configuration files directly.

Related: [How to use rescue mode](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/instance/how-to/use-rescue-mode/)

## Limitations

- Not all instance types support all bootscripts.
- ARM64 instances have limited bootscript options.

description: Diagnose and fix issues when a Scaleway Instance fails to start.

# Troubleshooting: Instance Won't Boot

If your Scaleway Instance fails to start or remains stuck in "starting" state, follow these steps.

## 1. Check Instance Status

In the **Instances** dashboard:
- Is the status `starting`, `error`, or `stopped`?
- Are there any alerts or messages?

Tip: Wait up to 2 minutes after creation; some images take longer.

## 2. Verify Bootscript and Image Compatibility

An incompatible bootscript can prevent booting.

Fix:
- Go to instance settings.
- Ensure the bootscript matches the image (e.g., `normal` for most Linux images).

## 3. Inspect the Boot Logs

1. In the console, go to your instance.
2. Click **Boot Logs**.
3. Look for:
   - Kernel panic
   - Missing root device
   - Filesystem errors

Example: `VFS: Unable to mount root fs` → corrupted image or volume.

## 4. Try Rescue Mode

Boot into rescue mode to inspect the filesystem:

1. Stop the instance.
2. Edit → Change bootscript to `rescue`.
3. Start the instance.
4. Connect via SSH and run:
   ```bash
   fsck /dev/root
   ```

## 5. Reattach the Boot Volume

Sometimes the volume becomes detached.

Fix:
- Detach and reattach the boot volume in the **Volumes** tab.

## Still Not Working?

Contact Scaleway Support with:
- Instance ID
- Screenshot of boot logs
- Steps already tried
