VPC allows you to build your own **V**irtual **P**rivate **C**loud on top of Scaleway's shared public cloud. One default VPC per region is automatically created per Scaleway [Project](/console/my-project/concepts/#project), and you can create more if you wish. Within each VPC, you can create **Private Networks** and attach Scaleway resources (Instances, Elastic Metal servers, Load Balancers etc.) to them, as long as the resources are within the network's region. Attached resources can then communicate between themselves in an isolated and secure virtual layer 2 network, away from the public Internet. More features and resources will be coming to the VPC product in the future.

## How to identify your default VPCs

One default VPC per region is automatically created per Scaleway [Project](/console/my-project/concepts/#project). You can [create more](/network/vpc/create-vpc#how-to-create-a-vpc) if you wish, but it is not necessary for basic use cases.

Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the Scaleway console side menu. Your VPC dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/vpc/vpc) displays:

        <Lightbox src="scaleway-vpc.webp" alt="" />
        TODO check screenshot

You see three default VPCs, one for each of the following regions:

- Paris `PAR`
- Amsterdam `AMS`
- Warsaw `WAW`

Any new Private Networks that you create will be added to the default VPC for their region, unless you override this by specifying a different VPC. 

## How to create a Private Network

As explained above, a Private Network must be created in a VPC.

1. Click the VPC you want to create the Private Network in.

    If you already have existing Private Networks in this VPC, a list of these displays. Otherwise, you see a welcome screen.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-reg-pn.webp" alt="" />
    TODO check

2. Click **+ Create Private Network**. The creation screen displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-rpn.webp" alt=""/>
    TODO check

4. Enter a **name** for the network, or leave the randomly-generated name in place. Optionally, you can also add one or many tags to help you organize your Private Networks. 

    Leave the Advanced Settings at default values, to create a network with an auto-generated CIDR block, which will be used by DHCP to assign private IP addresses to resources you attach to the network.

5. Click **Create Private Network** to finish. Your Private Network is created. You are taken back to the **Private Networks** dashboard of your VPC [TODO CHECK not overview page], where your new Private Network is now displayed in the list.


## How to attach a resource to a Private Network

TODO check these steps

1. From your Private Network's dashboard, click the **Attached resources** tab.

    If you already have resources attached to the Private Network, a list of these displays. Otherwise, you see a welcome screen.

2. Click **+Attach resource**. The following screen displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-attach-resource.webp" alt="" />

3. Select the type of resource (Instance, Elastic Metal server etc.) that you want to attach. Then select the specific resource to attach. Only resources within the same region (or one of its Availability Zones) as the Private Network will be displayed.

4. Click **Attach resource** to finish.

    You are returned to the list of attached resources, where the newly-attached resource now displays.

## How to configure resources in a Private Network

Since DHCP is automatically configured on Private Networks, resources will automatically receive private IP addresses.

These can be viewed [here](TODO)

## How to delete a Private Network

1. Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the side menu.

    A default VPC for each available region has been automatically created for you.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-vpc.webp" alt="" />

2. Click the **Default VPC** for your chosen region.

    A list of your Private Networks in this VPC displays.

3. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the Private Network you want to delete, then click **Delete** on the pop-up menu.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-delete-rpn.webp" alt="" />

    A screen displays asking you to confirm that you want to delete the network, and that you have detached all resources from it.

4. Type **DELETE** and click **Delete Private Network**.

  Your Private Network is deleted.
