## Alias

Each [Organization](#organization) can have an alias set up by an Organization Manager. Once set-up, all members can log in using a dedicated URL for the Organization using the alias, under the format [alias].account.scaleway.com

## API key

An API key is a unique identifier, used to authenticate requests made to the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/). An API key consists of an access key and a secret key. The access key is like a unique ID or username, and is not a sensitive piece of information. The secret key is more sensitive as it is like a password to authenticate the access key.
API keys can have a validity duration defined by its creator. The maximum validity duration can also be enforced by an IAM administrator.

## Console session

A console session is an active, authenticated user session that allows interaction with the Scaleway console. Console sessions duration can be limited by an IAM administrator.

## Grace period

The grace period is the time an [IAM Member](#members) has to comply with the security requirements that are enforced in your Organization before their account is automatically locked. The accounts can be manually unlocked by an Owner or IAM Manager. Upon regaining access, the grace period resets, giving IAM Members another chance to meet security requirements.

## IAM administrator

An IAM administator can be the Owner of the Organization, or any IAM member with permission sets enabling them to perform administrative actions in the Organization, such as managing members or enforcing Security Requierements.


## Identity Provider

An Identity Provider (IdP) is a service that authenticates users and provides identity information to Scaleway to enable secure access through Single Sign-On (SSO)


## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security method that requires users to verify their identity using two or more independent factors, such as something they know, have, or are, before logging into an [Organization](/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#organization).

## SAML

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is a standard protocol that enables secure authentication by exchanging identity and authorization data between an identity provider and a service provider.

## Security requirements

Security requirements are a set of actions that must be underdone by all members of an Organization to be compliant with its security standards. Security requirements can be enforced by an IAM administrator.

## Single Sign-On (SSO)

Single sign-on (SSO) allows users to access multiple applications - including Scaelway - with one set of login credentials through a centralized authentication system.
