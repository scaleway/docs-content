When you order an Elastic Metal server with monthly billing, you pay a commitment fee to cover the setup cost of your machine. This fee grants you a lower monthly price and gives you the right to receive a loyalty reward if your server is up and running for 12 consecutive months without termination.

The value of the reward is a cloud service voucher in the sum of the commitment fees paid at the time of purchase. The voucher is valid for six months, and you can use it for all Scaleway Cloud products except the Bare Metal category (hourly and monthly Elastic Metal, Apple Silicon, and their associated options). You receive the reward once per physical server, and it is automatically added to your Scaleway account.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An Elastic Metal server that has been up and running for 12 consecutive months


The following rules apply to the loyalty reward:

* You are entitled to the loyalty reward:
   * Once you have kept your Elastic Metal server running for 12 consecutive months without stopping,
   * Once per physical server in your account.

* The loyalty reward:
   * Corresponds to the sum of the commitment fee paid when the server was ordered (excl. taxes).
   * Is usable for all cloud resources except Bare Metal servers and their related options.
   * Is valid for six months.
   * Is splittable over several months.

<Message type="tip">
  The reward is available for six months and can be consumed pro rata per month or all at once. For example, if you received €49 of credit and consumed €15 of cloud resources during the first month, we will roll over the remaining €34 in the next month.

  The loyalty reward is a cloud service voucher that can be used to consume Scaleway Cloud resources (except Bare Metal servers and their associated options). It is not possible to get a cash refund of the commitment fees.
