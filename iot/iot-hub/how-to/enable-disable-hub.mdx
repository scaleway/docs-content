You can enable or disable your IoT Hub from the Scaleway console. This can be useful if you want to do maintenance actions on your hub, or if you want to change the [product plan](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/change-plan) of your hub.

  As long as a Hub is disabled it will not be billed, but its devices won't be able to connect.
