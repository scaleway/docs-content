## Why should you use Scaleway Key Manager?

Key Manager helps organizations achieve secure key management by handling low-level and error-prone cryptographic details for you.

## What features does Scaleway Key Manager include?

Scaleway Key Manager allows you to create, manage, and use cryptographic keys in a centralized and secure service. All your cryptographic operations can be delegated to Key Manager, which in turn ensures the security and availability of your keys.

## Which management methods can I use with Key Manager?

Read our [dedicated documentation](/key-manager/reference-content/understanding-key-manager/#management-methods-you-can-use-with-key-manager) to find out about the management methods Key Manager provides.

## Which cryptographic operations does Key Manager support?

Key Manager supports the three following cryptographic operations:

- [Encryption](/key-manager/concepts/#encryption)
- [Decryption](/key-manager/concepts/#decryption)
- [Data encryption key](/key-manager/concepts/#data-encryption-key-dek) generation
- [Signature](/key-manager/concepts/#signature)
- [Signature verification](/key-manager/concepts/#signature-verification)


## Which algorithms and key usage does Key Manager support?

<Macro id="encryption" />

Key Manager supports multiple [key usages](/key-manager/concepts/#key-usage) to suit different cryptographic operations:

- Keys with a usage set to `symmetric_encryption` are used to encrypt and decrypt data using symmetric algorithms.
- Keys with a usage set to `asymmetric_encryption` are used for encrypting and decrypting data with asymmetric algorithms, typically involving a public-private key pair.
- Keys with a usage set to `asymmetric_signing` are used for generating and verifying digital signatures, ensuring data authenticity and integrity.
