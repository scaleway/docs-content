## FATAL: password authentication failed for user

### Problem

The error message below appears when trying to connect to the Serverless SQL Database:

    ```
    FATAL: password authentication failed for user "example-fafb-4c6c-a406-911d9675a703"
    ```

### Cause

You either used the wrong password/IAM secret key, or the wrong username/IAM user ID/application ID.

### Solution

Make sure that you use the correct user/application ID and secret key combination.

## FATAL: principal does not have permission to access database

### Problem

The error message below appears when trying to connect to the Serverless SQL Database:

    ```
    FATAL: principal example-fafb-4c6c-a406-911d9675a703 does not have permission to access database example-a2ea-4f6e-bbe5-791a1b6905ff
    ```

### Cause

The [IAM principal](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#principal) (user or application) does not have the necessary permissions to connect the database.

### Solution

[Create a new IAM policy](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-policy/) or [update an existing one](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/manage-policies/#how-to-edit-a-policys-rules) to grant one of the following permissions sets to the user or application:
  - `ServerlessSQLDatabaseReadOnly`
  - `ServerlessSQLDatabaseReadWrite`
  - `ServerlessSQLDatabaseFullAccess`

## Database hostname wasn't sent to server

### Problem

The error message below appears when trying to connect to the Serverless SQL Database:

  ```
  Error: pq: Database hostname wasn't sent to server
  ```

### Cause

This error happens when the SQL client you are using does not support the TLS Server Name Indication (SNI) feature.

### Solution

- If you are using a third-party tool or library which allows you to input a connection string or optional connection parameters,  add `?options=databaseid%3D{databaseid}` at the end of your [connection string](/serverless/sql-databases/how-to/connect-to-a-database/#how-to-connect-to-a-database-as-a-user):
    ```
    "postgresql://{username}:{password}@{host}:5432/{databasename}?sslmode=require&options=databaseid%3D{databaseid}"
  ```
  Or
  ```hcl
  terraform {
    backend "pg" {
      conn_str = "postgresql://{username}:{password}@{host}:5432/{databasename}?sslmode=require&options=databaseid%3D{databaseid}"
    }
    required_providers {
      scaleway = {
        source = "scaleway/scaleway"
      }
    }
    required_version = ">= 0.13"
  }
  ```
- If you cannot modify the connection string or optional connection parameters, upgrade or change your client library. Refer to the table below for the most common libraries and tools supporting SNI.
