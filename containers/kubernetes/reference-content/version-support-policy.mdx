[Kubernetes (K8s)](https://kubernetes.io) is an open source project that is constantly evolving, integrating and deprecating features and applying bug fixes. The project is supported by the community, which releases between four and six new minor versions every year.

With Scaleway Kubernetes, you can use the latest version of Kubernetes as soon as it is officially released and certified by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/). The versions are usually available in Kubernetes Kapsule and Kubernetes Kosmos within a few days after the release.

## Version management recommendation

We recommend that you keep your Kubernetes clusters up-to-date with the latest available minor version of Kubernetes and the latest patches.

<Message type="note">
  Each minor Kubernetes version is supported by Scaleway Kubernetes for at least twelve months before being deprecated.

### Cluster auto-upgrade

Before using the auto-upgrade feature, it is essential to differentiate between patch upgrades and minor version upgrades in Kubernetes. While a patch upgrade typically focuses on bug fixes and security patches without altering existing functionalities, a minor version upgrade introduces new features and changes.

The [Kubernetes Kapsule](https://www.scaleway.com/en/kubernetes-kapsule/) and [Kubernetes Kosmos](https://www.scaleway.com/en/kubernetes-kosmos/) platforms offer an auto-upgrade feature to address patch upgrades within the same minor Kubernetes version you are currently using. This means that the feature allows for updates to the latest patch, ensuring enhanced security and stability without introducing major changes.

This upgrade applies to both the control plane and the managed node versions of Kubernetes. You can activate this feature through the API, CLI, or the Scaleway console. Note, to ensure smooth operation of the auto-upgrade, the `kube-system` namespace should remain untouched and free from any user-initiated modifications that might cause issues with the upgrade process.

If you are looking to upgrade to the next minor version of Kubernetes, refer to our [documentation on upgrading to the next minor version](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/upgrade-kubernetes-version/).

## Support

Before opening a support ticket related to cluster behavior or a Kubernetes component, we highly recommend that you upgrade the cluster to the latest version of Kubernetes. If the upgrade to a new minor version is not possible, the latest patch of the version running on the cluster must be applied.

80% of Kubernetes issues are usually fixed when applying the latest patch version available.

## Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule & Kosmos release calendar

* **Official End of Life:** Upstream [end of maintenance support](https://endoflife.date/kubernetes).
* **Scaleway Release:** Version is available for Kubernetes Kapsule and Kubernetes Kosmos cluster creation and cluster upgrade.
* **Deprecation:** Version is removed from cluster creation option. Customers are informed via a support ticket that they are using a deprecated version of Kubernetes and are asked to update their clusters.
* **End of Support:** Version is not supported anymore, clusters will be automatically upgraded to the next supported minor version.

<Message type="note">
When a minor version becomes unsupported, Scaleway operates an upgrade to the latest patch version of the next supported minor version within the next 30 days. You will be notified via ticket.

<Message type="important">
* New support policy: from the release of version 1.29, Scaleway's support window has shifted to 14 months.
We are discontinuing extended support for outdated upstream Kubernetes releases to ensure you can always benefit from the latest features, bug fixes, enhanced support and maximum security.
Consequently, versions `1.27` and  `1.28` will have corresponding end of support timelines.

## Supported Container Network Interfaces (CNI)

Starting from Kubernetes version 1.25 launch:
* Kubernetes Kapsule only supports **cilium** and **calico** as CNI.
* Kubernetes Kosmos only supports **kilo** as CNI.

| Interface |   Obsolete  |
|-----------|-------------|
| Flannel   |  from v1.25 |
| Weave     |  from v1.25 |

* Migration policy:
  * Control planes cannot be upgraded on obsolete CNIs.
  * *Recommended action:* Create new clusters using a supported CNI, either via API or from the Scaleway console.

<Message type="important">
Clusters still running unsupported CNIs (Flannel, Weave) cannot be upgraded manually. While migrating to v1.25 (May 15th, 2024), Scaleway will change the [CNI configuration](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/kubernetes/#path-clusters-update-a-cluster-response-cni) to `none`.

## Supported Container Runtime Interfaces (CRI)

Starting from the launch of Kubernetes version 1.25, **containerd** is the only runtime supported by Scaleway Kubernetes products.
