This tutorial shows how to build a custom image for Scaleway from scratch using the new export/import feature.

It introduces the basic needs and actions to create a custom image, but each operating system may have specifics that need to be troubleshooted individually.

<Message type="important">
The procedure introduced in this tutorial is specific to OpenWrt, an open-source project for embedded operating systems based on Linux. It is primarily used to route network traffic.
</Message>

To create a custom image, you need to build a [QCOW2 image](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Qcow2/) and [create a snapshot](/compute/instances/how-to/create-a-snapshot/) from it.

The following steps are required to create the image:

- Download an OS disk image
- Convert it to QCOW2 (if not provided in this format)
- Edit the image to fit Scaleway's ecosystem
- Upload the image to Scaleway Object Storage
- Convert to Snapshot through import
- Test the image and troubleshoot via the Console

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An [Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)

The following commands are done on an Ubuntu 22.04.

## Download the image

The needed image must be a full disk image, not an ISO image or only a rootfs.

In order to work on Scaleway Instances, the image must be using EFI (not just BIOS) to boot.

OpenWrt images are available [here](https://openwrt.org/downloads/), we are going to use a stable release, for `x86_64` architecture, with EFI.

Download the image we are going to use in this tutorial:

  ```
  curl -sSLO https://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/22.03.2/targets/x86/64/openwrt-22.03.2-x86-64-generic-ext4-combined-efi.img.gz
  gunzip openwrt-22.03.2-x86-64-generic-ext4-combined-efi.img.gz
  ```

## Prepare the QCOW2 image

<Message type="note">

QCOW2 images are container images used in [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) as virtual disks.

</Message>

1. Install the needed QEMU tools:

    ```
    apt-get install qemu-utils -y
    ```

2. Convert the image and resize the target disk size (minimum disk size at Scaleway = 1 GB):

    ```
    qemu-img convert -f raw -O qcow2 openwrt-22.03.2-x86-64-generic-ext4-combined-efi.img openwrt-22.03.2-x86-64-generic-ext4-combined-efi.qcow2
    qemu-img resize openwrt-22.03.2-x86-64-generic-ext4-combined-efi.qcow2 1G
    ```

3. Mount the QCOW2 image as a device

    ```
    modprobe nbd
    qemu-nbd -c /dev/nbd0 openwrt-22.03.2-x86-64-generic-ext4-combined-efi.qcow2
    ```

    <Message type="important">

    Conversion and resizing create errors in the partition table which are fixed when re-writing it using fdisk. Furthermore, To resize the main partition, the partition number must be found.

    To print and fix the partition table, do:

    ```
    echo 'p\nw\n' | fdisk /dev/nbd0
    ```

    </Message>

4. Resize the main partition to fit the available space (partition number 2 in the example above):

    ```
    growpart /dev/nbd0 2
    resize2fs /dev/nbd0p2
    ```

## Edit the image content

<Message type="note">

Network configuration and specific actions may need to be configured to access the image when run in Scaleway Instances.

For example:

* In Scaleway Instances, the first NIC (e.g. `eth0`) must be associated with the public network and need to be configured (e.g. with cloud-init, DHCP, or another method.)

* If the image provides a GUI, it may need to be configured to allow access from the public interface (are specific ports or firewall rules required?)

* How to manage the SSH access (set user password or configure SSH keys?)

</Message>


1. Mount the image:

    ```
    mkdir -p /mount/temp
    mount /dev/nbd0p2 /mount/temp
    ```

    OpenWrt needs two interfaces to work (WAN and LAN). But a default Instance only provides one interface. We are going to use the dummy module to add an interface.

2. Download the package.

    ```
    curl -sSL -o /mount/temp/kmod-dummy_5.10.146-1_x86_64.ipk https://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/22.03.2/targets/x86/64/packages/kmod-dummy_5.10.146-1_x86_64.ipk
    ```

3. Chroot in the image.

    ```
    chroot /mount/temp/ /bin/ash
    ```

4. Install the package.

    ```
    mkdir -p /tmp/lock
    opkg install kmod-dummy_5.10.146-1_x86_64.ipk
    rm -rf /tmp/* kmod-dummy_5.10.146-1_x86_64.ipk
    ```

5. Set the root password, whilst in the chroot. In OpenWrt, it is used by the web interface for login.

    ```
    passwd
    ```

6. Configure the web server ports and redirect `http` to `https` using the `uci` CLI of OpenWrt.

    ```
    uci del uhttpd.main.listen_http
    uci add_list uhttpd.main.listen_http='0.0.0.0:8080'
    uci del uhttpd.main.listen_https
    uci add_list uhttpd.main.listen_https='0.0.0.0:8443'
    uci set uhttpd.main.redirect_https=1
    uci commit uhttpd
    ```

7. Disable password authentication in SSH.

    ```
    uci set dropbear.@dropbear[0].PasswordAuth=off
    uci set dropbear.@dropbear[0].RootPasswordAuth=off
    uci commit dropbear
    ```
### Configure SSH access

Since we have disabled password authentication in SSH, we need a way to load SSH keys when running.

In this tutorial, we do not set up cloud-init, but use the same magic IP mechanism to get the keys.

1. Create the `authorized_keys` file:

    ```
    touch /etc/dropbear/authorized_keys
    chmod 600 /etc/dropbear/authorized_keys
    ```

2. Create the fetch script:

    ```sh
    cat <<EOF>/etc/init.d/fetch_ssh_keys
    #!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common

    START=97

    start() {
        echo -e "\nFetching SSH keys from Scaleway Metadata" > /dev/console
        wget -qO- http://169.254.42.42/conf | egrep 'SSH_PUBLIC_KEYS_._KEY' | cut -d'=' -f2- | sed "s/'//g" > /etc/dropbear/authorized_keys
    }

    reload() {
        start
    }
    EOF
    chmod +x /etc/init.d/fetch_ssh_keys
    ```

3. Add the script to `rc.d`.

    ```sh
    ln -s /etc/init.d/fetch_ssh_keys /etc/rc.d/S97fetch_ssh_keys
    ```

4. Exit the chroot.

    ```
    exit
    ```

### Configure the network

1. Configure the network to be able to use the image on a Scaleway Instance:

    ```
    cat <<EOF>/mount/temp/etc/config/network
    config interface 'loopback'
    option device 'lo'
    option proto 'static'
    option ipaddr '127.0.0.1'
    option netmask '255.0.0.0'

    config interface 'wan'
    option device 'eth0'
    option proto 'dhcp'

    config interface 'lan'
    option device 'dummy0'
    option proto 'static'
    option ipaddr '192.168.0.1'
    option netmask '255.255.255.0'
    EOF
    ```

    <Message type="important">

    `eth0` is the first interface associated by Scaleway Instances to the public network (WAN) and needs to be available to our DHCP server for configuration.

    </Message>

2. Add firewall rules to redirect WAN ports to LAN ports. This is required, as accessing the UI and SSH in OpenWrt is normally only possible through the LAN interface.

    ```
    cat <<EOF>>/mount/temp/etc/config/firewall
    # port redirect UI ACCESS and SSH
    config redirect
    option name             HTTP-UI
    option src              wan
    option src_dport        8080
    option desti            lan
    option dest_ip          192.168.0.1
    option dest_port        8080
    option proto            tcp

    config redirect
    option name             HTTPS-UI
    option src              wan
    option src_dport        8443
    option dest             lan
    option dest_ip          192.168.0.1
    option dest_port        8443
    option proto            tcp

    config redirect
    option name             SSH
    option src              wan
    option src_dport        22
    option dest             lan
    option dest_ip          192.168.0.1
    option dest_port        22
    option proto            tcp
    EOF
    ```

3. Unmount the image container to finish editing its content.

    ```
    umount /mount/temp
    qemu-nbd -d /dev/nbd0
    ```

## Import the image

You can use the Scaleway console or your favorite S3 CLI to upload objects into a bucket.

In this example, we use the [AWS CLI](/storage/object/api-cli/object-storage-aws-cli/).

1. Import the image into your bucket:

    ```
    aws s3 cp openwrt-22.03.2-x86-64-generic-ext4-combined-efi.qcow2 s3://my-import-bucket/openwrt.qcow2
    ```

2. Trigger the import of the image as a snapshot in one of the regions where the bucket is located, using [SCW CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/):

    ```
    scw instance snapshot create name=openwrt volume-type=b_ssd bucket=my-import-bucket key=openwrt.qcow2
    ```

3. Create the corresponding Instance image:

    ```
    scw instance image create name=openwrt arch=x86_64 snapshot-id=$(scw instance snapshot list | grep -m1 openwrt | awk '{print $1}')
    ```

## Testing and troubleshooting the image

1. Create an Instance using the snapshot image:

    ```
    scw instance server create type=DEV1-S name=scw-openwrt ip=new image=$(scw instance image list | grep -m1 openwrt | awk '{print $1}')
    ```

2. Troubleshoot the boot behavior and configuration using the console of your Instance:

    ```
    scw instance server console $(scw instance server list | grep -m1 scw-openwrt | awk '{print $1}')
    ```


3. Exit the console using `Ctrl+q`.

You can access the web console of OpenWrt using `https://<public ip of instance>:8443`
