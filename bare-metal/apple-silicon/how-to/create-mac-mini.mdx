This page shows how to create your first [Mac mini](/bare-metal/apple-silicon/concepts/#mac-mini) with the Scaleway console.

## Requirements

- Be the [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) of the Organization in which the actions will be performed, or an IAM user with the [necessary permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission)
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- An [SSH key](/console/project/how-to/create-ssh-key/) added to your account

<Message type="important">
  Due to license constraints, the minimum lease for Apple silicon is 24 hours. As a result, the earliest you can delete a Mac mini is 24 hours after the start of its lease.

1. Click **Apple silicon** in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu. The Apple silicon splash page displays.

      Should your account already contain Mac minis, a list of these will be displayed rather than the Apple silicon splash page.
      Alongside, you will see the (<Icon name="plus" />) icon, which you can click on to create a new Mac mini, if desired.

2. Click **Create Mac mini**. The Mac mini creation wizard displays.
3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Choose an **Availability Zone**, which is the geographical region where your Mac mini will be deployed.
    - Select the hardware configuration for your Mac mini.
    - Enter a **Name** for your Mac mini, or leave the randomly-generated name in place.
    - Verify the **Estimated cost** for your Mac mini based on your chosen specifications.
4. Click **Create Mac mini** to finish. The installation of your Apple silicon is launched, and you are informed when it is ready.
