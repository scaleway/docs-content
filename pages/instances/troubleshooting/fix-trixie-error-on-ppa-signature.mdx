When running `apt-get update` on Debian Trixie the following message may appear:

```

On Debian Trixie, the Debian project has started to use `sqv` for the signature verification instead of `gpgv` as it was done previously. This tool allows for the verification of the SHA1 signature date. As of February 1st 2026, the signatures for the Ubuntu PPA are considered insecured and, hence, rejected by the verification tool.

The Ubuntu project still uses `gpgv` for the verification up to its upcoming LTS release Ubuntu 26.04 Resolute Rackoon. This explains why the PPA signatures have not been re-signed with safer algorithms.

Scaleway plans to release its own package archive later this year to avoid such situations where we have no control over archive signatures. Until then, the verification date has been overriden to 01-02-2028 to avoid those messages.

If you are facing this situation, you can apply the fix that has been deployed in recent Debian Trixie images and which is present in the latest `scaleway-ecosystem` package (version 0.0.13-1). To apply the workaround, execute the following commands:
```
mkdir -p /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends
cat << EOF > /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/apt-sequoia.config
# THIS FILE IS MAINTAINED BY scaleway-ecosystem
#
# This override file is added by Scaleway to avoid warning messages caused
# by the use of PPA for delivering Scaleway specific packages.
# This will be removed when we implement our own package distribution method
# later this year
[hash_algorithms]
sha1.second_preimage_resistance = 2028-02-01    # Extend the expiry for legacy repositories
EOF
```

On recent Debian Trixie images, the following message may appear:
```
Warning: http://ppa.launchpad.net/scaleway/debian-stable/ubuntu/dists/focal/InRelease: Policy will reject signature within a year, see --audit for details
Warning: http://ppa.launchpad.net/scaleway/debian-stable/ubuntu/dists/jammy/InRelease: Policy will reject signature within a year, see --audit for details
```
In this case the solution is to remove the override file that was added to the image and install the latest scaleway-ecosystem package :

```
rm -f /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/apt-sequoia.config
apt -y install scaleway-ecosystem
```
