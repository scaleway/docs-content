## Data security measures by Scaleway AI Services

Scaleway's AI services implement robust security measures to ensure customer data privacy and integrity. Below is an overview of these practices.

### Data usage policies

Scaleway's Managed Inference services adhere to the following data usage policies:

- **Stateless models**: Scaleway's models do not retain any prompts or generated content after processing.
  - Prompts or completions are not stored within the model.
  - Data is not used for training, retraining, or improving the base models.

- **Data isolation**: Customer data, including prompts, completions, embeddings, and training data, remains isolated and secure:
  - Data is not accessible to other Scaleway customers.
  - Data is not accessible to the creators of the underlying large language models (LLMs).
  - Data is not used to improve Scaleway or third-party products, services, or models.

- **Service control and hosting**: Scaleway maintains full control over the Managed Inference service, hosting the LLMs on its infrastructure in Europe without interaction with third-party services.

### Data storage policies

- **Customer Data**: Inputs and outputs processed during inference are considered customer data. Scaleway does not log this data unless explicitly permitted by the customer through an opt-in feature, which is not yet available.

### Data security measures

- **Hosting:** Models deployed or consumed for inference are hosted in Europe within the data center region specified by the customer.
- **Encryption**: All traffic between the customer and the inference service is encrypted using in-transit TLS encryption to ensure data protection during transmission.
- **Endpoint Security**: Public-facing endpoints are secured with API key tokens.
- **Allowed IPs**: Public endpoints can be configured to restrict access to specific IP addresses or IP blocks.
- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: The service can be hosted in a Virtual Private Cloud within private subnets. Access to the service can be restricted based on allowed IP ranges.
