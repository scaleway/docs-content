The header of an email contains essential information about the path and origins of the email before it arrives in your mailbox. It is comparable to the postmark and routing information on a physical envelope sent through the mail.

## Why email headers are important

Email headers can provide crucial information about the origin of an email, the servers it passed through, and various technical details that may help in troubleshooting or verifying the authenticity of the email.
Email headers are often required when reporting spam, investigating delivery issues, or diagnosing potential security threats. In some cases, email headers may contain information required by technical support to diagnose issues or verify the authenticity of an email. The method for retrieving this information varies depending on the email client you use.
