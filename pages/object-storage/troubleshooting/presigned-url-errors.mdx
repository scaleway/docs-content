import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## Problem

I am receiving errors when using a presigned URL to access an object.

## Cause

- A clock skew of more than 15 minutes between the host and client will trigger a `InvalidSignatureException` or a `RequestTimeTooSkewed` error

- The public link of your [private object](/object-storage/concepts/) has expired

## Possible solutions

- Make sure that there is less than 15 minutes of clock skew between the host and client machines.

- Make sure that the object's public link has not expired.

## Going further

- Refer to the [documentation on sharing objects](/object-storage/how-to/access-objects-via-https/) for more information on public links.
- If you did not manage to identify the error and solve it by yourself, [open a support ticket](/account/how-to/open-a-support-ticket/), and provide as many details as possible, along with the necessary information below:
    - Object Storage Endpoint (e.g. `s3.fr-par.scw.cloud`)
    - Bucket name
    - Object name (if the request concerns an object)
    - Request type (PUT, GET, etc.)
    - HTTP status code
    - Date and time (timestamp)
    - User-agent (SDK, client, console, etc.)
    - Transaction ID (if possible)
    - Log / trace of the error (if possible)
