We released a fix for the Debian Bullseye OS image to avoid an issue when updating the operating system. This fix is immediately available for DEV1/GP1/PLAY2/PRO2 Instances. 
For ENT1 Instances, we are working with Debian to include the bug fixes. Please watch the changelog for the update. 

If you encounter an issue with the Debian Bullseye OS image after updating the operating-system (error: `filesystem is mounted as read-only`), 
follow our [documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/instances/troubleshooting/reboot-from-faulty-kernel/) to boot your Instance in recovery mode and recover to a working kernel version.
