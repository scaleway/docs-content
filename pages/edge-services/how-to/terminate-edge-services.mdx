Edge Services is an additional feature for Scaleway Load Balancers and Object Storage buckets. It offers a powerful caching service, a customizable Edge Services endpoint, and a Web Application Firefall. To use Edge Services, you must subscribe to a monthly plan.

## How to terminate your Edge Services subscription

<Requirements />

- An active [Edge Services subscription](/edge-services/how-to/subscribe-edge-services/)
- [Deleted all your Edge Services pipelines](/edge-services/how-to/delete-pipeline/)

You can terminate your Edge Services subscription at any time, as long as you have deleted all your pipelines. You will be charged pro rata for the month you cancel, based on how much of that month your subscription was active.

3. Scroll down to the **Terminate subscription** section, and click **Terminate subscription**. 

    A pop-up displays, asking you to confirm that you want to terminate your subscription.

4. Type **DELETE** in the box, and click **Terminate** to confirm.

    Your Edge Services subscription is terminated. You can subscribe again at any time.
