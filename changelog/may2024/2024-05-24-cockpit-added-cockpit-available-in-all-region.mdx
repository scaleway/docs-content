Cockpit is now available in all three Scaleway regions: Paris, Amsterdam, and Warsaw. From the Scaleway console, you can now decide in which region to enable the [alert manager](/cockpit/concepts/#alert-manager) and your [preconfigured alerts](/cockpit/concepts/#preconfigured-alerts). You can also choose the regions in which to create your [data types](/cockpit/concepts/#data-types), [data sources](/cockpit/concepts/#data-sources), and [tokens](/cockpit/concepts/#cockpit-tokens).
