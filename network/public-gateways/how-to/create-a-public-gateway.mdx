This page shows how to create a [Public Gateway](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#public-gateway). Public Gateways sit at the border of Private Networks and provide extra functionality. They provide services to automate the allocation of private IP addresses ([DHCP](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#dhcp)), and deal with traffic entering and exiting the network ([NAT](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#nat)). You can add a Public Gateway to each of your Private Networks.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 
    - Choose an **Availability Zone**, which is the geographical location in which your Public Gateway will be created. Note that in order to attach a Public Gateway to a Private Network, they must be in the same Availability Zone.
    - Choose a **Public Gateway Type**, which impacts the pricing and bandwidth of your gateway.
    - Choose an **IP**. You can choose to assign one of your existing flexible IPs to your Public Gateway. Otherwise, a new IP will be automatically assigned here. 
    - Choose **Name** for your Public Gateway, and (optionally) a description and tags.
    - Verify the **Estimated Cost** of your Public Gateway, based on the specifications you chose.
4. Click **Create Public Gateway** to finish. 

    Your Public Gateway is created and you are redirected to the **Public Gateways** dashboard, where your newly-created Public Gateway now displays.
