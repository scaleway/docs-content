Scaleway is a complete cloud ecosystem, offering a single way for you to create, deploy and scale your infrastructure in the cloud. Creating your Scaleway account gives you access to the [Scaleway console](/console/account/concepts/#console) and [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/), and you can deploy our products and services with ease.

## How to create an account

<Macro id="create-account" />

## How to create resources

Once you have validated your payment method, you can start ordering resources like Instances, Kubernetes Kapsule, Object Storage and more. Find out more about [how to add resources to your Projects](/console/project/how-to/add-resources-project/).

## How to delete your account

Every account has an associated Organization, which in turn has an Owner. If you created your account (and never joined another Organization), you are the Owner of the Organization associated with your account. You can therefore use the **Deactivate Organization** button to permanently delete your account and all of its services and backups.

<Message type="important">
  There is a delay of up to 10 days between the time your Organization is closed, and the time resources are effectively deleted. It is recommended to delete all your resources before you close your Organization. A deactivated Organization can be reactivated upon your request.
</Message>

1. Click **Organization** at the top-right of the console, then click **Organization**. The **Organization Account** page displays.
2. Click **Deactivate Organization** which displays at the bottom of the page, once you have read and agreed with the warning message.
3. Type **Deactivate** to confirm your decision. 
4. Select the reasons why you are deactivating your Organization. 
5. Click **Deactivate Organization** to deactivate your Organization.
