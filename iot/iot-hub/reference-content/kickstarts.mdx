## Overview

Kickstarts are Scaleway Instances which are spawned, installed and configured for you to test and showcase some typical IoT use cases.


Kickstarts are currently available for the following use cases:

- **Data visualization**: get data from your sensors, store them in a time-series database (InfluxDB), and visualize them using a dashboarding tool (Grafana). Learn more on [How to use Data Visualization kickstart](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/use-dataviz-kickstart/).
- **Logging**: get logs from your systems, store them in a centralized document database (ElasticSearch), and explore them using a friendly interface (Kibana). Learn more on [How to use Logging kickstart](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/use-logging-kickstart/)
- **Flow programming**: trigger simple application flows in a visual editor (NodeRED) by connecting functional boxes. Learn more on [How to use Flow Programming kickstart](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/use-flow-programming-kickstart/)
- **Function as a Service**: trigger your code upon receiving messages with a FaaS framework (Nuclio). Learn more on [How to use Function as a Service kickstart](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/use-faas-kickstart/)

<Message type="important">

  To use Kickstarts, you must allow insecure connections to your Device. This is required because even though Kickstarts connect as existing Devices, they cannot obtain a Device certificate.
