Multi-AZ Kubernetes Kapsule is a configuration where a managed Kubernetes cluster is distributed across multiple isolated Availability Zones (AZs) within a Scaleway region, enhancing the resilience and availability of applications. 
This configuration allows the system to withstand failures in one zone by replicating resources and workloads across multiple zones.

## Deploying the Kapsule Kubernetes cluster

Start by creating a multi-AZ cluster on `fr-par` region, in a dedicated VPC and Private Network, with three pools of nodes, one in `fr-par-1`, one in `fr-par-2` and one in `fr-par-3`, with two nodes each. The steps for achieving this via Terraform are as follows:

<Lightbox src="scaleway-k8s-kapsule-multi-az-1-v2.webp" alt="" size="large" />

1. Create a `main.tf` file that will contain the Terraform part of this project, and set the required providers and their versions

    ```
    terraform {
        required_providers {
            scaleway = {
                source  = "scaleway/scaleway"
                version = ">= 2.28.0"
            }
            kubernetes = {
                source  = "hashicorp/kubernetes"
                version = ">=2.23.0"
            }
            helm = {
                source  = "hashicorp/helm"
                version = "2.11.0"
            }
            local = {
                source  = "hashicorp/local"
                version = "2.4.0"
            }
            kubectl = {
                source  = "gavinbunney/kubectl"
                version = "1.14.0"
            }
        }
        required_version = ">= 1.0.0"
    }
    ```
2. Add the Scaleway provider and its configuration. Refer to the Scaleway Terraform provider documentation for more information on how to [configure the provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/scaleway/scaleway/latest/docs).
    ```
    provider "scaleway" {
        region  = "fr-par"
    }
    ```

3. Create a dedicated VPC and a Private Network where we will deploy the Kapsule cluster. VPC and Private Networks are region-wide, so you can use them to host a cluster spread across multiple Availability Zones.
    ```
    resource "scaleway_vpc" "vpc_multi_az" {
        name = "vpc-multi-az"
        tags = ["multi-az"]
    }

    resource "scaleway_vpc_private_network" "pn_multi_az" {
        name   = "pn-multi-az"
        vpc_id = scaleway_vpc.vpc_multi_az.id
        tags   = ["multi-az"]
    }
    ```

4. Add the Kapsule cluster and the three pools, each in a different Availability Zone but in the same Private Network, to effectively make the cluster multi-AZ.
    Refer to the Scaleway Terraform provider documentation for available [Kapsule parameters](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/scaleway/scaleway/latest/docs/resources/k8s_cluster).
    - `scaleway_k8s_cluster` requires no specific configuration for the multi-AZ mode.
    - The [pools configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/scaleway/scaleway/latest/docs/resources/k8s_pool) `scaleway_k8s_pool` will get a `zone` parameter that allows placing each one in a different Availability Zone.
    ```
    resource "scaleway_k8s_cluster" "kapsule_multi_az" {
        name        = "kapsule-multi-az"
        tags        = ["multi-az"]

        type    = "kapsule"
        version = "1.28"
        cni     = "cilium"

        delete_additional_resources = true

        autoscaler_config {
            ignore_daemonsets_utilization = true
            balance_similar_node_groups   = true
        }

        auto_upgrade {
            enable                        = true
            maintenance_window_day        = "sunday"
            maintenance_window_start_hour = 2
        }

        private_network_id = scaleway_vpc_private_network.pn_multi_az.id
    }

    output "kapsule" {
        description = "Kapsule cluster id"
        value = scaleway_k8s_cluster.kapsule_multi_az.id
    }

    resource "scaleway_k8s_pool" "pool-multi-az" {
        for_each = {
            "fr-par-1" = "PRO2-XXS",
            "fr-par-2" = "PRO2-XXS",
            "fr-par-3" = "PRO2-XXS"
        }

        name                   = "pool-${each.key}"
        zone                   = each.key
        tags                   = ["multi-az"]
        cluster_id             = scaleway_k8s_cluster.kapsule_multi_az.id
        node_type              = each.value
        size                   = 2
        min_size               = 2
        max_size               = 3
        autoscaling            = true
        autohealing            = true
        container_runtime      = "containerd"
        root_volume_size_in_gb = 32
    }
    ```

5. Initialize your Terraform configuration and apply it to create your resources.
    ```
    terraform init
    terraform apply
    ```

6. Use the CLI to retrieve the `kubeconfig` file, which contains the address of the cluster and the credentials, then use it to access the cluster:
    ```
    terraform output kapsule
    "fr-par/[CLUSTER-ID]"

    scw k8s kubeconfig install [CLUSTER-ID]
    kubectl config use-context [CONTEXT]
    ```

7. List your nodes now to check that your cluster is ready, and that there are two nodes per Availability Zone.
    ```
    kubectl get nodes

    NAME                                             STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
    scw-kapsule-multi-az-pool-fr-par-1-61e22198f8c   Ready    <none>   89s   v1.28.0
    scw-kapsule-multi-az-pool-fr-par-1-8334e772ced   Ready    <none>   82s   v1.28.0
    scw-kapsule-multi-az-pool-fr-par-2-1bcf90f3683   Ready    <none>   90s   v1.28.0
    scw-kapsule-multi-az-pool-fr-par-2-33265e85597   Ready    <none>   86s   v1.28.0
    scw-kapsule-multi-az-pool-fr-par-3-44b14b7bbbd   Ready    <none>   84s   v1.28.0
    scw-kapsule-multi-az-pool-fr-par-3-863491657c7   Ready    <none>   80s   v1.28.0
    ```

## Nginx Ingress Controller as a stateless multi-AZ application

A very common pattern is to deploy an Ingress Controller to externally expose applications hosted inside the Kapsule cluster. Configuring a multi-AZ deployment of your Ingress Controller will greatly improve its resilience and scalability.

In this part, we will deploy an [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) in a multi-AZ, production ready configuration, using the previously created Kapsule cluster. The official Helm for the nginx controller is full-featured, so we will use it through the Terraform Helm provider.

<Message type="note">
    For this section you need, as a prerequisite, a domain managed on the Scaleway "Domains and DNS" service.
</Message>

The domain used for this tutorial can be of type `internal` when bought with your Scaleway account, or of the `external` type if you want to re-use a domain bought with an external DNS registrar. If you choose the `external` method, you can follow the [How to add an external domain to DNS](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/network/domains-and-dns/how-to/add-external-domain/) documentation. If you don't want to delegate all your domain to your Scaleway account, import your domain, but do not change the name servers in your registrar. Then you can create a "DNS zone" in Scaleway on your external domain, and declare two NS records in your registrar matching this zone. For example, with a domain "your-domain.tld" imported in Scaleway, you can create a DNS zone "scw", and delegate this zone in your registrar by adding those two records:
    ```
    scw 600 IN NS ns0.dom.scw.cloud.
    scw 600 IN NS ns1.dom.scw.cloud.
    ```
The zone "scw.your-domain.tld" is now managed in your Scaleway account.

1. Create a new file `ingress-nginx.tf` to store the deployment configuration of your ingress controller. The first step is to configure `kubectl` and `helm` providers to use the host and credentials generated by the `scaleway_k8s_cluster` resource when we created the Kapsule cluster.
    <Message type="tip">
      You can download the complete [`ingress-nginx.tf` configuration file](https://github.com/scaleway/kapsule-terraform-multi-az-tutorial/blob/main/main.tf) used in this tutorial from GitHub.
    </Message>
    ```
    provider "kubernetes" {
        host                   = scaleway_k8s_cluster.kapsule_multi_az.kubeconfig[0].host
        token                  = scaleway_k8s_cluster.kapsule_multi_az.kubeconfig[0].token
        cluster_ca_certificate = base64decode(scaleway_k8s_cluster.kapsule_multi_az.kubeconfig[0].cluster_ca_certificate)
    }

    provider "kubectl" {
        host                   = scaleway_k8s_cluster.kapsule_multi_az.kubeconfig[0].host
        token                  = scaleway_k8s_cluster.kapsule_multi_az.kubeconfig[0].token
        cluster_ca_certificate = base64decode(scaleway_k8s_cluster.kapsule_multi_az.kubeconfig[0].cluster_ca_certificate)
        load_config_file       = false
    }

    provider "helm" {
        kubernetes {
            host                   = scaleway_k8s_cluster.kapsule_multi_az.kubeconfig[0].host
            token                  = scaleway_k8s_cluster.kapsule_multi_az.kubeconfig[0].token
            cluster_ca_certificate = base64decode(scaleway_k8s_cluster.kapsule_multi_az.kubeconfig[0].cluster_ca_certificate)
        }
    }
    ```

2. Use the `kubectl` command below to get the label list of a node. We will use label sets on nodes to configure the distribution of the pods on the cluster. You can see that multiple labels, sets by the `scaleway-cloud-controller-manager`, contain information about the `region` and `zone` where the node is deployed. The label `topology.kubernetes.io/zone`, at the end of the list, is particularly interesting in your case as it will allow us to know on which availability zone a pod will be deployed.
    ```
    kubectl get node scw-kapsule-multi-az-pool-fr-par-1-51c432554c4 \
        --template '{{range $k, $v := .metadata.labels}}{{printf "%s=%s\n" $k $v}}{{end}}'

    beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64
    beta.kubernetes.io/instance-type=PRO2-XXS
    beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux
    failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region=fr-par
    failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone=fr-par-1
    k8s.scaleway.com/kapsule=6ee0a129-ee3b-4a89-ad4b-a74754441746
    k8s.scaleway.com/managed=true
    k8s.scaleway.com/multi-az=
    k8s.scaleway.com/node=51c43255-4c42-449a-9e63-d734c357cd65

    k8s.scaleway.com/pool-name=pool-fr-par-1
    k8s.scaleway.com/runtime=containerd
    kubernetes.io/arch=amd64
    kubernetes.io/hostname=scw-kapsule-multi-az-pool-fr-par-1-51c432554c4
    kubernetes.io/os=linux
    node.kubernetes.io/instance-type=PRO2-XXS
    topology.csi.scaleway.com/zone=fr-par-1
    topology.kubernetes.io/region=fr-par
    topology.kubernetes.io/zone=fr-par-1
    ```

3. Ensure you have at least two `ingress-nginx` pods per Availability Zone. To do so, set `replicaCount` to `6`. However, this alone won't guarantee distribution across zones. To that end, use `topologySpreadConstraints` to instruct the Kubernetes scheduler to distribute replicas based on the `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` label, which can have values like `fr-par-1`, `fr-par-2`, or `fr-par-3`. You can find detailed documentation for [Pod Topology Spread Constraints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/topology-spread-constraints/) in the Kubernetes documentation. Also there's an anti affinity to prevent the `ingress-nginx` pod to be scheduled on the same node in each AZ.
Then, disable the default Kubernetes service creation by the Helm chart as it we will be created through Terraform later on to have multiple `LoadBalancers`.
    ```
    resource "helm_release" "nginx_ingress" {
        name      = "ingress-nginx"
        namespace = "ingress-nginx"

        create_namespace = true

        repository = "https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx"
        chart      = "ingress-nginx"

        values = [
            <<-EOT
            controller:
              replicaCount: 6

              topologySpreadConstraints:
                - topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
                  maxSkew: 1
                  whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
                  labelSelector:
                    matchLabels:
                      app.kubernetes.io/name: ingress-nginx
                      app.kubernetes.io/instance: ingress-nginx
                      app.kubernetes.io/component: controller
              affinity:
                podAntiAffinity:
                  requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
                  - labelSelector:
                      matchLabels:
                        app.kubernetes.io/name: ingress-nginx
                        app.kubernetes.io/instance: ingress-nginx
                        app.kubernetes.io/component: controller
                    topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
              service:
                enabled: false
            EOT
        ]
    }
    ```

4. Add Kubernetes services of type `LoadBalancer` to expose your `ingress-nginx` pods. The important part here is that we will use the `service.beta.kubernetes.io/scw-loadbalancer-zone` annotation to create one load balancer per AZ. This annotation is used by the `scaleway-cloud-controller-manager` to create a load balancer in a specific AZ. In the `fr-par` region, load balancers are available in two AZs, so we will have two load balancers. Each load balancer dispatches traffic to the healthy nodes of all the AZs. This means, in case of the loss of one AZ where one of the two load balancers is located, the other load balancer will still be available and will dispatch traffic to the healthy nodes, and their healthy `ingress-nginx` pods, on the other AZs.
The selector matches the labels set by the Helm chart on the ingress-nginx pods, and the service exposes both HTTP and HTTPS ports. At the end of the resource, we tell Terraform to ignore some labels and annotations that the `scaleway-cloud-controller-manager` sets automatically, and that we do not want to override on the next Terraform runs.
    ```
    resource "kubernetes_service" "nginx" {
        for_each = toset(["fr-par-1", "fr-par-2"])

        metadata {
            name      = "ingress-nginx-controller-${each.key}"
            namespace = helm_release.nginx_ingress.namespace

            annotations = {
                "service.beta.kubernetes.io/scw-loadbalancer-zone" : each.key
            }
        }

        spec {
            selector = {
                "app.kubernetes.io/name"      = "ingress-nginx"
                "app.kubernetes.io/instance"  = "ingress-nginx"
                "app.kubernetes.io/component" = "controller"
            }

            port {
                app_protocol = "http"
                name         = "http"
                port         = 80
                protocol     = "TCP"
                target_port  = "http"
            }

            port {
                app_protocol = "https"
                name         = "https"
                port         = 443
                protocol     = "TCP"
                target_port  = "https"
            }

            type = "LoadBalancer"
        }

        lifecycle {
            ignore_changes = [
                metadata[0].annotations["service.beta.kubernetes.io/scw-loadbalancer-id"],
                metadata[0].labels["k8s.scaleway.com/cluster"],
                metadata[0].labels["k8s.scaleway.com/kapsule"],
                metadata[0].labels["k8s.scaleway.com/managed-by-scaleway-cloud-controller-manager"],
            ]
        }
    }
    ```

5. Add the creation of a DNS record to direct the external traffic to the available load balancers. We assume that you have an internal or external domain configured in your account with a `scw` zone, as described in the prerequisites part at the beginning of this section. In the code below, we use `your-domain.tld` as placeholder, so you need to replace it with your domain name. If you want to use a bare-domain, remove the subdomain parameter from the `scaleway_domain_zone` resource.
In this configuration we use the `http_service` block to check that the `ingress-nginx` service is up and running via each load balancer on the two AZs. We retrieve the IPs of the LoadBalancers via the "EXTERNAL-IP" exposed by the Kubernetes services. The DNS record "ingress" under your domain `scw.your-domain.tld` will resolve to all the IPs of the healthy load balancers, via the "all" strategy. So in case of the loss of one AZ, the DNS record will automatically be updated to resolve only to the IP of the healthy load balancer, and the traffic will be dispatched to the healthy nodes of the other AZs.
<Message type="important">
  The host used in the "url" must not match any ingress host defined in the cluster, otherwise the "/healthz" endpoint will not work.
</Message>
    ```
    data "scaleway_domain_zone" "multi_az" {
        domain    = "your-domain.tld"
        subdomain = "scw"
    }

    resource "scaleway_domain_record" "multi_az" {
        dns_zone = data.scaleway_domain_zone.multi_az.id
        name     = "ingress"
        type     = "A"
        data     = kubernetes_service.nginx["fr-par-1"].status[0].load_balancer[0].ingress[0].ip
        ttl      = 60

        http_service {
            ips = [
                kubernetes_service.nginx["fr-par-1"].status[0].load_balancer[0].ingress[0].ip,
                kubernetes_service.nginx["fr-par-2"].status[0].load_balancer[0].ingress[0].ip,
            ]
            must_contain = ""
            url          = "http://ingress.scw.yourdomain.tld/healthz"
            user_agent   = "scw_dns_healthcheck"
            strategy     = "all"
        }
    }
    ```

6. Apply your configuration and wait for the deployment to be ready.
    ```
    terraform apply
    ```

7. Check that your nginx deployment is running and that the pods are distributed across the different node pools in the different AZs.
    ```
    kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx -o wide

    ```

8. Check that both services of type LoadBalancer are up and get their external IPs.
    ```
    kubectl get services -n ingress-nginx 

    NAME                                 TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                      AGE
    ingress-nginx-controller-admission   ClusterIP      10.42.12.8     <none>          443/TCP                      31m
    ingress-nginx-controller-fr-par-1    LoadBalancer   10.41.26.168   195.154.68.56   80:32429/TCP,443:30842/TCP   14m
    ingress-nginx-controller-fr-par-2    LoadBalancer   10.42.96.9     51.159.85.96    80:30490/TCP,443:31351/TCP   14m
    ```

9. Using your browser or curl command, check that `ingress-nginx` is available. Since there is no ingress configured for the moment, it should respond with a 404 status code.
    ```
    curl http://195.154.68.56

    <html>
    <head><title>404 Not Found</title></head>
    <body>
    <center><h1>404 Not Found</h1></center>
    <hr><center>nginx</center>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

10. With `dig` command, check that your DNS record is resolving to the IPs of all of the healthy load balancers
    ```
    dig @ns1.dom.scw.cloud ingress.scw.your-domain.tld

    ...
    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    ingress.scw.your-domain.tld. 60 IN    A       195.154.68.56
    ingress.scw.your-domain.tld. 60 IN    A       51.159.85.96
    ...
    ```

Your multi-AZ Ingress Nginx Controller should now available on `http://ingress.scw.your-domain.tld`

To automatically manage TLS certificates for your HTTPS ingresses, you can [deploy the cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/).

## Elasticsearch/Kibana as a stateful multi-AZ application

In this last section, you will deploy a multi-AZ Elasticsearch and a Kibana instance to query it. It will allow you to work with the stateful constraints imposed by the use of persistent volumes in a multi-AZ architecture. As a prerequisite, you need to have a default `scw-bssd` storage class with a `volumeBindingMode` set to `WaitForFirstConsumer`. You can check your cluster with the `kubectl` command below. Previous clusters were provisioned with the binding mode set to `Immediate`, so if you are in this case you need to update your cluster to the latest patch version (kubernetes >=1.24.17, >=1.25.13, >=1.26.8, >=1.27.5 or >=1.28.1). The storage class will be automatically updated to the new binding mode during the update.
    ```
    kubectl get storageclasses.storage.k8s.io

    NAME                 PROVISIONER        RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE      ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE
    scw-bssd (default)   csi.scaleway.com   Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   true                   131m
    scw-bssd-retain      csi.scaleway.com   Retain          WaitForFirstConsumer   true                   131m
    ```

It is important to use a storage class with the `volumeBindingMode` option set to `WaitForFirstConsumer` when deploying a multi-AZ application with persistent volumes. 
  This option ensures the volume is created only when the pod is scheduled on a node, addressing the specific AZ requirement. Creating the volume before scheduling the pod could result in the volume being placed randomly in an AZ, potentially causing attachment failures if the pod is scheduled in a different AZ. 
  With the `WaitForFirstConsumer` option, volumes are created on the same AZ as the node where the pod is scheduled, effectively spreading volumes across different AZs as pods are distributed.

1. Create a new Terraform file `elasticsearch.tf` for this section. Deploying a clustered application commonly implies a more complex deployment logic. For Elasticsearch and Kibana, this logic is managed by ECK, the Elasticsearch operator for Kubernetes. It will be in charge of creating Elasticsearch nodes and configuring them to make a cluster. It will also automatically configure Kibana to connect to the Elasticsearch cluster. So the first thing to do is to deploy the ECK operator using its chart with the Helm provider.
    <Message type="tip">
      You can download the complete [`elasticsearch.tf` configuration file](https://github.com/scaleway/kapsule-terraform-multi-az-tutorial/blob/main/main.tf) used in this tutorial from GitHub.
    </Message>
    ```
    resource "helm_release" "eck" {
        name      = "elastic-operator"
        namespace = "elastic-system"

        create_namespace = true

        repository = "https://helm.elastic.co"
        chart      = "eck-operator"

        depends_on = [helm_release.nginx_ingress]
    }
    ```
2. Create a namespace to deploy your Elasticsearch cluster and Kibana instance. We use the `depends_on` parameter to make sure that the namespace is created after the ECK operator, so the Elasticsearch and Kibana CRDs are available before we try to create them.
    ```
        resource "kubernetes_namespace" "elasticsearch" {
        metadata {
            name = "elasticsearch"
        }

        depends_on = [helm_release.eck]
    }
    ```

3. Create your multi-AZ Elasticsearch cluster using the "Elasticsearch" CRD provided by the ECK operator.
    * Deploy an Elasticsearch cluster using `nodeSets`, consisting of three Elasticsearch nodes, one in each AZ.  These nodes will have persistent volumes to store data.
    * Now set the `storageClassName` to `scw-bssd`. This choice ensures that Elasticsearch volumes are correctly created in the respective AZs.
    * Then add the annotation `eck.k8s.elastic.co/downward-node-labels`. This annotation instructs the operator to assign the label `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` to each pod it creates. This label serves as an environment variable to set the `node.attr.zone` parameter on each Elasticsearch node. This step enables Elasticsearch to allocate primary and replica shards to pods in different AZs and nodes.
    * Finally, configure `topologySpreadConstraints` to distribute pods across AZs based on the `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` label defined on the nodes by Kapsule. For instance, if there are three node pools, each in a different AZ, and a nodeset `count` of 3, this configuration will ensure one pod per AZ. This redundancy ensures that even if one AZ experiences a failure, two pods will continue to run in the other AZs, maintaining the necessary quorum of 2 nodes needed to elect a master node and keeping the Elasticsearch cluster available.
    ```
    resource "kubectl_manifest" "elasticsearch" {
      yaml_body = <<YAML
    apiVersion: "elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/v1"
    kind: "Elasticsearch"
    metadata:
      name: "multi-az"
      namespace: "${kubernetes_namespace.elasticsearch.metadata[0].name}"
      annotations:
        "eck.k8s.elastic.co/downward-node-labels": "topology.kubernetes.io/zone"
    spec:
      version: "8.10.2"
      nodeSets:
      - name: "default"
        count: 3
        volumeClaimTemplates:
        - metadata:
            name: "elasticsearch-data"
          spec:
            accessModes:
            - "ReadWriteOnce"
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: "1Gi"
            storageClassName: "scw-bssd"
        config:
          node.attr.zone: "$${ZONE}"
          cluster.routing.allocation.awareness.attributes: "k8s_node_name,zone"
          node.store.allow_mmap: false
        podTemplate:
          spec:
            containers:
            - name: "elasticsearch"
              env:
              - name: "ZONE"
                valueFrom:
                  fieldRef:
                    fieldPath: "metadata.annotations['topology.kubernetes.io/zone']"
            topologySpreadConstraints:
            - maxSkew: 1
              topologyKey: "topology.kubernetes.io/zone"
              whenUnsatisfiable: "DoNotSchedule"
              labelSelector:
                matchLabels:
                  "elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/cluster-name": "multi-az"
                  "elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/statefulset-name": "multi-az-es-default"
    YAML
    }
    ```
4. Deploy a Kibana instance, which will be automatically configured to connect to the Elasticsearch cluster. We use the same `topologySpreadConstraints` as for Elasticsearch to spread the pods across the different AZs. We also use the `eck.k8s.elastic.co/cluster-name` annotation to tell the operator to connect this Kibana instance to the Elasticsearch cluster named "multi-az" created before.
    ```
    resource "kubectl_manifest" "kibana" {
      yaml_body = <<YAML
    apiVersion: "kibana.k8s.elastic.co/v1"
    kind: "Kibana"
    metadata:
      name: "kibana"
      namespace: "${kubernetes_namespace.elasticsearch.metadata[0].name}"
    spec:
      version: "8.10.2"
      count: 3
      elasticsearchRef:
        name: "multi-az"
      http:
        tls:
          selfSignedCertificate:
            disabled: true
    YAML
    }
    ```

5. To expose Kibana to the outside world, create an Ingress resource that matches the host `kibana.scw.your-domain.tld` and redirect traffic to the Kibana service. Once applied, it will allow you to access Kibana on https://kibana.scw.your-domain.tld using your browser.
    ```
    resource "kubernetes_ingress_v1" "kibana" {
      metadata {
        name      = "kibana"
        namespace = kubernetes_namespace.elasticsearch.metadata[0].name
      }
    
      spec {
        ingress_class_name = "nginx"
        rule {
          host = "kibana.scw.your-domain.tld"
          http {
            path {
              backend {
                service {
                  name = "kibana-kb-http"
                  port {
                    number = 5601
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

6. Create a DNS CNAME record for `kibana.scw.your-domain.tld`, pointing to the A record of your ingress-nginx controller deployed in the second section. Since this A record ,`ingress.scw.your-domain.tld`, is configured with health checks, it will automatically resolve to the IPs of the available load balancers, so in case of the loss of one AZ, the DNS record will automatically resolve to the IP of the healthy load balancer and the traffic will be dispatched to the healthy nodes of the other AZs, maintaining the availability of Kibana.
    ```
    resource "scaleway_domain_record" "kibana" {
      dns_zone        = data.scaleway_domain_zone.multi_az.id
      name            = "kibana"
      type            = "CNAME"
      data            = "ingress.scw.your-domain.tld."
      ttl             = 300
      keep_empty_zone = true
    }
    ```

7. Apply your configuration and wait for the deployments of Elasticsearch and Kibana to be ready.
    ```
    terraform apply
    ```

8. Check that the pods of your Elasticsearch cluster are spread across the different AZs, that your Elasticsarch cluster is healthy and that Kibana is ready.
    ```
    kubectl get pods -n elasticsearch -o wide

    NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP             NODE                                             NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES

    multi-az-es-default-1   1/1     Running   0          2m40s   100.64.2.30    scw-kapsule-multi-az-pool-fr-par-2-1bcf90f3683   <none>           <none>
    multi-az-es-default-2   1/1     Running   0          2m40s   100.64.4.74    scw-kapsule-multi-az-pool-fr-par-3-44b14b7bbbd   <none>           <none>

    kubectl get es

    NAME       HEALTH   NODES   VERSION   PHASE   AGE
    multi-az   green    3       8.10.2    Ready   2m48s

    kubectl get kibana

    NAME     HEALTH   NODES   VERSION   AGE
    kibana   green    3       8.10.2    2m52s
    ```

9. To access Kibana, open the URL `http://kibana.scw.your-domain.tld` in your browser. You should see the Kibana login page. The default username is `elastic` and the password is the one generated by the ECK operator. You can retrieve it with the command below.
    ```
    kubectl get secret multi-az-es-elastic-user -o jsonpath='{.data.elastic}' -n elasticsearch | base64 --decode

    <your-elastic-user-password>
    ```

You have finished this tutorial, and have a full production ready multi-AZ Kapsule cluster with a multi-AZ Ingress Controller and a multi-AZ Elasticsearch/Kibana cluster. You can now deploy your applications based on the same logic and enjoy the high availability of your Kubernetes cluster.
