## Cyberduck - Overview

Object Storage allows you to store any kind of object (documents, images, videos, etc.) and retrieve them at a later time from anywhere.

For instance, you can store images and they will be accessible using HTTP.
You can use the control panel to manage your storage. Some tools exist to interact with Object Storage.

## Configuring Cyberduck

1. To use Cyberduck with Object Storage, you need to import a configuration file. Copy & paste the following code into a file where the `region`, `hostname` and `description` are updated with your values `scaleway.cyberduckprofile`:
    ```xml
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
    <plist version="1.0">
        <dict>
            <key>Protocol</key>
            <string>s3</string>
            <key>Vendor</key>
            <string>poc</string>
            <key>Description</key>
            <string>s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud</string>
            <key>Default Hostname</key>
            <string>s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud</string>
            <key>Default Port</key>
            <string>443</string>
            <key>Username Placeholder</key>
            <string>Access Key</string>
            <key>Password Placeholder</key>
            <string>Secret Key</string>
            <key>Authorization</key>
            <string>AWS4HMACSHA256</string>
            <key>Region</key>
            <string>nl-ams</string>
            <key>Regions</key>
            <array>
                <string>nl-ams</string>
            </array>
        </dict>
    </plist>
    ```
    <Message type="important">
      Edit the `region` parameter to the region of your bucket. It can either be `fr-par` (Paris, France), `nl-ams` (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) or `pl-waw`(Warsaw, Poland).
    </Message>
2. Save the file and double click it to open Cyberduck.
3. Fill `<Access Key ID>` with your access key and `<Secret Key ID>` with your Secret key.
