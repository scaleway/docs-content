Installing an SMTP relay that sends messages from your servers allows you to be notified if/when there are problems, as the server tends to report them by email.

Additionally, this enables software installed on the server to use the SMTP relay instead of dealing with potentially complicated configurations for sending emails directly.


In this tutorial, you will learn how to configure [Postfix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postfix_(software)) and send emails via Transactional Email's SMTP service. For the sake of this tutorial, we are using MacOS.

## Configuring Postfix with submission

1. Open a terminal and access the `sasl_passwd` file within Postfix, using the following command:

    ```bash
    nano /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
    ```
2. Copy and paste the following content into the `sasl_passwd` file.

    ```bash
    [smtp.tem.scw.cloud]:587 <$SCW_USERNAME>:<$SCW_SECRET_KEY>
    ```
3. Replace `<$SCW_USERNAME>` with your username that displays in the **Overview** tab of your domain, in the SMTP configuration section.
4. Replace `<$SCW_SECRET_KEY>` with your API's secret key.
5. Type `CTRL O` and press `Enter` to save, then type `CTRL X` to exit the file.
6. Access the `main.cf` file to configure Postfix:
    ```bash
    nano /etc/postfix/main.cf
    ```
7. Add the following lines at the end of the `main.cf` file. Make sure you replace `<your-domain-name>` with your own domain name and set the `relayhost` to `[smtp.tem.scw.cloud]:587`.

    ```bash
    smtpd_banner = $myhostname ESMTP $mail_name
    biff = no
    append_dot_mydomain = no
    myorigin = <your-domain-name>
    delay_warning_time = 4
    alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases
    alias_database = hash:/etc/aliases
    mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost
    smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
    smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
    smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
    smtp_use_tls = yes
    relayhost = [smtp.tem.scw.cloud]:587
    mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8
    inet_interfaces = loopback-only
    smtpd_relay_restrictions = permit_mynetworks,defer_unauth_destination,reject
    ```
8. Type `CTRL O` and press `Enter` to save, then type `CTRL X` to exit the file.
9. Use the following command to launch Postmap:
    ```bash
    postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
    ```
    <Message type="tip">
     Depending on your configuration, you might need to use `sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd` to be able to launch Postmap.
    </Message>
10. Relaunch Postfix using the following command:
    ```bash
    sudo postfix reload
    ```
11. Use the following command to send an email. Make sure that you replace `<your-domain>` with your own domain and `recipient@recipient.com` with your recipient's email address.
    ```bash
    date | mail -s "Test from postfix" -a "From:<you@your-domain>" recipient@recipient.com
    ```

    <Message type="important">
    Keep in mind that the **subject**, **body** and **HTML** of your emails must have **at least 10 characters**.
    </Message>
12. Optionally, use `mailq` to see if your mail has been sent. An empty mail queue means that your email has been sent.

## Configuring Postfix with a TLS port

Some providers do not let you access port 587. To solve this issue, Scaleway offers non-standard ports that are unlikely to be blocked: `2587` (SMTP) and `2465` (TLS). A workaround is to use stunnel to be able to use Postfix.

1. Open a terminal and access the `smtp-wrapper.conf` file using the following command:
    ```bash
    nano /etc/stunnel/smtp-wrapper.conf
    ```
2. Copy the following configuration and paste it into the `smtp-wrapper.conf` file:
    ```bash
    [smtp-tls-wrapper]
    accept = 2465
    client = yes
    connect = smtp.tem.scw.cloud:2465
    ```
3. Type `CTRL O` and press `Enter` to save, then type `CTRL X` to exit the file.
4. Start `stunnel` by running the following command:
    ```
    stunnel /etc/stunnel/smtp-wrapper.conf
    ```
5. Open a new terminal and access your `sasl_passwd` file within Postfix using the following command:
    ```bash
    nano /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
    ```
5. Copy the following configuration and paste it in your file:
    ```bash
    [localhost]:2465 <$SCW_USERNAME>:<$SCW_SECRET_KEY>
    ```
6. Replace `<SCW_USERNAME>` with your username that displays in the **Overview** tab of your domain, in the SMTP configuration section.
7. Replace `<$SCW_SECRET_KEY>` with your API's secret key.
8. Type `CTRL O` and press `Enter` to save, then type `CTRL X` to exit the file.
9. Access your `main.cf` file using the following command:
    ```bash
    nano /etc/postfix/main.cf
    ```
8. Replace `relayhost = [smtp.tem.scw.cloud]:587` with `relayhost = [localhost]:2465`.
9. Type `CTRL O` and press `Enter` to save, then type `CTRL X` to exit the file.
10. Use the following command to launch Postmap:
    ```bash
    postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
    ```
    <Message type="tip">
     Depending on your configuration, you might need to use `sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd` to be able to launch Postmap.
