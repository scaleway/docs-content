Scaleway Object Storage automatically sends detailed logs and metrics to [Scaleway Cockpit](/cockpit/) for monitoring, observability, and auditing purposes.

To find out how to consult your Object Storage metrics and logs, refer to the [dedicated documentation](/object-storage/how-to/monitor-consumption/). 

## Metrics collected by Cockpit

Cockpit collects the following metrics for each Object Storage bucket:

| Metric Name                                      | Description                                                                 | Unit   | Refresh Frequency |
|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------------|
| `object_storage_bucket_objects_total`           | Total number of objects currently stored in the bucket.                     | Objects  | 1 hour         |
| `object_storage_bucket_usage_bytes_total`       | Total storage space used by all objects in the bucket, in bytes.            | Bytes  | 1 hour         |
| `object_storage_bucket_parts_total`             | Total number of multipart upload parts present in the bucket.               | Parts  | 1 hour          |
| `object_storage_bucket_bandwidth_egress_bytes`  | Total number of bytes sent from the bucket to clients (outbound traffic).   | KB/MB per day  | 1 minute          |
| `object_storage_bucket_bandwidth_ingress_bytes` | Total number of bytes received by the bucket from clients (inbound traffic).| KB/MB per day  | 1 minute          |
| `object_storage_bucket_http_response_time_seconds_bucket` | Distribution of HTTP response times for bucket operations. | s/ms | 1 minute    |
| `object_storage_bucket_http_response_time_seconds_count` | Total count of HTTP responses for bucket operations.                  | min/s/ms  | 1 minute          |
| `object_storage_bucket_http_response_time_seconds_sum`    | Cumulative sum of HTTP response times for bucket operations.          | s/ms  | 1 minute        |

## Logs collected by Cockpit

Cockpit collects the following logs for each request received by Object Storage buckets:

- `@timestamp`: The exact time when the log entry was recorded.
- `s3_call`: The specific S3 API operation performed (e.g., GetObject, PutObject).
- `project_id`: The ProjectID associated with the request.
- `URI`: The URI path of the HTTP request made to the bucket.
- `http_method`: The HTTP method used for the request (e.g., GET, PUT, DELETE).
- `http_status_code`: The HTTP status code returned in response to the request.
- `http_host`: The value of the HTTP Host header in the request.
- `bucket`: The name of the bucket targeted by the request.
- `txid`: The unique transaction ID assigned to the request.
- `source_ip`: The source IP address from which the request originated.
