Kubernetes Kapsule and Kosmos support NVIDIA's official Kubernetes operator for all GPU pools.
This operator is compatible with [RENDER-S](https://www.scaleway.com/en/gpu-instances/), [GPU-3070-S](https://www.scaleway.com/en/gpu-3070-instances/), [H100 PCIe](https://www.scaleway.com/en/h100-pcie-try-it-now/), [L40s](https://www.scaleway.com/en/l40s-gpu-instance/) and [L4](https://www.scaleway.com/en/l4-gpu-instance/) offers.

The GPU operator is set up for all GPU pools created in Kubernetes Kapsule and Kosmos, providing automated installation of all required software on GPU worker nodes, such as the device plugin, container toolkit, GPU drivers etc. For more information, refer to [the GPU operator overview](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/overview.html).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created a [Kubernetes Kapsule or Kosmos cluster](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/)

## How to get the GPU operator for a new pool?

Scaleway uses Helm to automate the deployment of the GPU operator in your GPU node pools. It is installed by default on every GPU pools.

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the Containers section of the side menu. The Kubernetes creation page displays.
2. Select the cluster you want to add a pool to.
3. Click the **Pools** tab.
4. Click the **+ Add pool** button. The pool creation wizard displays.
5. If you are using a **Kosmos** cluster, you can optionally choose a **pool type**. Select a Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule pool.
6. Choose the zone in which your pool will be deployed.
7. Click the **GPU** tab and select the GPU Instance you want to add.
8. Configure the pool options for your pool.
9. Click **Add pool** to deploy the pool. The GPU operator displays in the Easy Deploy tab of your pool and your `kube-system` namespace.

## How to activate the GPU operator on existing node pools

Replace the existing nodes of your pool to deploy the GPU operator on your existing pools.

<Message type="important">
    The GPU Operator installs the drivers shortly *after* node creation.
</Message>
Note that if your workload immediately schedules on it, it will miss essential components.
Preferably, add a Kubernetes selector on your workload.
```
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    nvidia.com/gpu.present: true
```
or specific hardware requirements
```
spec:
  containers:
    - name: gpu-workload
      image: "rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/my-namespace/gpu-image:v1.0"
      resources:
        limits:
          nvidia.com/gpu: 1
```

## How to edit the configuration of the GPU operator

The GPU operator on your Scaleway node pools is fully configurable through the Easy Deploy feature, directly from the Scaleway console, or by using `helm`.

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the Containers section of the side menu. The Kubernetes creation page displays.
2. Select the cluster you want to configure.
3. Click the **Easy Deploy** tab.
4. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Edit** next to the GPU operator deployment. A pop-up displays.
5. Edit the YAML configuration of the deployment to match your desired configuration.
    <Message type="tip">
        Refer to the [offical NVIDIA documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/getting-started.html#chart-customization-options) for a list of available Helm configuration options.

6. Click **Update and deploy** to update and deploy the configuration of the GPU operator.
