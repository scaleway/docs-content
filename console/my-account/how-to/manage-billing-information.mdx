      - When you register a new credit card, an authorization charge is debited from your account. An **Authorization Charge** is a dummy transaction made to check the validity of the card. 
      - The authorization charge is of **1€** and will carry a 4-digit validation code, displayed on your bank account statement. This validation code will be used to verify your credit card for your Scaleway account. You will be refunded for the 1€ within 48h to 72h.
