This page shows you how to set up [SPF](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#spf-record) and [DKIM](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#dkim-record) records to your domain to verify it.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/).
  - You have a domain name.
  - You have [configured your domain with Transactional Email](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/configure-domain-with-transactional-email).
</Message>


After you have configured your domain with Transactional Email, you are prompted to verify your domain by adding SPF, DKIM and [MX records](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/add-mx-record-to-your-domain/). You can choose to do so right after you have validated your domain, or at a later time.


1. Click **Transactional Email** in the **Managed Services** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. Your newly-added domain displays.
2. Click your domain. You are redirected to the SPF, DKIM and MX configuration page.
3. Copy the value that applies to your case to add an SPF record.
    <Message type="important">
     - If you have no SPF record on this domain, copy the following value: `v=spf1 include:_spf.scw-tem.cloud -all`
     - If you already have configured an SPF record, copy the following value: `include:_spf.scw-tem.cloud`
    </Message>

11. Check the box "I have added these DNS records to my DNS zone" to confirm.
