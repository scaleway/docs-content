Penpot is an open-source design and prototyping platform designed for cross-domain teams. It is completely web based and works with open web standards (SVG). Penpot can run in almost any modern browser, regardless of the underlying operating system.

In this tutorial you learn how to deploy your own Penpot Instance using the Docker [InstantApp](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/tutorials/docker-instantapp/).

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />
 
## Installing Penpot using Docker Compose 

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) side menu. Then [deploy](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) a new Instance using the [Docker InstantApp](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers/create?area=fr-par-1&imageKey=c1b530d8-0ca0-45c4-80db-ba06608287b2&offerName=PLAY2-MICRO).

2. Connect to the Instance using [SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/): 
    ```
    ssh root@<docker_instance_ip>
    ```

3. Download the Docker configuration from the Penpot repository:

    ```
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/penpot/penpot/main/docker/images/docker-compose.yaml
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/penpot/penpot/main/docker/images/config.env
    ```

4. Open the file containing the environment variables (`config.env`) in a text editor:
    ```
    nano config.env
    ```

5. Set the `PENPOT_PUBLIC_URI` to your Penpot domain. Then save the file and exit the editor.
    ```
    PENPOT_PUBLIC_URI=https://penpot.mydomain.eu
    ```
6. Update the APT package cache on your system to make sure you have the latest releases available.
    ```
    apt update
    ```

7. Install the Nginx web server and `certbot` using APT. These serve as a frontend for the Penpot application and provide a secured TLS connection by using Let's Encrypt certificates.
    ```
    apt install nginx python3-certbot-nginx
    ```

8. Disable the default virtual host, that is pre-configured when Nginx is installed via Ubuntu’s package manager.
    ```
    unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
    ```

9. Create a Nginx configuration file for the reverse proxy:
    ```
    nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/penpot.conf
    ```

    Copy the following content into the file, save it and exit the editor.
    ```
    server {
            listen 80;
            listen [::]:80;

            server_name  penpot.mydomain.eu;

            access_log /var/log/nginx/reverse-access.log;
            error_log /var/log/nginx/reverse-error.log;

            location / {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9001/;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
            proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forward-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forward-Proto http;
            proxy_set_header X-Nginx-Proxy true;
            proxy_redirect off;
        }
    }
    ```
10. Link the configuration file to enable it with Nginx.
    ```
    ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/penpot.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/penpot.conf
    ```
11. Reload Nginx to activate the new configuration:
    ```
    service nginx reload
    ```

## Securing the connection using TLS

1. Run `certbot`, a tool that automatizes most of the configuration work related with requesting, installing and managing the TLS certificate:
    ```
    certbot --nginx
    ```
2. Answer the prompts that display on the screen to request a valid Let’s Encrypt TLS certificate:
    ```
    Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
    Plugins selected: Authenticator nginx, Installer nginx

## Running Penpot 

1. Run `docker-compose` to start Penpot:
    ```
    docker-compose -p penpot -f docker-compose.yaml up -d
    ```
2. Run the following command to add a Penpot user:
    ```
    docker exec -ti penpot-penpot-backend-1 ./manage.sh create-profile
    ```
3. Open a web browser on your local computer and point it to your Penpot domain. The login screen displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-penpot-login.webp" alt="" />
4. Log in using the credentials of the previously created user. The Penpot dashboard displays. You can now start designing your assets.
