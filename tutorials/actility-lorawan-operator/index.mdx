LoRaWAN© stands out as a low-power, low-bandwidth, long-range radio protocol, ideal for wirelessly transmitting data from numerous devices. It is tailored for battery-operated gadgets, requiring minimal installation expenses.

These devices relay data to accessible LoRaWAN© gateways, which then pass on the information through the LoRaWAN© operator network. In our context, Scaleway IoT Hub serves as the designated **LoRaWAN© application**.

[Actility](https://www.actility.com), an established LoRaWAN© operator, offers the capability to construct either public or private LoRaWAN© networks.

This tutorial will guide you through:

- Establishing an IoT Hub to manage communication with LoRaWAN© devices.
- Incorporating a device into the Hub to facilitate the Actility-to-Scaleway connection.
- Configuring the Actility backend to use device credentials for establishing a connection with the IoT Hub.
- Introducing another device and linking it as a subscriber to receive LoRaWAN© messages.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Actility Thingpark Enterprise console](https://community.thingpark.io/).
  - Your SSH key has been [properly configured](/console/project/how-to/create-ssh-key/).
  - You have created an [IoT Hub](/managed-services/iot-hub/how-to/create-hub).
  - You have [added](/managed-services/iot-hub/how-to/add-device) a device to your IoT Hub with the **Deny Insecure** option enabled.
</Message>

## Configuring the Actility backend

1. Navigate to the [Actility Thingpark Enterprise console](https://community.thingpark.io/).
2. Select **Applications > Create** and opt for MQTT.
3. Fill in the required parameters (unlisted settings can be customized):
    - **Hostname**: Enter your IoT Hub endpoint, followed by the MQTT port (e.g., `iot.fr-par.scw.cloud:8883`).
    - **Account prefix**: Specify `my-app` to set the MQTT topic prefix, leading to messages published under a topic like `<prefix>/things/<LoRaWAN device ID>/uplink`.
    - **Protocol**: Choose `SSL`.
    - **MQTT Username**: Input your IoT Hub device ID.
    - **MQTT Password**: Leave this field blank.
    - **Certificate**: Attach the device certificate file (e.g., `my-device-crt.pem`).
    - **Private Key**: Provide the device key file (e.g., `my-device-key.pem`).
4. Save your settings.
5. Ensure the **Deployment Status** reflects **Opened** in the application page to confirm the application's operational status.

Your LoRaWAN© network is now seamlessly integrated with your IoT Hub.

## Subscribing to LoRaWAN© device messages

To ensure a smooth flow of messages, create a new device dedicated to subscribing to LoRaWAN© device messages.

1. Create another IoT Hub device, now enabling the **Allow Insecure** connections setting since secured connections are incompatible with Web Sockets, used by the **MQTT Webclient**.
2. Access the **MQTT Webclient** via the device page. The client will automatically open and connect.
3. Follow the instructions below to subscribe to LoRaWAN© device messages:
    - Click **Add New Topic Subscription** within the **Subscriptions** block.
    - Choose a color for identification.
    - Maintain QoS 0.
    - Use `my-app/things/+/uplink` as the topic. This allows the IoT Hub to forward uplink messages from all devices.
    - Click **Subscribe**.

Your subscription will now be visible in the **Subscriptions** block, with messages from your LoRa devices appearing in the **Messages** block.

## Setting up a dashboard

Extend your capabilities by harnessing IoT Hub to construct a dashboard and visualize your data effortlessly:

1. [Create a Database Instance](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/create-a-database/) for PostgreSQL, add a `lora` table with fields such as `time` (timestamp type) and `data` (jsonb type).
2. Configure a [Database route](/managed-services/iot-hub/api-cli/cli-db-tips-tricks) to push data into the database. Set the topic filter as: `my-app/things/+/uplink`. Your query will resemble:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO lora (time, data) VALUES (NOW(), $PAYLOAD)
    ```
3. [Create an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance) and configure Grafana (Follow steps 1 to 14 of the tutorial, excluding enabling the TimescaleDB option).
4. Enhance your dashboard with widgets.
5. Experiment with creating a graph using the following query:
    ```sql
    SELECT time, data->'DevEUI_uplink'->'payload'->'batteryLevel' as batteryLevel FROM lora WHERE $__timeFilter(time)
    ```

Your dashboard will now provide insightful visualizations of your LoRaWAN© device data.
