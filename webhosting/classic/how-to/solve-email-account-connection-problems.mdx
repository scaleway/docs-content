    - Some email clients cut the domain part of your email address in the username by default. For example with the email address “[firstname.lastname@example.com](mailto:firstname.lastname@example.com)”, your client cuts it to “firstname.lastname”. Make sure to enter your complete email address as your username.

4. Verify your username and make sure to use your entire email address (for example "[firstname.lastname@example.com](mailto:firstname.lastname@example.com)").
