import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'


<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created a [Kubernetes Kapsule cluster](/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/)

To refine the instructions for clarity and completeness:

1. Access the **Containers** section from the sidebar menu within the [Scaleway console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements), then select **Kubernetes**. The Kubernetes Kapsule dashboard displays.
2. From the drop-down menu, select the geographical region you want to manage.
3. Locate the cluster you intend to delete, and click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to it. From the drop-down menu, select **Delete**. This will prompt a pop-up for cluster deletion.
4. In the deletion pop-up, input **DELETE** to confirm the deletion of your cluster. Ensure to check the box to automatically remove all volumes (including those labeled with volume type “retain”) and Load Balancers whose names commence with the cluster ID. Once confirmed, proceed by clicking **Delete cluster**.
   <Message type="important">
     Note: Deleting your cluster will irreversibly remove the cluster along with all associated pools and instances.
   </Message>

Upon completion, your cluster and its associated resources will be permanently removed. You can recreate a new cluster at any time.
