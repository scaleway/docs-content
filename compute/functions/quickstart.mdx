The Scaleway [Elements Functions platform](https://www.scaleway.com/en/serverless-functions/) makes your functions available, executes them on demand and manages resource allocation for you. A function is a lightweight unit of logic, defining a procedure for changing one element into another. The function remains static, while the variables that pass through it can vary. We show you how to create a functions namespace, create your function, and delete when no longer needed.

## How to create a functions namespace

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.

2. Click **Create a namespace**. The functions namespace creation wizard displays.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 

    - Enter a **name** and optionally a **description** for your namespace. The name must only contain alphanumeric characters.
    - Choose a **region**, which is the geographical location in which your namespace will be deployed.
    - (Optionally) Enter any **environment variables** required for your namespace. Environment variables configured in a namespace will be available in all functions/apps within the same namespace. For each environment variable, click **+Add** and enter the key/value pair.

4. Click **Create a namespace** to finish.

Your namespace is now created and you are taken to its **Functions** tab.

## How to create a function

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.

2. Click the functions namespace you want to use to create your function. 

3. Click **Create a Function**. The function creation wizard displays.

4. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 

    - Enter your **function code**. 
      - From the first drop-down menu, choose to either use the inline code editor to edit your code directly from your browser in the box provided, or to upload a `*.zip` archive.
      - From the second drop-down menu, choose your desired runtime, e.g. `node16`, `node18`, `python37`, `python310` or `go118`.
      - From the third drop-down menu, set the Handler for your function
    - Choose a **name** for your function, and optionally a **description**. The name must only contain alphanumeric characters.
    - Choose the **resources** to be allocated to your function at runtime. These define the performance characteristics of your function.
    - Set your **scaling** preferences, or leave them at default values. The Scaleway platform autoscales the number of available instances of your function to match the incoming load, depending on the settings you define here.
    - Define any **environment variables** you want to inject into your function. For each environment variable, click **+Add** and enter the key/value pair.
    - Set the desired **privacy policy** for your function. This defines whether a function can be executed anonymously (**public**) or only via an authentication mechanism provided by Scaleway (**private**). 
    - Optionally, use the **advanced options** to add [triggers](/compute/functions/concepts/#trigger) to your function deployment. Adding triggers enables the function to handle events coming from sources other than an HTTP endpoint, such as CRON (time-based jobs).
    - Verify the **estimated cost**.

5. Click **Create a function** to finish.

## How to delete a function

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.

2. Click the relevant functions namespace.

2. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the function you want to delete, and select **Delete** from the dropdown menu. 

3. Type **DELETE** in the pop-up that asks you to confirm the action, then click **Delete this function**.

  You can also delete a function from the [Function settings tab](/compute/functions/how-to/manage-a-functions-namespace/).
