## Abuse

[Abuse](https://www.scaleway.com/en/abuse-notice/) of Scaleway services includes cyber-crime, copyright violation, illegal or offensive content, spamming and malware distribution. Abuse should be [reported in the console](https://console.scaleway.com/support/abuses/create).

</Concept>

## Active session

An active session begins when a computer or device signs into your account. To connect you to your account, Scaleway uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT). JWT allows secure transmission of information between parties through tokens. These parties can be users, servers, or any other combination of services. In the case of Scaleway, when a user connects to their account (e.g. via an email address and password), we generate a token, associate it with the session and send it to the user. The token is composed of a header, a payload, and a signature. You can see the list of your active sessions in the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/account/user/profile), to get an overview of all devices that are signed in and recently active on your account.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## API Key

An API key is a unique identifier associated with each Scaleway [project](#project). It is used to authenticate requests made to the [Scaleway API](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/). An API Key consists of an [Access Key](/console/my-project/concepts/#access-key) and a [Secret Key](/console/my-project/concepts/#secret-key).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Billing Alert

The Billing Alerts feature allows you to keep track of your billing costs. When you activate this feature, you define a monthly **budget**, in Euros, and an alert **threshold**, which is a percentage of this monthly budget. When your Scaleway billing reaches this threshold (eg 70% of your monthly budget), an alert is sent to you by SMS, e-mail or API webhook.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Console

The Scaleway Console allows you to view and manage your Scaleway products, billing information, support tickets and more. You can access the console at the  following address: [console.scaleway.com](https://console.scaleway.com/organization).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Credentials

Credentials are unique to each [project](#project), and consist of unique and secure identifiers to authenticate your connections and commands to your Scaleway products. Credentials include [SSH Keys](#ssh-key) and [API Keys](#api-key).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Default project

Each [Organization](#organization) must have at least one associated [Project](#project), and at the time of account creation this project is called **default**. The default project takes on the Organization ID. Therefore, the default status cannot be transferred to other projects, nor can the default project's name be altered.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## KYC

**K**now **Y**our **C**ustomer is the process of verifying a client's identity. An ID document such as a passport, driver's license or identity card is required to  [complete KYC verification](/console/my-account/how-to/verify-identity/).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Login information

Consists of the **e-mail address** your account is registered to and its corresponding **password**. With your login information, you can connect to your Scaleway Organization via the Scaleway console. As an alternative to using a password, you can use login using a [magic link](#magic-link).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## MAC Address

A **M**edia **A**ccess **C**ontrol Address is a unique ID assigned to network interface cards (NICs), used to ensure the physical address of a computer. It identifies the hardware manufacturer and is used for network communication between devices in a network segment.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Magic Link

A magic link provides quick and secure access to your account without the hassle of remembering your [password](#login-information). When you choose to sign in with Magic Link, you receive a unique link sent directly to your email inbox which you can use one time only to authenticate your login. Afterward, it automatically becomes invalid.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Members

Members are people who are part of an [Organization](#organization). Members can have different [roles](#roles) which define their permissions and access rights. Organization members and roles can be [easily managed from the console](/console/my-project/how-to/manage-organization-members/).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

MFA is an authentication method which allows you to easily secure your Scaleway Organizations. MFA requires you to provide two or more verification factors to access your resources, ensuring different levels of security.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Organization

Organizations is Scaleway's Multi-User feature. Every Scaleway account has an associated Organization. An Organization is a resource system, with hierarchically organized accesses and permissions. An Organization can have one or more associated [projects](#project): the Organization is the root account of each of its Projects. Organizations can have one or more [members](#members) with different [roles](#roles). Organizations allow you to centrally manage and share resources across multiple accounts depending on the permissions granted by the [owner](#owner).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Organization Dashboard

The Organization Dashboard is the display you see when you log in to [console.scaleway.com](https://console.scaleway.com/). On this dashboard you can see the name of your [Organization](#organization), and depending on your [role](#roles), an overview of your resources and a breakdown of your resource consumption and billing. As you add and use resources, the Organization Dashboard stays up to date.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Organization Quotas

Every [Organization](#organization) has quotas, which are limits on the number of Scaleway resources they can use. Quotas are per product (eg Instances) and product type (eg GP1-L instance). Quotas are designed to prevent abuse, and can be viewed on the [Organization Account page](https://console.scaleway.com/account/organization/profile) of the console.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Project

Project is Scaleway's resource management feature. Designed to help you organize your infrastructure and cloud services, the feature allows resources to be isolated and grouped into specific projects. Each project has its own [credentials](#credentials). Each Organization has at least one project, called the [default project](#default-project). You can [create additional projects](/console/my-project/how-to/create-a-project/) as well.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Roles

A role is a set of permissions and access rights available to [members](#members) of an [Organization](#organization). Four roles are available: [Owner](/console/my-project/concepts/#owner), [Administrator](/console/my-project/concepts/#administrator), [Editor](/console/my-project/concepts/#editor) and 
[Billing Administrator](/console/my-project/concepts/#billing-administrator).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## SSH Key

An SSH Key (**S**ecure **Sh**ell Key) allows passwordless connection to an [Instance](/compute/instances/concepts/#instance). An SSH Key is [generated by creating an RSA key pair](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/), consisting of two elements:

- a sensitive **identification key**, (aka private key) which must be stored securely
- a **public key** which is uploaded to the Scaleway interface.

The public key is kept in your Scaleway account and transferred to the instance during the boot process, while the identification key is kept securely on your local computer. When connecting to the instance via SSH, a trusted connection to the machine is established using the key pair.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Support plan

Scaleway provides four different types of [support plan](https://console.scaleway.com/support/plans): Basic, Bronze, Silver and Gold. Your support plan determines the level of service and dedicated assistance you have access to, and the guaranteed response time of your support requests. You can [configure your support plan in the console](/console/my-account/how-to/configure-support-plans/).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Multifactor authentication

Multifactor authentication (MFA) is any form of verification that requires two factors to authenticate to something. Scaleway supports MFA for Cloud accounts in the form of a security code that you use in addition to your password when you log in. You can receive the code via SMS or an authenticator app on your smartphone. Enabling MFA adds an additional layer of security against unauthorized access to your account.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## UUID

A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) is a 128-bit label attributed by Scaleway to each resource, used to identify them in CLI and API operations. UUIDs can also identify users and Organizations, as well as cloud resources.

</Concept>
