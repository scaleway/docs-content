MongoDB is a document-oriented database that is free and open-source. It considered one of the most popular NoSQL database engines because it is scalable, powerful, reliable and easy to use.
In contrast to relational database, MongoDB does not require a deep predefined schema before you can add data since it can be altered at any time. As it uses the NoSQL concept, data rows are stored in JSON-like documents which allows arbitrary data to be inserted.

## Setting up MongoDB

### Adding MongoDB Repository

	
<Message type="important">

  You should always use the official MongoDB `mongodb-org` packages, which are kept up-to-date with the most recent major and minor MongoDB releases.

</Message>

1. [Connect to your instance](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/) via SSH.

  ```
  ssh root@your.instance.ip.address
  ```

  If you do not know your server IP, you can list your existing servers using `scw ps` (Scaleway CLI). Type `yes` or `y` when prompted to confirm that we wish to proceed. If the Scaleway CLI is not installed, you have several options:

    - (Preferred) On Mac OS using Homebrew and launching `brew install scw`
    - On Mac OS using a manual install

  ```
  Install the latest stable release on Mac OS X manually:
  # prepare for first install and upgrade
  mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
  mv /usr/local/bin/scw /tmp/scw.old
  # get latest release
  wget "https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/releases/download/v1.19/scw-darwin-amd64" -O /usr/local/bin/scw
  # test
  scw version
  Install the latest release on Linux:
  # get latest release
  export ARCH=amd64  # can be 'i386', 'amd64' or 'armhf'
  wget "https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/releases/download/v1.19/scw_1.19_${ARCH}.deb" -O /tmp/scw.deb
  dpkg -i /tmp/scw.deb && rm -f /tmp/scw.deb
  # test
  scw version
  ```

    - On Windows by downloading the [.exe](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/releases/download/v1.19/scw-windows-amd64.exe)

  <Message type="important">

    If you use the root user, you can remove the `sudo` before each command.

  </Message> 

2. Update Ubuntu package manager

  ```
  sudo apt-get update
  ```

3. Upgrade the Ubuntu packages already installed

  ```
  sudo apt-get upgrade
  ```

4. Import the key for the official MongoDB repository (Ubuntu ensures the authenticity of software packages by verifying that they are signed with GPG keys.)

  ```
  sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 0C49F3730359A14518585931BC711F9BA15703C6
  ```
  ```
  Executing: /tmp/tmp.68PpBponrV/gpg.1.sh --keyserver
  hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80
  --recv
  0C49F3730359A14518585931BC711F9BA15703C6
  gpg: requesting key A15703C6 from hkp server keyserver.ubuntu.com
  gpg: key A15703C6: public key "MongoDB 3.4 Release Signing Key <packaging@mongodb.com>" imported
  gpg: Total number processed: 1
  gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)
  ```

5. Add the MongoDB repository details so that Ubuntu's `apt` command-line tool will know where to download the packages. Execute the following command to create a list file for MongoDB.

  ```
  echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] http://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu xenial/mongodb-org/3.4 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.4.list
  ```

6. Update the packages list

  ```
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
  ```

### Installing MongoDB

1. Install the `mongodb-org` meta-package, which includes the daemon, configuration and init scripts, shell, and management tools on the server.

  ```
  sudo apt-get install mongodb-org
  ```

2. Press enter or type `Y` to proceed when prompted. Once the installation is completed, we start the MongoDB daemon

  ```
  sudo systemctl start mongod
  ```

3. Since `systemctl` does not provide output, verify that the service has started properly.

  ```
  sudo systemctl status mongod
  ```
  ```
  mongod.service - High-performance, schema-free document-oriented database
    Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/mongod.service; disabled; vendor preset:
    Active: active (running) since Wed 2018-xx-yy 13:04:39 UTC; 1min 52s ago
      Docs: https://docs.mongodb.org/manual
  Main PID: 25081 (mongod)
    CGroup: /system.slice/mongod.service
            └─25081 /usr/bin/mongod --config /etc/mongod.conf
  ```

  Press `q` to exit.

4. Ensure that it restarts automatically at each boot

  ```
  sudo systemctl enable mongod
  ```
  ```
  Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/mongod.service to /lib/systemd/system/mongod.service.
  ```

### Securing MongoDB

The default installation of MongoDB is vulnerable because no authentication is required to interact with the database. Any user could create and destroy databases, as well as read from and write to their contents by default. To secure MongoDB, we need to create an administrative user and enable authentication.

1. Connect to the Mongo shell to add a new user

  ```
  mongo
  ```
  ```
  MongoDB shell version v3.4.15
  connecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
  MongoDB server version: 3.4.15
  Server has startup warnings:
  2018-06-27T13:04:39.592+0000 I STORAGE  [initandlisten]
  2018-06-27T13:04:39.592+0000 I STORAGE  [initandlisten] ** WARNING: Using the XFS filesystem is strongly recommended with the WiredTiger storage engine

  2018-06-27T13:04:39.706+0000 I CONTROL  [initandlisten]
  2018-06-27T13:04:39.706+0000 I CONTROL  [initandlisten]
  2018-06-27T13:04:39.706+0000 I CONTROL  [initandlisten] ** WARNING: /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag is 'always'.
  2018-06-27T13:04:39.706+0000 I CONTROL  [initandlisten] **        We suggest setting it to 'never'
  2018-06-27T13:04:39.706+0000 I CONTROL  [initandlisten]
  ```

  You can choose any preferred name for the administrative user since the privilege level is assigned from the role of `userAdminAnyDatabase`.

  The `admin` database designates where the credentials are stored. You can learn more about authentication in the [MongoDB Security Authentication section](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/authentication/).

2. Set the username of your choice and be sure to pick your own secure password and substitute them in the command below:

  ```
  use admin
  db.createUser(
    {
      user: "AdminOce",
      pwd: "PWD2018AdminOce",
      roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" } ]
    }
  )
  ```
  ```
  use admin
  switched to db admin
  > db.createUser(
  ...   {
  ...     user: "AdminOce",
  ...     pwd: "PWD2018AdminOce",
  ...     roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" } ]
  ...   }
  ... )
  Successfully added user: {
    "user" : "AdminOce",
    "roles" : [
      {
        "role" : "userAdminAnyDatabase",
        "db" : "admin"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

3. Type `exit` and press ENTER or use `CTRL+C` to leave the client.

  ```
  > exit
  bye
  ```

### Enabling authentication

In order to enforce authentication, we need to enable authentication and restart the MongoDB daemon.

1. Open the configuration file

  ```
  sudo nano /etc/mongod.conf
  ```

2. In the `#security` section, remove the hash in front of security to enable the section. Then, we add the authorization lines (indented with two spaces) as per the following excerpt below:

  ```
  security:
  authorization: "enabled"
  ```

3. Restart the daemon

  ```
  sudo systemctl restart mongod
  ```

4. Check the status to verify that the service has rebooted

  ```
  sudo systemctl status mongod
  ```
  ```
  mongod.service - High-performance, schema-free document-oriented database
    Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/mongod.service; enabled; vendor preset: e
    Active: active (running) since Wed 2018-xx-yy 15:36:34 UTC; 2min 16s ago
      Docs: https://docs.mongodb.org/manual
  Main PID: 25593 (mongod)
    CGroup: /system.slice/mongod.service
            └─25593 /usr/bin/mongod --config /etc/mongod.conf
  ```

  Press `q` to exit.

5. Ensure that the daemon restarts automatically at boot

  ```
  sudo systemctl enable mongod
  ```

  If we see Active: `active (running)` in the output and it ends with something similar to the text below, the restart command was successful:

  ```
  Jun 27 15:36:34 mongoDB systemd[1]: Started High-performance, schema-free document-oriented database.
  ```

### Testing authentication

1. Connect without credentials to verify that our actions are restricted

  ```
  mongo
  ```
  ```
  MongoDB shell version v3.4.15
  connecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
  MongoDB server version: 3.4.15
  ```

  We are connected to the test database.

2. Test that the access is restricted with the `show dbs` command:

  ```
  show dbs
  2018-06-27T15:55:36.481+0000 E QUERY    [thread1] Error: listDatabases failed:{
    "ok" : 0,
    "errmsg" : "not authorized on admin to execute command { listDatabases: 1.0 }",
    "code" : 13,
    "codeName" : "Unauthorized"
  } :
  ```

3. Exit the shell to proceed

  ```
  > exit
  bye
  ```

### Verifying the administrative user's access

1. Connect as our administrator with the `-u` option to supply a username and `-p` to be prompted for a password. Supply the database where we stored the user's authentication credentials with the `--authenticationDatabase` option.

  ```
  mongo -u AdminOce -p --authenticationDatabase admin
  ```

2. Once the correct password is entered, we are dropped into the shell, where we can issue the `show dbs` command:

  ```
  MongoDB shell version v3.4.15
  Enter password:
  connecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
  MongoDB server version: 3.4.15
  > show dbs
  admin  0.000GB
  local  0.000GB
  ```

Type `exit` or press `CTRL+C` to exit.

## Configuring remote access (Optional) 

### Enabling UFW

Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW), is a front-end to iptables. Its main goal is to make managing your firewall drop-dead simple and to provide an easy-to-use interface.

<Message type="note">
 
  If UFW is already installed on your computer, go directly to step 5.
 
</Message> 

1. Install UFW.

  ```
  sudo apt-get install ufw
  ```

2. Check UFW status.

  ```
  sudo ufw status
  ```

3. Enable UFW, as it is probably inactive.

  ```
  sudo ufw enable
  ```

4. Ensure to allow SSH.

  ```
  sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
  ```

5. Rerun the UFW status command.

  ```
  sudo ufw status
  ```
  ```
  Status: active

  To                         Action      From
  --                         ------      ----
  OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
  OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
  ```

6. Allow access to the default MongoDB port `27017` but restrict that access to a specific host.

  ```
  sudo ufw allow from client_ip_address to any port 27017
  ```

7. Re-run this command using the IP address for each additional client that needs access. To double-check the rule, run `ufw status` again:

  ```
  sudo ufw status
  ```
  ```
  To                         Action      From
  --                         ------      ----
  OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
  27017                      ALLOW       client_ip_address
  OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
  ```

### Configuring a public bindIP

1. To allow remote connections, add our host's publically-routable IP address to the `mongod.conf` file.

  ```
  sudo nano /etc/mongod.conf
  ```

2. In the `net` section, add the MongoHost's IP to the bindIp line
  	
  <Message type="note">

    Verify your private IP with the `ifconfig` command.

  </Message> 

  ```
  net:
    port: 27017
    bindIp: 127.0.0.1,IP_of_MongoHost
  ```

3. Restart the daemon

  ```
  systemctl restart mongod
  ```

4. Check the daemon status

  ```
  systemctl status mongod
  ```
  ```
  Active: active (running) since Thu 2018-xx-yy 13:15:35 UTC; 5s ago
  ```

### Testing remote connections

Ensure that Mongo is listening on its public interface by adding the `--host` flag with the IP address from the `mongodb.conf file`.

  ```
  mongo -u AdminOce -p --authenticationDatabase admin --host IP_address_of_MongoHost
  ```

  ```
  MongoDB shell version v3.4.15
  Enter password:
  connecting to: mongodb://10.15.124.17:27017/
  MongoDB server version: 3.4.15
  ```

### Uninstalling MongoDB

<Message type="important">

  This process will completely remove MongoDB, its configuration, and all databases. This process is not reversible, so ensure that all of your configuration and data is backed up before proceeding.

</Message>

1. Stop MongoDB.

  ```
  sudo service mongod stop
  ```

2. Remove any MongoDB packages that you had previously installed.

  ```
  sudo apt-get purge mongodb-org*
  ```

3. Remove MongoDB databases and log files.

  ```
  sudo rm -r /var/log/mongodb
  sudo rm -r /var/lib/mongodb
  ```
