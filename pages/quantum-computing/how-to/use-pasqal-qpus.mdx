**Pasqal** is a full-stack quantum computing company based in France, pioneering the use of **Neutral Atoms** (manipulated by optical tweezers) to build quantum processors.

Their technology is fundamentally different from superconducting circuits. Instead of fixed wires, Pasqal uses lasers to hold individual atoms (Rubidium or Strontium) in 2D or 3D arrays. This allows for **arbitrary topology**: you can arrange the qubits (atoms) in any shape (triangle, square, honeycombs) to match the geometry of the problem you are trying to solve.

Pasqal processors operate primarily in **Analog Mode** (applying pulses to the whole system to evolve the Hamiltonian), making them exceptionally powerful for quantum simulation and combinatorial optimization.

## How to access Pasqal with Scaleway

The following example shows how to create a simple register, define a pulse, and send it to Fresnel QPU emulator.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account with a valid **Project ID**
- A Scaleway **API Key** (Secret Key)
- Python and [Pulser](https://pulser.readthedocs.io/) installed on your local machine

1. Install the `pulser-scaleway` provider. Refer to the [Pulser Scaleway GitHub repository](https://github.com/scaleway/pulser-scaleway) for more information.

    ```bash
    pip install pulser-scaleway
    ```

2. Create a file with the following computation script. Replace `$SCW_PROJECT_ID` and `$SCW_SECRET_KEY` with your Scaleway Project ID and secret key.


        ```python
        from pulser import Pulse, Sequence, Register
        from pulser_scaleway import ScalewayProvider

        # 1. Initiate provider
        qaas_connection = ScalewayProvider(
            project_id="$SCW_PROJECT_ID",
            secret_key="$SCW_SECRET_KEY",
        )

        # 2. Retrieve all QPU devices (emulated or real) and select the good one
        devices = qaas_connection.fetch_available_devices()
        fresnel_device = devices["EMU-FRESNEL-100PQ"]

        # 3. Create a register of trapped atoms before performing operation on them
        # and declare the sequence of pulses to perform on the register
        register = Register.square(5, 5).with_automatic_layout(fresnel_device)
        sequence = Sequence(register, fresnel_device)
        sequence.declare_channel("rydberg_global", "rydberg_global")
        t = sequence.declare_variable("t", dtype=int)

        amp_wf = BlackmanWaveform(t, np.pi)
        det_wf = RampWaveform(t, -5, 5)
        sequence.add(Pulse(amp_wf, det_wf, 0), "rydberg_global")

        # 4. Declare a backend based on the sequence and remote connection
        backend = QPUBackend(sequence=sequence, connection=qaas_connection)

        # 5. Run jobs with different arguments over the same sequence and register
        results = backend.run(
            job_params=[
                {"runs": 100, "variables": {"t": 1000}},
                {"runs": 20, "variables": {"t": 2000}},
            ],
            wait=True,
        )

        print("Results:", results)
        ```

4. Save the script. In this example we save it as `pasqal.py`.

5. Run the script.
    ```bash
    python ~/pasqal.py
    ```

    <Message type="note">
    While Pulser focuses on Analog computing (Pulses), it also supports a Digital mode to emulate gate-based circuits. However, Pasqal's hardware advantage lies primarily in the Analog approach for optimization problems (MIS, MaxCut). Refer to the [Pulser documentation](https://pulser.readthedocs.io/) for more information.
