Scaleway Serverless SQL Databases are fully managed databases that automatically scale both in storage and compute according to your workloads.

This page explains how to create, access and delete a Serverless SQL Database using the Scaleway console.

## How to create a database

1. Click **SQL Databases** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The Serverless SQL Databases page displays.

2. Click **+ Create database**. The database creation wizard displays.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:

  - Choose a **region**, which is the geographical location in which your database will be created.

  - Select a **default engine version** from the drop-down menu.

  - Configure your **database autoscaling**, or keep the default values. Your database will scale within the defined range to match the incoming load.

    <Message type="note">
        Define a minimum of 1 vCPU or more to avoid cold starts that can take a few seconds. 
    </Message>

    - Enter a **name** for your database, or keep the randomly-generated name. The name must only contain alphanumeric characters and dashes.

    - Verify the **estimated cost**.

4. Click **Create database** to finish. The setting up of your database will take a few seconds. Check the **Overview** tab to see its status.

## How to connect to a database

1. From the **Overview** tab of your database, click the **Set up credentials** button. The setup wizard displays.

2. Select yourself as the [principal](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#principal) to connect to the database.

    <Message type="note">
        Refer to the [IAM documentation](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/overview/) for more information on identities and access rights.

3. Set up the **Connection string**:

  - If you already have a secret key, paste it in the connection string in place of the `[INSERT_SECRET_KEY_HERE]` placeholder.

  - If you do not have a secret key, click **Generate new secret key**.

4. Copy your connection string and store it securely.

5. Run the following command in a terminal:

    ```bash
    psql "[YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING]"
    ```

An output similar to the following response displays:

    ```bash
    psql (15.3, server 14.8 (Debian 14.8-1pgsg120+1))
    SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, compression: off)
    Type "help" for help.
    ```

## How to delete a database

1. Click **SQL Databases** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The Serverless SQL Databases page displays.

2. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the database you want to delete, and select **Delete** from the dropdown menu. A pop-up displays.

3. Type **DELETE**, then click **Delete database**.

<Message type="tip">
    - You can also delete a database from its **Overview** tab.
    - You can delete several databases by selecting the appropriate items from the **SQL databases** section and clicking the <Icon mane="delete" /> icon.
