This page shows how to create and manage SNS [topics](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#topic) with Scaleway Messaging and Queuing.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [activated SNS](/serverless/messaging/how-to/get-started/#how-to-activate-sqs-or-sns)
</Message>

## How to create a topic

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of Messaging and Queuing protocols displays.

2. Click **SNS**, then navigate to the **Topics** tab and click **Create topic**. The topic creation wizard displays.

3. Choose a geographical **region** in which to create your SNS topic.

4. Enter a **name** for your topic. The name must contain no more than 80 characters, and consist only of alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. Alternatively, you can go with the auto-generated name suggested for you.

5. Choose a **topic type**, from one of the following:
    - **Standard**: Standard topics ensure at-least-once delivery. The exact order of messages published to the topic is not preserved.
    - **FIFO**: FIFO topics (**F**irst **In** **F**irst **O**ut) preserves the exact ordering of messages. [Content-based deduplication](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#content-based-deduplication) is only available for FIFO topics.

5. Configure your topics's **parameters**. The following parameters can be defined:
    - **Content-based deduplication**: This setting is only available for FIFO topics. Enable content based deduplication to ensure that identical messages are not processed or stored multiple times. You should only enable this setting if the message body is guaranteed to be unique for each message.

6. Click **Create topic** to finish.

You are returned to the **Topics** tab, where your newly-created topic now displays. The topic's URL is also displayed here, for use in your API/CLI operations. 

Go further by clicking on the topic's name to access its **Settings** page and see additional information such as its ARN (Amazon Resource Name) and configuration parameters.

<Message type="tip">
Remember that you need to [create credentials](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-credentials/) in order to access your SNS service and its topics from an API or CLI. Sending messages to topics requires that credentials have the `can_publish` permission, while receiving messages from topics requires the `can_receive` permission. You can create separate credentials if you need to isolate these two roles in your application.
</Message>

## How to modify a topic's configuration

You can modify the content-based deduplication setting for FIFO topics after creating the topic. However, you cannot change a topic's name or type after creation.

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of Messaging and Queuing protocols displays.

2. Click **SNS**, then navigate to the **Topics** tab and click the topic you wish to modify. The topic's **Settings** page displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-topic-settings.webp" alt="" />

3. Modify the content-based deduplication setting as you wish.

5. Click **Save**.


## How to delete a topic

When you no longer want a topic, you can delete it. This action is irreversible and deletes the topic along with all its associated subscriptions.

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of Messaging and Queuing protocols displays.

2. Click **SNS**, then navigate to the **Topics** tab and click the topic you wish to delete. The topic's **Settings** page displays.
    <Lightbox src="TODO" alt="" />

3. Either:
    - Click the topic you wish to delete. The topic's **Settings** page displays. Click the **Delete topic** button in the bottom right corner.
    - Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the topic you wish to delete, then select **Delete** from the menu that displays.

    A pop-up asks you to confirm that you understand this action will delete the topic and all of its associated subscriptions.

4. Type **DELETE** and click **Delete topic**.
