## Availability Zone 

An Availability Zone refers to the geographical location in which your Instance will be created. The latency between multiple AZs of the same region is low, as they have a common network layer. Find below the list of availability zones by region:

- France - Paris (`fr-par`)
  `fr-par-1`
  `fr-par-2`
- The Netherlands - Amsterdam (`nl-ams`)
  `nl-ams-1`
- Poland - Warsaw (`pl-waw`)
  `pl-waw-1`
=======
## Acknowledgement flag (ACKs)  

Are [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) flags used to indicate that a packet was received successfully.

## Allowed IPs

Access control list (ACL) rules [define permissions for remote access to a Database Instance](/databases/databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/manage-allowed-ip-addresses/). A rule consists of an IP address or an IP range.

## Cluster 

<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
A Redis™ cluster consists of a set of primary and secondary nodes. The cluster nodes use hash partitioning to split the keyspace into 16,384 key slots. Each primary of the cluster is responsible for a subset of those slots. Each secondary node replicates the data of one of the primary ones.

## Cluster mode

Each Databases for Redis™ cluster consists of minimum three and maximum six compute Instances hosting each a primary Redis™ Instance and a secondary Instance for one of the other nodes. If one of the primary nodes fails, the remaining nodes hold a vote and elect one of the remaining secondary nodes as the new primary node. When the failing node rejoins the cluster, it automatically becomes a secondary node and begins to replicate the data of another primary node.

## Endpoint

<<<<<<< HEAD

A point of connection to a database. The endpoint is associated with one or more public IPv4 addresses and a port or with a private IPv4 and port (if you use [Private Networks]).
=======
A point of connection to a database. The endpoint is associated with an IPv4 address and a port, and contains the information of whether the endpoint is read-write or not.

## High availability

High Availability is handled through the Redis™ clustering feature. This is a 3-node multi-master architecture. In case of downtime on a node in the cluster, a new node is able to take over the requests with minimal downtime.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Horizontal Scaling

A feature that allows you to increase the size of your Redis™ Database Instance infrastructure by adding more nodes to your Database Instance to increase your number of endpoints and distribute cache. 

</Concept>

<Concept>

## In-memory database 

A database management system primarily built upon memory. Data is managed and stored within the main memory of an Instance. This allows the optimization of request speed and the improvement of application performance. 

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Managed database

Compared to traditional database management, which requires customers to provision their own infrastructure and resources to manage their databases, managed databases offer the user access to a Database Instance without them needing to set up the hardware or configure the software.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Max Memory

A configuration directive used to set the maximum amount of memory Redis™ can use for a data set. You can set this value via the Scaleway console or by configuring the `available_settings` via API.

</Concept>

## Region

A region is represented as a Geographical area such as France (Paris: `fr-par`), the Netherlands (Amsterdam: `nl-ams`) or Poland (Warsaw: `pl-waw`).

## TCP Keep alive 

A packet that is sent by a device when the [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) connection on a routing device has been idle for too long. The packet is sent to the peer with only the [Acknowledgement flag (ACK)](#acknowledgement-flag-(acks)) turned on. 

</Concept>

<Concept>

## TLS 

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is an Internet security protocol that enables data to be securely exchanged over a network using in transit encryption.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Vertical scaling  

Feature that allows you to increase the size of your Redis™ Database Instance by upgrading to a bigger node type to allow increased traffic for the same endpoint.
