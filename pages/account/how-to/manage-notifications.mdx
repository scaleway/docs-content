The **notification manager** allows you to configure different types of notifications about Organization events, for the users in your Organization. These events include incidents, technical issues or maintenance, security alerts and billing. The notification manager also provides shortcuts to your [Budget alerts](/billing/how-to/use-billing-alerts/), [Cockpit alerts](/cockpit/how-to/enable-alert-manager/), and the Scaleway [status page](https://status.scaleway.com/).

## How to notify users in your Organization

1. Click the bell icon, or **notification manager** icon, in the top-right menu of the Scaleway console. You are directed to the Notification Manager page.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-notif-icon.webp" alt="" />
2. Scroll to the **User notifications** section.
3. Check the box(es) next to the email of the user for who you want to set up the notifications. Four [types of notifications](#types-of-notifications) are available: **Incident**, **Technical**, **Security** and **Billing**.
    <Message type="important">
      The emails displayed in the list belong to users in your Organization. To see them in the list, first you must have either [invited them as a Guest](/iam/how-to/invite-user-to-orga/), or [created a new Member](/iam/how-to/manage-members/#how-to-create-a-member).
    </Message>

When you check the box, the user is automatically subscribed to the notifications.

<Message type="note">
  You can uncheck the box(es) to unsubscribe a user from notifications.
</Message>

### Types of notifications

The notification manager lets you decide who receives each type of notification. Here are some examples of the different types of notifications:

| **Notification type** | **Examples**                                                 |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Incident              | Service downtime detected, outage resolved                   |
| Technical             | Scheduled maintenance, update required                       |
| Security              | Suspicious login attempt detected, MFA activated/deactivated |
| Billing               | New invoice sent, credit card expired                        |

## How to notify users outside of your Organization

You can set external contacts, ones that are not users in your Organization, to receive notifications.

1. Navigate to the **External notifications** section.
2. Click **Add Contact**.
3. Enter the contact’s **name** and select a **delivery method**.
    <Message type="important">
      Currently, only emails are available as a delivery method.
    </Message>
4. Click **Select notification type**.
5. Choose the [notifications](/account/how-to/manage-notifications/#types-of-notifications) the contact should receive (e.g., Incident, Billing).
6. Click **Add contact** to confirm.
