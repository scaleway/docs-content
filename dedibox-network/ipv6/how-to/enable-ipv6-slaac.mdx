Activation of IPv6 SLAAC (stateless auto-configuration of addresses) assigns **one** `/128` IPv6 subnet to your server (one usable IPv6 address). This IP will be statically linked to your server and can not be attributed to a another server.

<Message tyoe="note">

This feature is not yet available for all servers. Only the servers that are compatible will show the related button.

1. Click **Server** > **Server list** to display a list of all your servers.

2. Click **Manage** next to the server you want to configure. The server's status page displays.

3. Scroll down to the servers network section and click **Activate IPv6 SLAAC**:

Your server's IPv6 slaac is activated now and displays in the network section.

If required, you can disable your server's IPv6 SLAAC by clicking on the button **Disable IPv6 SLAAC**.
