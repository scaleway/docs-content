Scaleway Topics and Events is a message broker tool that allows you to transfer messages between different microservices and platforms. This enables them to "talk" to each other effectively even if they are not otherwise compatible. Topics and Events enable and simplify microservices application development and allows you to build highly scalable, reliable, distributed applications.

## Console overview
Discover the Topics and Events interface on the Scaleway console.

## How to create Topics and Events credentials

Credentials for Topics and Events are granular: you can define the level of access that they should give. Credentials give the specified level of access to all topics that you create in the region they are scoped to.

1. Click **Topics and Events** in the **Integration Services** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The **Topics and Events** dashboard displays.

2. Click the **Credentials** tab. 

3. Click **Generate credentials**. A pop-up displays:

    <Lightbox image={image} alt="In the Scaleway console, the Generate credentials screen displays. It prompts the user to choose a region for their credentials, a name, and permissions (write, read and/or manage)" />

4. Choose a region that these credentials should be scoped to.

5. Enter a name for these credentials.

6. Select the required permissions for the credentials. You must choose at least one of **Write**, **Read** and **Manage**. You are free to select any combination of these permissions.

7. Click **Generate credentials**.

    The credentials are created. The access key and secret key are displayed, and you are invited to copy them.
    
    <Message type="important">
      This is your only chance to view and save the secret key. Make sure that you copy it and save it somewhere securely.
    </Message>

8. Copy and save the credentials, before closing the window.

    You are returned to the **Credentials** tab. The name of your newly-generated credentials, along with the access key and access level are displayed.

## How to create topics

1. Click **Topics and Events** in the **Integration Services** section of the Scaleway console side menu. 

2. Click **Create topic**. The topic creation wizard displays.

    <Lightbox image={image2} alt="In the Scaleway console, the Create a Topic screen displays. The different sections of the screen are described in the steps below." />

3. Choose a region in which to create your topic.

4. Enter a **name** for your topic. The name must contain no more than 80 characters, and consist only of alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. Alternatively, you can go with the auto-generated name suggested for you.

5. Choose a **topic type**. The following topic types are available:
    -  **Standard**: Ensures at-least-once message delivery, where the order of messages is not preserved. Supports Serverless Functions, Serverless Containers and HTTP/S subscriptions. 
    - **FIFO**: Provides first-in-first-out delivery, where the order of messages is preserved without duplication. Supports Scaleway Queues subscriptions. [Content-based deduplication](/topics-and-events/concepts/#content-based-deduplication) is only available for FIFO topics.

6. Click **Create topic** to finish.

You are returned to the **Topics** tab, where your newly-created topic now displays. The topic's URL is also displayed here, for use in your API/CLI operations.

## How to create a subscription

1. Click **Topics and Events** in the **Integration Services** section of the Scaleway console side menu.

2. Use the dropdown menu to select the [region](/topics-and-events/concepts/#region) of the topic you want to create a subscription for.

3. Click the name of the topic you want to create a subscription for.

4. Click **Create Subscription**. The subscription creation wizard displays.
    <Lightbox image={image3} alt="In the Scaleway console, the Create a Subscription screen displays. The different sections of the screen are described in the steps below" />

5. Verify the parameters of the topic that you are creating a subscription for (name and type).

6. Choose a protocol, based on the type of endpoint or client you want to subscribe. Click the tab below for further details and full instructions on each protocol:

    <Tabs id="messaging-subscription-protocol">
        <TabsTab label="HTTP">
          <br />
          Select **HTTP** to create a subscription for a service or web server that can receive `HTTP POST` requests from Topics and Events, via standard HTTP protocol.

          Note that for security reasons, we recommend using the HTTPS protocol, rather than HTTP.

          You are prompted to enter the URL of the HTTP endpoint to subscribe, e.g. `example.com`. Note that the scheme (`http://`) is not required.

          After your HTTP subscription is created, you must confirm it. Find out how in our [dedicated documentation](/topics-and-events/how-to/create-manage-subscriptions/#how-to-confirm-an-http-or-https-subscription).

        </TabsTab>
        <TabsTab label="HTTPS">
          <br />
          Select **HTTPS** to create a subscription for a service or web server that can receive `HTTP POST` requests from Topics and Events, via secure HTTP protocol.

          You are prompted to enter the URL of the HTTP endpoint to subscribe, e.g. `example.com`. Note that the scheme (`https://`) is not required.

          After your HTTP subscription is created, you must confirm it. Find out how in our [dedicated documentation](/topics-and-events/how-to/create-manage-subscriptions/#how-to-confirm-an-http-or-https-subscription).
        </TabsTab>
        <TabsTab label="Serverless Functions and Containers">
          <br />
          Choose **Serverless Functions and Containers** to create a subscription for a Scaleway Serverless Function or Container that you have created.

          You are prompted to select the **namespace** containing the Function or Container that you want to subscribe. Only namespaces in the same [Project](/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project) and [region](/topics-and-events/concepts/#region) as the topic can be selected.

          You are prompted to select the Serverless Function or Container to subscribe. Only Functions and Containers with a public [privacy policy](/serverless-functions/concepts/#privacy-policy) can subscribe to a topic.
        </TabsTab>
        <TabsTab label="Queues">
          <br />

          Choose **Queues** to create a subscription for a Scaleway queue that you have created.

          You are prompted to select the **queue** to subscribe. Only queues in the same [Project](/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project) and [region](/topics-and-events/concepts/#region) as the topic can be selected.
        </TabsTab>
    </Tabs>

7. Click **Create subscription** to finish.

    The subscription is created. If you created an HTTP or HTTPS subscription, you will now need to [confirm it](/topics-and-events/how-to/create-manage-subscriptions/#how-to-confirm-an-http-or-https-subscription).

## How to publish messages

All further actions related to publishing messages to topics can be done via a supported CLI or SDK. See our documentation on the [SNS CLI and SDKs](/topics-and-events/reference-content/topics-and-events-overview#further-actions)for more information.

## How to delete a topic

When you no longer want a topic, you can delete it. This action is irreversible and deletes the topic along with all its associated subscriptions.

1. Click **Topics and Events** in the **Integration Services** section of the Scaleway console side menu. 

2. Use the drop-down menu to select the [region](/topics-and-events/concepts/#region) containing the topic you want to delete.

3. Either:
    - Click the topic you wish to delete, and navigate to its **Settings** page. Click the **Delete topic** button in the bottom right corner, or
    - Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the topic you wish to delete, then select **Delete** from the menu that displays.

    A pop-up asks you to confirm that you understand this action will delete the topic and all of its associated subscriptions.

4. Type **DELETE** and click **Delete topic**.
