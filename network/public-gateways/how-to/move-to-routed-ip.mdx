Public Gateways have a [public flexible IP address ](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#flexible-ip) which makes the Public Gateway accessible over the internet. Internally at Scaleway, these IP addresses have so far been implemented via a NAT (Network Address Translation) solution. Going forward, we are moving to a more efficient routed IP solution.

You can move your Public Gateway from NAT to routed IP addressing by following the simple steps outlined on this page. **Your IP address itself will not change**. This is purely a backend modification to the method Scaleway uses to map IP addresses to the physical hypervisors hosting your resources. Moving to routed IP will simply update your current network interface for a new one, while keeping your attached IP address.

In this first phase, you may choose when to move your Public Gateway from NAT to routed by following the steps below at a time best suited to you. In a future phase, scheduled for 27th - 31st May 2024, all Public Gateways that still have NAT IPs will be automatically moved to routed IPs. We strongly recommend that you move your gateway to routed IP yourself, before automatic migration.

Note the following when moving a Public Gateway from NAT IP to routed IP:
- There should be only a few seconds of service interruption
- Your IP address will not change, and no additional configuration should be necessary
- Once done, this action cannot be undone
- Via the Scaleway console, you can only move Public Gateways one at a time to routed IP
- Via the [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/vpc/), you can move multiple Public Gateways at a time to routed IP.

Moving your Public Gateway to routed IPs will ensure that when features such as IPv6 are released in the future, your gateway will be compatible. The move from NAT to routed IPs is part of Scaleway's overarching IP mobility project. Read our blog post for [full information](https://www.scaleway.com/en/blog/ip-mobility-removing-nat/).

## How to move a Public Gateway to routed IP

When you move a Public Gateway to routed IP, it will become unavailable for a few seconds while the move is carried out. Choose the best time to carry out the following steps accordingly.

1. Click **Public Gateways** in the **Network** section of the side menu. A list of your Public Gateways displays.

2. Click **Move IP** next to the gateway you are ready to move to routed IP. A pop-up displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-confirm-p0.0.0.0/0gw-ip-move.webp" alt="" />

    Remember that:
    - Moving to routed IP affects only the underlying addressing technique
    - Your IP address will not change
    - You should experience only a few seconds of service unavailability while the move is carried out

3. Type **MOVE** in the box to confirm, and click **Move to routed IP**.

    The move is carried out and you are returned to the list of your Public Gateways, where a green `running` status dot indicates that your gateway is in service and has been successfully moved to routed IP.

    You can also access the `Move IP` button from an individual Public Gateway's **Overview** page.

## How to troubleshoot problems

If there are any problems in moving your Public Gateway to routed IP, your gateway will remain in a `Configuring` state, indicated by a blue status dot next to its name in the list of gateways. If this persists and your gateway does not return to a `Running` state with a green dot, open a [support ticket](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create).

## Additional information

From now on: 
- When you create a new Public Gateway, it will be automatically created with routed IP addressing. This is the case whether you choose to create a new flexible IP address for the gateway, or attach an existing IP address.
- When you create a new flexible IP address and attach it to an existing Public Gateway, the gateway will automatically be moved to routed IP (if not already moved).
