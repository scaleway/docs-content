## What can I write about?

You can write any tutorial that you think could be useful for Scaleway users. It must involve a Scaleway product, and any third-party tools the tutorial involves must be free to use and open-source. For example, you could write about how to integrate the Scaleway Database, Kubernetes or Object Storage products with third-party open-source tools in order to achieve specific goals. Check out our [existing tutorials](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/tutorials/) to see the kind of content we publish. If you need more inspiration, why not [take a look at existing documentation requests](https://github.com/scaleway/docs-content/issues) or [ask for ideas on the Community Slack](https://scaleway-community.slack.com/archives/C01J2BT8TGX)?
