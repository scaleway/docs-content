## Bash Scripting - Overview

[Bash](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)>) (short for Bourne again shell) represents an enhanced iteration of Sh (Bourne shell) and is inherently included in Linux and macOS operating systems. Functioning as a shell, it provides a command line interface (CLI) for interacting with a computer's operating system. This interface interprets commands in plain text format, relaying the instructions to the operating system to trigger corresponding actions.

A bash script essentially comprises a plain text file that houses a sequence of commands. This assortment of commands may encompass those that are familiar—ones you would normally manually input in the shell (such as `ls` or `cd`), alongside more intricate commands that are typically not entered manually due to their complexity. Essentially, any command accessible within the shell environment can be utilized within a bash script, and conversely.

Writing bash scripts does not necessitate specialized expertise. These scripts are composed of straightforward plain text, outlining the sequence of commands required to accomplish a specific task. Instead of manually typing these commands in the shell, you consolidate them into a script and subsequently execute the script. This methodology proves particularly advantageous for automating system administration chores, enabling the streamlining of tasks. Bash scripts commonly sport the file extension `*.sh`.

</Message>

## Getting Started

1. Connect to your Instance using [SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/):
```
ssh root@<Instance Public IP>
```
2. Update the `apt` packet cache and the software already installed on the Instance:
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
3. Create a new bash script and open it in a text editor, for example `nano`:
    ```
    nano xmas.sh
    ```
4. Copy the following bash code into the script:
    ```bash
    # The following line tells the shell what program to interpret the script with
    #!/bin/bash

    # tput is a command to manipulate the terminal, it can be used to change the color of text, apply effects, and generally brighten things up.
    trap "tput reset; tput cnorm; exit" 2
    clear
    tput civis
    lin=2
    col=$(($(tput cols) / 2))
    c=$((col-1))
    est=$((c-2))
    color=0

    # Set the text color to green to write the tree
    tput setaf 2; tput bold

    # Write the tree
    for ((i=1; i<40; i+=2))
    {
        tput cup $lin $col
        for ((j=1; j<=i; j++))
        {
            echo -n \*
        }
        let lin++
        let col--
    }

    ## Set the color to brown for the trunk
    tput sgr0; tput setaf 130

    # Write the Trunk in three lines
    for ((i=1; i<=3; i++))
    {
        tput cup $((lin++)) $c
        echo 'mWm'
    }

    # Write a greeting
    tput setaf 93; tput bold
    tput cup $lin $((c - 15)); echo SCALEWAY wishes you Merry Christmas
    tput cup $((lin + 1)) $((c - 11)); echo And a Happy New Year 2024
    let c++
    k=1

    # Configure lights and decorations
    while true; do
        for ((i=1; i<=35; i++)) {
            # Turn off the lights
            [ $k -gt 1 ] && {
                tput setaf 2; tput bold
                tput cup ${line[$[k-1]$i]} ${column[$[k-1]$i]}; echo \*
                unset line[$[k-1]$i]; unset column[$[k-1]$i]  # Array cleanup
            }

            li=$((RANDOM % 9 + 10))
            start=$((c-li+2))
            co=$((RANDOM % (li-2) * 2 + 1 + start))
            tput setaf $color; tput bold   # Switch colors
            tput cup $li $co
            echo o
            line[$k$i]=$li
            column[$k$i]=$co
            color=$(((color+1)%8))
        }
        k=$((k % 2 + 1))
    done
    ```
5. Paste the copied file and press `CTRL` and `s` to save.
6. Exit nano by pressing `CTRL` and `x`.
7. Make the script executable using the `chmod` command (necessary because, by default, plain text files are not executable):
    ```
    chmod +x xmas.sh
    ```

## Running the script

1. Run the script from your terminal by typing the following code:
    ```
    ./xmas.sh
    ```
    The script writes an animated tree on the terminal window:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-animated-tree.gif" alt="" />
2. Exit the script by pressing `CTRL` + `c`.
