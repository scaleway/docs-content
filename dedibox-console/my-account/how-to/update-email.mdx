Each Scaleway Dedibox account is linked to one email address. If your email address changes, you can update this information in your account.

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net) 

</Message>

1. Click your user name next to _logged in as:_ in the top right corner of the console. Then click **Account information** in the pop-up menu. The account information page displays.

2. Click **Update** next to your email address:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-dedibox-console-update-email.webp" width="800" alt="" />

  A link will be sent to the email address registered in the account.

3. Click the link sent to your registered email address, to access the email update form.

4. Enter your new email address and its confirmation. Then click **Update my mail** to submit.

  <Lightbox
    src="scaleway-dedibox-console-confirm-new-email.webp"
    width="800"
    alt=""
  />

You have now linked your new email address to your Scaleway Dedibox account.
