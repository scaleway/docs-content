Find out everything you need to know about how Edge Services is billed in this document.

## Edge Services billing basics

Edge Services billing is based on [monthly subscription plans](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/network/#edge-services). Three plans are available, with different prices and consumption limits:

- **Starter**
- **Professional**
- **Advanced** 

When you subscribe to a plan, you are billed its flat monthly fee, which allows you to:

- Run a fixed maximum number of Edge Services [pipelines](/edge-services/concepts/#pipeline) for the month. They can be for Object Storage or Load Balancer origins, or a mixture of both.
- Egress a fixed maximum amount of data from all your pipelines' [caches](/edge-services/concepts/#cache).
- Filter a fixed maximum amount of requests through [WAF](/edge-services/concepts/#waf)

<Message type="note">
WAF is currently in Public Beta and therefore **free of charge**. For now it is only available via the [Edge Services API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/edge-services/). It will be coming soon to the Scaleway console. When WAF enters General Availability, the free pricing model will end.
</Message>

If you subscribe to a plan, and exceed its monthly limits for pipelines, cache data, or WAF requests you will incur additional charges that month. 

Essentially, your Edge Services monthly bill is made up of your **monthly subscription plan price** + **any additional pipeline charges incurred** + **any additional cache charges incurred**.

For full details of the price and limits of each plan, refer to the [pricing page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/network/#edge-services). Subscription plans are scoped to a single Scaleway [Project](/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project).

## Keeping track of your Edge Services consumption

You can check the number of pipelines you have at any one time in the **Pipelines** tab of the Edge Services dashboard in the Scaleway console. [Scaleway Cockpit](/edge-services/how-to/monitor-cockpit/) can be used to monitor the data egressing from your Edge Services caches.

## WAF

<Message type="note">
WAF is in Public Beta, and currently available free of charge and only via the [Edge Services API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/edge-services/). It will be coming soon to the Scaleway console.

Although it is currently available free of charge, read on to find out more about how it will be charged once in General Availability

Each plan (except Starter plan) will include a fixed amount of WAF requests to use across all your pipelines. If you exceed the amount of WAF requests in a month that is allowed on your plan (or by the Starter add-on), you will be charged a fee per million additional requests.

The **Starter** plan will be the only plan that does not include a set amount of WAF requests. To use WAF on this plan, you must pay an additional monthly add-on charge. This add-on will then let you enable WAF on all your pipelines, and use a fixed amount of WAF requests for that month across all pipelines.A ny WAF requests that exceed this amount will be charged additionally.

## Included usage vs additional charges

Additional charges apply when you either:

- Have more pipelines in existence (at any given time) than the limit of your monthly plan
- Egress more data from all your pipelines' caches combined, than the limit of your monthly plan

Read on to understand more about how additional charges are applied.

### Additional pipeline charges

Additional pipeline charges are based on a monthly fee per additional pipeline. This monthly fee is applied pro-rata based on how long you had additional pipelines in existence during the calendar month.

For example:

- For the entire month of November, you are subscribed to the **Starter** plan, which has a limit of 1 pipeline.
- You start the month with 1 pipeline (A) in existence, which runs until the end of the month.
- On November 5 you create a second pipeline (B), which you later delete on November 10.
- On November 15 you create another pipeline (C), which runs until the end of the month. 

There are 30 days in the month of November. 
- Pipeline A falls within the limit of your Starter plan, so is not billed.
- Pipeline B was an additional pipeline which existed for 5 days
- Pipeline C is an additional pipeline which existed for 15 days

Your November Edge Services billing, in terms of additional pipeline charges, is therefore calculated as follows:

`({Monthly flat fee for an additional pipeline} / 30 days) * 5 days` + `({Monthly flat fee for an additional pipeline} / 30 days) * 15 days` <br/>
e.g. `(4 / 30) * 5 = €0.67` +  `(4 / 30) * 15 = €2` = `€2.67`

### Additional cache charges

Cache consumption is based on the volume of data egressed from all your Edge Services pipelines' caches combined, in a given month. The transfer of data from the origin bucket or Load Balancer into the cache, or directly from the origin to a user, does not count towards the limit of your plan, and does not incur any additional charges.

For every extra GB of data that is egressed from your Edge Services caches in a month, **beyond** the limit of your monthly plan, an additional charge applies.

For example:

- For the entire month of November, you are subscribed to the **Starter** plan, which has a limit of 100 GB of cache data.
- Over the course of the month, a total of 300 GB of data is egressed from your Edge Services caches. 

You consumed 200 GB of cache data that was not included within your monthly plan. Your November Edge Services billing, in terms of additional cache charges, is therefore calculated as follows:

`{Fee per GB of additional cache} * 200 GB` <br/>
e.g. `0.0135 * 200 = €2.70`

## Changing your subscription plan

You can upgrade or downgrade your subscription plan at any time. Read on to understand how changing plan mid-month affects your billing.

### Monthly plan price

You will be billed pro-rata for the old and new monthly plan prices, based on how long you were subscribed to each plan during the billing month. 

For example:

<Message type="important">
The example prices and limits used below are subject to change. You should always refer to the [pricing page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/network/#edge-services) for the most up to date information.
</Message>

- From November 1-10 you are subscribed to the **Starter** plan.
- On November 11, you switch to the **Professional** plan.
- You remain subscribed to the **Professional** plan for the rest of the month (ending November 30)

There are 30 days in the month of November, and you spent 10 of them subscribed to the Starter plan, and 20 of them subscribed to the Professional plan. Your November Edge Services billing, in terms of the monthly plan price, is therefore calculated as follows:

`({Monthly price for Starter plan} / 30 days) * 10 days` + `({Monthly price for Professional plan} / 30 days) * 20 days` <br/>
e.g. `(0.99 / 30) * 10 = 0.33` + `(12.99 / 30) * 20 = 8.66 ` = `€8.99`

### Pipeline charges

Any additional pipeline charges accumulated when you had more pipelines in existence than the previous plan's limit will remain on your monthly bill. From the moment you change your plan, you can consume pipelines up to the new plan's monthly limit without being charged.

Additional pipeline charges are based on a monthly fee per additional pipeline. This monthly fee is applied pro-rata based on how long you had additional pipelines in existence during the calendar month.

- From November 1-10 you are subscribed to the **Starter** plan, which has a limit of 1 pipeline.
- You have 2 pipelines in existence during these 10 days.
- On November 11, you upgrade to the **Professional** plan, which has a limit of 10 pipelines.
- You create 8 more pipelines, which you keep for the rest of the month: you finish the month with 10 pipelines.

There are 30 days in the month of November. For 10 of these days, you had an extra pipeline beyond the limits of your **Starter** plan. After upgrading, and even after creating more pipelines, you were within the pipeline limits of your new plan. Your November Edge Services billing, in terms of the additional pipeline charges, is therefore calculated as follows:

`({Monthly flat fee for an additional pipeline} / 30 days) * 10 days` <br/>
e.g. `(4 / 30) * 10 = €1.33`

### Cache charges

Any additional cache charges accumulated when you exceeded your previous plan's cache limit will remain on your monthly bill. From the moment you change your plan, your cache consumption resets to 0. During the rest of the month, you can consume cache up to the new plan's limit without being charged.  

<Message type="note">
- If you **downgrade** your plan, all the data egressed from the cache within the hour of changing plans will count towards the cache consumption of the new plan. 
- If you **upgrade** your plan, all the data egressed from the cache within the hour of changing plans will count towards the cache consumption of the old plan.

- From November 1-10 you are subscribed to the **Starter** plan, which has a cache limit of 100 GB.
- From November 1-10 you consume 300 GB of cache data.
- On November 11, you upgrade to the **Professional** plan, which has a limit of 1 TB of cache data. Your cache usage resets to 0.
- Between November 11 and the end of the month, you consume 1 TB of cache data.

You consumed 200 GB of cache data that was not included within your monthly Starter plan, between November 1-10. For the rest of the month, you were within the limits of your new Professional plan. Your November Edge Services billing, in terms of the additional cache charges, is therefore calculated as follows:

`{Fee per GB of additional cache} * 200 GB` <br/>
e.g. `0.0135 * 200 = €2.70`
