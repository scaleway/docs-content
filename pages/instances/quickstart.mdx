Scaleway [Instances](/instances/concepts/#instance) are computing units that provide you with resources to run your applications. After you have created your Instance and installed your image of choice (e.g., an operating system), you can connect to it via SSH to use it as you wish. When you are done using the Instance, you can delete it from your account.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)

## How to create an Instance

    1. Click **CPU Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The [Instance dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) displays.
    2. Click **Create Instance**. The [Instance creation page](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) displays.
    3. Complete the following steps:
        - **Choose an Availability Zone**, which represents the geographical region where your Instance will be deployed.
        - **Choose an Instance type**. <br />
          Instance offers vary in pricing, processing power, memory, storage, and bandwidth. [Discover the best Instance type for your needs](/instances/reference-content/choosing-instance-type/).
        - **Choose an image** to run on your Instance. <br />
          This can be an operating system, an InstantApp, or a custom image. [Check all available Linux distributions and InstantApps](/instances/reference-content/images-and-instantapps/).
        - **Name your Instance**, or leave the randomly-generated name in place. Optionally, you can add [tags](/instances/concepts/#tags) to help you organize your Instance.
        - **Add Volumes**, which are storage spaces used by your Instances. A block volume with a default name and 5,000 IOPS is automatically provided for your system volume. You can customize this volume and attach up to 16 local and/or block type volumes as needed.
          <Message type="important">
             - Ensure that the volume containing your OS image has a minimum size of 10 GB. For a GPU OS, the recommended size is 125 GB.
             - When multiple Block Storage volumes are linked to your Instance, the primary volume will host the OS and is essential for booting the Instance. Once the Instance is created can [modify your boot volume](/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes/#how-to-change-the-boot-volume).
             - Booting from a volume that either lacks an OS or is among multiple volumes with identical operating systems can lead to inconsistent boot outcomes.
          </Message>
        - **Configure network** of the Instance.
          - Leave the checkbox ticked to assign a **Public IPv4** to the Instance. You can either allocate a new IPv4 address or select one or multiple existing IPv4s. Alternatively, uncheck the box if you do not want an IPv4.
          - Leave the checkbox ticked to assign a **Public IPv6** to the Instance. You can either allocate a new IPv6 address or select one or multiple existing IPv6s. Alternatively, uncheck the box if you do not want an IPv6.
            <Message type="tip">
              You can attach up to 5 IPs to an Instance, combining IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, which is useful for running different services or applications on the same Instance.
            </Message>
        - (Optional) Click **Cloud-init** to configure a [cloud-init configuration](/instances/concepts/#cloud-init). Otherwise, leave this option set to its default values.
          You can configure a cloud-init script to automate Instance setup, such as setting up software, users, and system configurations at the first boot.
        - **Verify the [SSH keys](/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#ssh-key)** that will give you access to your Instance.
        - **Verify the Estimated cost** of your Instance, based on the specifications you chose.
    4. Click **Create Instance**. The creation of your Instance begins, and you will be informed when the Instance is ready.
        Once the Instance is created, you can connect to it using the SSH keys you have configured, and begin setting up your applications.

## How to connect to an Instance

### How to connect from OSX (Mac) and Linux

1. Open a terminal program.
2. Enter the command below into the terminal. Make sure you replace `your_private_key` with the filename of your private key (often `id_rsa`) and `your_instance_ip` with the IP address of your Instance.
    ```sh
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_private_key root@your_instance_ip
    ```
3. If / when prompted, allow connection to the host by typing `yes`, then press **Enter**.
    ```
    The authenticity of host 'myhost.ext (212.47.226.35)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is 4f:ba:65:cf:14:64:a7:1e:b6:07:7c:00:71:95:21:fa.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
    ```

You are now connected to your Instance.


### How to connect from Windows

To connect to your Instance from Windows, you will need to use a small application called **PuTTY**, an SSH client.

1. [Download and install PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).
2. Launch PuTTY on your computer.
3. Enter your Instance's IP address in the **Hostname** field.
4. In the side menu, under **Connection**, navigate to the **Auth** sub-category. (**Connection** > **SSH** > **Auth**).
5. Click the **Browse** button and select the private key file you [created previously](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/).
6. Click **Open** at the bottom of the screen to open a connection to the Instance. PuTTY asks you to allow the connection to the host.
7. Click **OK** to confirm. The terminal window displays.
8. Enter the username `root` and press **Enter** to authenticate against the server with your SSH key.

    You are now connected to your Instance.

## How to delete an Instance

<Message type="important">
  Deleting an Instance will destroy all the volumes and data stored on that Instance. Note that your Instance must be powered off or stopped to be deleted.
</Message>

1. Click **CPU Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The [Instances page](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) displays.
2. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the Instance you want to delete and select **Delete** from the drop-down menu. A pop-up asks you to confirm the action.
3. Type **DELETE** and then click **Delete Instance**.
