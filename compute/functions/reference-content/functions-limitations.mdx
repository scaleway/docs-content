## Quotas
The limits mentioned here before are technical limits. To prevent fraud we also apply the following quotas.

| Resource            | Quota 1 | Quota 2 | Quota 3 and upper* |
|---------------------|---------|---------|--------------------|
| Function Namespaces | 10      | 20      | 30                 |
| Number of functions | 25      | 50      | 100                |
| Max Ram             | 25 GB   | 100 GB  | 400 GB             |

*To change your quota please reach our support

The Max RAM quotas is obtain by multiplying the Max scale of your container by the selected RAM quantity.
For example if you chose to create a container with 512 MB of memory and a max scale of 20, you will have a Max RAM of 10 GB

## Configuration Restrictions

In order to ensure the proper functioning of the product, we restrict the use of certain ports and environment variables.

* Blocked Port: 
  * **25**: Due to potential abuse (SPAM), no outbound traffic is allowed through this port.

* Reserved environment variables: 
  * `SCW_*`: Reserved for product configuration (for example: token validation)
