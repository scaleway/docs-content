## Problem

I get error messages when testing Serverless Functions using the Scaleway Console.

## Cause

**Private** Serverless Functions require you use an authentication token.

## Possible solutions

- Change the visibility of your function to **public**. Public functions can be executed anonymously.

- Make sure you have created an [authentication token](/serverless-functions/how-to/create-auth-token-from-console/) for your private function, then execute a `curl` request from a terminal, as shown below:
    ```bash
    export $TOKEN=<YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>
    curl -H "X-Auth-Token: $TOKEN" \ <YOUR_FUNCTION_ENDPOINT>
    ```
