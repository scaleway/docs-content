Observability allows you to monitor your applications and their infrastructure behavior. In addition, it enables you to visualize your metrics and logs through a Grafana dashboard.

<Concept opened>

## Alerting

Alerting detects complex conditions defined by a rule and keeps you aware of issues in your environments. When a condition defined by a rule is met, the rule tracks it as an alert and responds by triggering one or more actions.

</Concept>

<Concept opened>

## Alert manager

Scaleway's alert manager allows you to manage and respond to alerts. It handles alerts sent when the alerting rules we run are firing. The alert manager triggers alerts (e.g. emails or texts) if a criteria you have configured on your applications' metrics and logs is activated.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Alerting rules

Alerting rules allow you to define criteria that determine whether an alert is triggered. The rule consists of queries and expressions, a condition, the frequency of evaluation, and the duration over which the condition is met. When an alert is triggered, a notification is sent to the alert manager, which forwards the notification to receivers.

</Concept>

## Cockpit

A Cockpit is an instance of the Observability product that has a dedicated Grafana instance. A Scaleway Project can have only one Cockpit.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Contact points

Contact points define how your contacts are notified when an alert fires. Contact point types include emails, Slack and texts. When an alert fires, a notification is sent to all contact point types listed for a contact point.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Endpoints

An endpoint is the point of entry in a communication channel when two systems are interacting. The endpoint is the means from which the API can access the resources they need from a server to perform their task. An endpoint can include a URL of a server or service.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Loki Remote Write

``Loki Remote Write`` is a feature that allows you to send metrics from almost any device to a Loki server.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## LogQL

LogQL is Grafana Loki’s language for querying logs. LogQL uses labels and operators for filtering.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Logs

Logs provide a record of all events and errors that take place during the lifecycle of your resources. They represent an excellent source of visibility if you want to know when a problem occurred, or which events correlate with it.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Managed alerts

Managed alerts are alert criteria that Scaleway defines for you. They allow you to receive alerts for behaviors that we deem abnormal on your products.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Managed dashboards

A managed dashboard is a set of one or more panels organized into one or more rows where you can visualize your data.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Metric

A metric is a lifecycle-related numerical representation of data (e.g. disk usage and CPU usage) measured over intervals of time. Metrics give you a bird's eye view of your infrastructure.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Monitoring

Monitoring is a tool that allows you to watch and understand the state of your systems. Monitoring is based on gathering predefined sets of metrics or logs.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Prometheus Remote Write

``Prometheus Remote Write`` is a feature that allows you to send your metrics from almost any device to a Prometheus server.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## PromQL

PromQL, short for Prometheus Querying Language, is the main way to query metrics within Prometheus. It is designed for building queries for graphs and alerts.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Receivers

Receivers are hubs consisting of contacts points. You can associate one or several alerts with one or more receivers. This allows you to diversify your alerts.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Recording rules

Recording rules allow you to precompute frequently needed or computationally expensive expressions and save their results as a new set of time series.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Samples

A sample is a unique measuring point on a time series.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Time series

A time series is a sequence of numerical data points in successive order, that tracks a sample over time.

</Concept>

<Concept>


## Tokens

Tokens are secret keys that allow you to grant other cloud providers’ services and platforms access to your Cockpit. You can generate new tokens and select token permissions such as push and query. Push and query allow you to send and fetch your data (metrics and logs) to and from your Cockpit. You can also choose to configure alerting and recording rules or set up the alert manager via your tokens.
