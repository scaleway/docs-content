Private Load Balancers let you balance internal traffic or make your internal services highly available without being exposed to the Internet. 

Kubernetes users can now use the `scw-loadbalancer-private` annotation on their services. Load Balancers are public if this annotation is unset or false. Find the [Cloud Controller Manager documentation here](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cloud-controller-manager/blob/master/docs/loadbalancer-annotations.md#servicebetakubernetesioscw-loadbalancer-private)
