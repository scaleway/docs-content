Some features of the Instances product require Scaleway's infrastructure to query or exchange information with your instance. To enable this communication, a software component must run on the guest operating system: the QEMU Guest Agent (QGA).

This document provides essential insights into this mechanism.

<Message type="note">
  This document does not apply to Instances running the Microsoft Windows operating system.

## What are the features provided by QGA?

Running the QEMU Guest Agent (QGA) on your Instance currently enables the following feature:

- **Automatic network reconfiguration** upon flexible IP attachment or detachment.

Additional features may be added in the future.

## Checking the status of QGA

Since March 1, 2024, all Scaleway-provided GNU/Linux and InstantApp images for Instances come with QGA pre-installed and enabled by default.

To verify that QGA is running on your Instance, use the following command:

```bash
# systemctl is-active qemu-guest-agent.service
```

If the output is `active`, QGA is running, and you are ready to benefit from the associated features. If the output is `inactive`, you may need to install and/or activate QGA.

## Opting In

Follow these steps to enable QGA on an Instance where it is currently inactive.

### Installation

Instances created from images older than March 1, 2024, may require manual installation of the `qemu-guest-agent` package:

- **Fedora / AlmaLinux / RockyLinux / CentOS**

  ```bash
  # yum -y install qemu-guest-agent
  ```

- **Debian / Ubuntu**

  ```bash
  # apt-get update
  # apt-get -y install qemu-guest-agent
  ```

### Activation

After installing the package, start the `qemu-guest-agent.service` by either:

- Rebooting your instance, or
- Running the following command:

  ```bash
  # systemctl start qemu-guest-agent.service
  ```

## Opting Out

Follow these steps to disable QGA and the associated Scaleway features.

### Deactivation

<Message type="important">
  Disabling QGA is not recommended, as doing so also disables all [Scaleway features](#what-are-the-features-provided-by-qga) it provides.
</Message>

To stop and disable QGA, run:

```bash
# systemctl stop qemu-guest-agent.service
# systemctl mask qemu-guest-agent.service
```

This stops the service and prevents it from starting on subsequent reboots.

### Deinstallation (Optional)

<Message type="note">
  Deinstalling QGA is not strictly necessary to opt out. [Deactivating the service](#deactivation) is sufficient.
</Message>

If you prefer to completely remove QGA, ensure the service is stopped first, then run:

- **Fedora / AlmaLinux / RockyLinux / CentOS**

  ```bash
  # yum -y remove qemu-guest-agent
  ```

- **Debian / Ubuntu**

  ```bash
  # apt-get -y purge qemu-guest-agent
  ```
