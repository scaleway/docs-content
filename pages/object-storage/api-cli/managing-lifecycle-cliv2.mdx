[Scaleway Object Storage](/object-storage/concepts/#object-storage) is a service based on the Amazon S3 protocol. It allows you to store different types of objects (documents, images, videos, etc.) and distribute them instantly, anywhere in the world. You can create and manage your Object Storage resources from the [console](https://account.scaleway.com/login), or via the [Scaleway Command Line Interface](/scaleway-cli/quickstart/) that uses external tools such as [S3cmd](https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd), [Rclone](https://rclone.org/downloads/) or [MinIO Client (mc)](https://github.com/minio/mc).

## Scaleway Command Line Interface Overview

[The Scaleway Command Line Interface (CLI)](/scaleway-cli/quickstart/) allows you to pilot your Scaleway infrastructure directly from your terminal, providing a faster way to administer and monitor your resources. Scaleway CLI is easy to set up and is an essential tool for operating efficiently in your cloud environment.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
- An [Object Storage bucket](/object-storage/how-to/create-a-bucket/)
- Installed and initialized the [Scaleway CLI](/scaleway-cli/quickstart/)
- Downloaded [S3cmd](https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd), [Rclone](https://rclone.org/downloads/) and [MinIO Client (mc)](https://github.com/minio/mc)

## Previewing an Object Storage configuration file for the Scaleway CLI

The `scw object config get` command allows you to output the content of the configuration file in a terminal and preview the different fields.

## Installing a configuration file for Amazon S3-compatible tools (s3cmd, rclone, and mc)

The `scw object config install` allows you to create a configuration file for the selected third party tool based on your [Scaleway CLI configuration](/scaleway-cli/quickstart/).

<Message type="important">
  Creating a new configuration file using `scw object config install` will overwrite the existing one for the specified third party tool. To update an existing configuration, [generate a preview](#previewing-an-object-storage-configuration-file-for-the-scaleway-cli) and manually edit the configuration file.
