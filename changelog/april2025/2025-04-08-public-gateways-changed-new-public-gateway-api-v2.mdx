We've just released a new Public Gateway API v2, which comes with a new SSH Bastion security feature. This version also removes some old DHCP features that are now managed by the IPAM and the built-in DHCP of the Private Networks.

The API v1 is now deprecated and will be definitively removed by October 1, 2025. Public Gateways users are encouraged to migrate to the API v2.
A comprehensive detailed documentation is available here: https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/public-gateways/reference-content/understanding-v2/
