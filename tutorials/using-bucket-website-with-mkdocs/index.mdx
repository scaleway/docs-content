This tutorial shows you how to create a documentation website using the Scaleway [Object Storage bucket website]() feature with Material for MkDocs.

MkDocs is a static site generator that allows users to generate a static website from a set of Markdown files. It is written in Python and uses Markdown for content creation.
We will use MkDocs to generate our website, and Material for MkDocs which is a documentation framework that extends MkDocs with additional features and customization options, to create visually appealing and user-friendly documentation websites.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created an Object Storage bucket
- Installed Python
- Installed pip
- Installed VS Code
- Knowledge of the [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/#what-is-markdown) markup language

## Setting up Material for MkDocs

1. Open the VS Code terminal and paste the following command to create a virtual environment to host your Material for mkdocs content:
  ```
  python -m venv envname
  ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:

  ```
  source envname/bin/activate
  ```
3. Create a folder inside your virtual environment. This folder will contain your documentation folder.

  ```
  mkdir my-folder
  ```
    <Message type="note">
     Avoid naming your folder `docs` as this is already the default name for the Material for mkdocs folder.
    </Message>
4. Install mkdocs and mkdocs-material in the virtual environment:
  ```
  pip install mkdocs
  pip install mkdocs-material
  ```
5. Open the documentation folder you have created and enter the following command:
  ```
  mkdocs new .
  ```
    <Message type="note">
     This will create a YAML file named `mkdocs.yaml`, and a folder named `docs` containing an `index.md` file inside `my-folder`:
     - `docs` is where you will need to create `.md` files containing your website's content.
     - `index.md` is your website's homepage.
     - `mkdocs.yml` is where you will customize your website's appearance.
    </Message>

  The architecture of your folder should look like the following:
    ```
    my-folder
    ├─ docs/
    │  └─ index.md
    └─ mkdocs.yml
    ```
6. Create `.md` files inside the `docs` folder and add the content part of your website.
