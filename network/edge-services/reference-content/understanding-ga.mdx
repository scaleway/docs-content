Scaleway Edge Services is leaving Public Beta and going into General Availability. Read on to find out more about when this will happen, what it means for current users, and how the product will be billed.

## Edge Services Public Beta

Edge Services for Object Storage and Load Balancer is currently in Public Beta. This means that the product is ready to be tested by customers, but some features may be missing, and usage is intended for test environments rather than production. Edge Services is free to use during Public Beta, and is not billed.

## Edge Services General Availability

From **November 1st 2024** Edge Services will transition to General Availability, for both Object Storage and Load Balancer usage. This means that:
- We consider that the product is ready for production environments.
- The product will no longer be free to use, and will be billed. 

## Edge Services pricing

Once in General Availability, Edge Services will be billed via **subscription**. Three different subscription plans will be available, each including different amounts of monthly usage for **cache size** and **number of pipelines**. If your consumption of Edge Services in a given month exceeds the cache size and number of pipelines included in your subscription, you will be billed for this extra usage on top of your plan. 

<Message type="tip">
An Edge Services pipeline consists of an origin for which Edge Services requests and caches content, and an endpoint from which this content is served via Edge Services. In the case of Object Storage, a pipeline corresponds to a bucket Edge Services is enabled on. If Edge Services is enabled on three different buckets, this equals three pipelines. In the case of Load Balancer, pipelines are already an explicit concept in the console.
</Message>

On October 1st 2024, current users of Edge Services will receive an email with full details of the three subscription plans.

Pricing plan details can also be viewed on the [Scaleway pricing page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/network/).
