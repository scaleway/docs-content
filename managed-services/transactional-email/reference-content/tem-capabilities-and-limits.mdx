This page provides information about the capabilities and limits of Scaleway Transactional Email service, depending on user quotas.

Every [Organization](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#organization) has quotas, which are limits on the number of Scaleway resources they can use. Below is a list of quotas available for Transactional Email.

<Message type="important">
  - Keep in mind that when sending an email with Transactional Email, each recipient counts as a separate email. Example: If you send an email to one recipient and you add three recipients as CC, you will be billed for 4 emails.
  - Transactional Email is only available in the `fr-par` region.
  - The recursive SPF `include` directive is not supported.
