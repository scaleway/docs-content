New Kubernetes Kapsule clusters now natively incorporate version 0.3 of Scaleway's Container Storage Interface, granting users access to [Block Storage Low Latency volumes](/storage/block/quickstart/) via the three storage classes: `sbs-default`, `sbs-5k`, or `sbs-15k`.

Read our [tutorial to get started with Kubernetes Storage](/tutorials/get-started-kubernetes-storage/) for more information.

Note that: 

- **Migrations from CSI v0.2 to CSI v0.3 are not yet supported**.

- **When using the `no-scw-csi-v0.3` tag at cluster creation, new clusters can keep using the CSI version 0.2 and its legacy storage class `scw-sbs`**
