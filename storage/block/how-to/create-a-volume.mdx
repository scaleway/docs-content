  This procedure refers to low latency block volumes. To create legacy block volumes, refer the [dedicated documentation](/compute/instances/how-to/create-a-block-volume/).
</Message>

1. Click **Block Storage** in the **Storage** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The Block Storage page displays.
2. Click **+ Create volume**.
3. Follow the steps in the creation wizard:
    - Choose an [Availability Zone](/compute/instances/concepts/#availability-zone).
    - Configure the volume:
        - Enter a name for your volume or leave the automatically generated name.
        - Select an [IOPS](/storage/block/concepts/#iops).
        <Message type="important">
          You cannot edit the IOPS after you create your volume.
        </Message>

        - Define a volume size.
        <Message type="important">
          The volume size must be at least 5GB.
        </Message>
    - Select an Instance from the drop-down to attach your volume. This step is optional.
    - Check the estimated cost.
4. Click **Create volume**. The volumes overview page displays.
    <Message type="important">
      The volume must be in the same Availability Zone as the Instance you want to connect it to.
