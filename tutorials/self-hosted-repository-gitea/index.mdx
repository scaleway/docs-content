Gitea is a Git service that can be self-hosted to provide a lightweight code hosting solution. Written in Go and licensed under the MIT license, it is a community-managed fork of Gogs.

Git itself, is a distributed version control system used to track changes in files. Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, it was initially designed to manage the development of the Linux kernel among a community of developers.

Unlike many other client-server systems, Git allows every Git directory on every computer to contain the entire repository with a complete history and version tracking, enabling it to be independent of network access or a central server.

While Git was initially developed for software development purposes, it can track changes in any file.

## Installing Gitea

1. Log into your server via SSH.
2. Update the APT package cache, upgrade the already installed software and install Git:
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y && apt install git -y
    ```
3. Download the Gitea Binary and make it executable:
    ```
    wget -O gitea https://dl.gitea.com/gitea/1.22/gitea-1.22-linux-amd64
    chmod +x gitea
    ```
4. Add the user that will run the Gitea application:
    ```
    adduser --system --shell /bin/bash --gecos 'Git Version Control' --group --disabled-password --home /home/git git
    ```
5. Create the folder structure that is used by Gitea to store data:
    ```
    mkdir -p /var/lib/gitea/custom
    mkdir -p /var/lib/gitea/data
    mkdir -p /var/lib/gitea/log
    chown -R git:git /var/lib/gitea/
    chmod -R 750 /var/lib/gitea/
    mkdir /etc/gitea
    chown root:git /etc/gitea
    chmod 770 /etc/gitea
    ```
6. Set the working directory of Gitea:
    ```
    export GITEA_WORK_DIR=/var/lib/gitea/
    ```
7. Copy the Gitea binary file to `/usr/local/bin` to make it available system-wide:
    ```
    cp gitea /usr/local/bin/gitea
    ```

## Running Gitea

1. Create a systemd service for Gitea by opening the file `/etc/systemd/system/gitea.service` in a text editor like `nano`.
2. Copy the following content into the service file:
    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=Gitea (Git with a cup of tea)
    After=syslog.target
    After=network.target
    #Requires=mysql.service
    #Requires=mariadb.service
    #Requires=postgresql.service
    #Requires=memcached.service
    #Requires=redis.service

    [Service]
    # Modify these two values and uncomment them if you have
    # repos with lots of files and get an HTTP error 500 because
    # of that
    ##
    #LimitMEMLOCK=infinity
    #LimitNOFILE=65535
    RestartSec=2s
    Type=simple
    User=git
    Group=git
    WorkingDirectory=/var/lib/gitea/
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/gitea web -c /etc/gitea/app.ini
    Restart=always
    Environment=USER=git HOME=/home/git GITEA_WORK_DIR=/var/lib/gitea
    # If you want to bind Gitea to a port below 1024 uncomment
    # the two values below
    ##
    #CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
    #AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```
3. Enable the service and start Gitea at system boot:
    ```
    systemctl enable gitea.service
    systemctl start gitea.service
    ```
4. Start Gitea for the first time from the command-line:
    ```
    GITEA_WORK_DIR=/var/lib/gitea/ /usr/local/bin/gitea web -c /etc/gitea/app.ini
    ```
5. In a web browser go to `http://<your_instance_ip>:3000/` to access the Gitea application:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-gitea_app.webp" alt="" />
6. Click **Register** to start the database initialization. Gitea supports [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) which makes the application very lightweight and ideal for a self-hosted development Environment. If you require more performance, it is also possible to use [MySQL/MariaDB](/tutorials/mariadb-ubuntu-bionic/) or [PostgreSQL](/tutorials/install-postgresql/).
7. Choose **SQLite** as database type. Leave the other pre-filled settings as they are, they are already set to the required values and confirm the form.
8. The installation is now ready, and it is time to create the first user. Open `http://<your_instance_ip>:3000/user/sign_up` in a web browser and fill in the required parameters.
    <Message type="note">
      The first user becomes automatically **admin** of the Gitea instance.
    </Message>
9. Once the form has been submitted, you are logged into your Gitea account:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-gitea_dashboard.webp" alt="" />

You can now configure your profile and begin to host code on your instance.

## Setting up a Nginx SSL/TLS reverse proxy

For increased security, it is possible to configure [NGINX reverse proxy](/tutorials/nginx-reverse-proxy/) with TSL/SSL in front of the Gitea instance. It handles all requests sent from a client to the web interface and adds a layer of increased security and performance.

1. Install Nginx:
    ```
    apt install nginx
    ```
2. Disable the default virtual host which has been configured during the installation of Nginx via the APT package manager:
    ```
    unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
    ```
3. Enter the directory `/etc/nginx/sites-available` and create a reverse proxy configuration file:
    ```
    cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
    nano reverse-proxy.conf
    ```
4. Paste the following Nginx configuration block in the text editor. The proxy server redirects all incoming connections to the web server listening on port 80, to the local Gitea application, listening on port 3000.
    ```
    server {
            listen 80;
            listen [::]:80;
            server_name gitea.example.com;

            access_log /var/log/nginx/reverse-access.log;
            error_log /var/log/nginx/reverse-error.log;

            location / {
                        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
      }
    }
    ```
5. Create a symbolic link from `/etc/nginx/sites-available/reverse-proxy.conf` to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/reverse-proxy.conf` to activate the new configuration:
    ```
    ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/reverse-proxy.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/reverse-proxy.conf
    ```
6. Restart Nginx:
    ```
    service nginx restart
    ```
7. [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) is a tool that is able to obtain and renew [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) TLS certificates. Add it to the APT repository and install the Certbot application
    ```
    apt install software-properties-common
    add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
    apt update && apt install python-certbot-nginx -y
    ```
8. Certbot is able to configure the Nginx automatically. Run the application and specify the flag `--nginx` to configure the web server:
    ```
    certbot --nginx
    ```
9. When asked to do so, enter your email address and press **Enter**.
10. Confirm the Terms of Service of Let's Encrypt by pressing on `A` to agree.
11. Certbot asks you if you want to share your email address with the [Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)](https://www.eff.org/). Confirm it by pressing `Y` or refuse it by pressing `N`.
12. A list of domain names configured on the server is displayed. Press **Enter** to confirm:
    ```
    Which names would you like to activate HTTPS for?
    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    1: gitea.example.com
    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    Select the appropriate numbers separated by commas and/or spaces, or leave input
    blank to select all options shown (Enter 'c' to cancel):
    ```
13. Certbot requests the certificate for the domain name indicated in the previous step. Decide whether you want to force HTTPS on all connections by pressing `1` or not, by pressing `2`, followed by **Enter**:
    ```
    Please choose whether or not to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS, removing HTTP access.
    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    1: No redirect - Make no further changes to the webserver configuration.
    2: Redirect - Make all requests redirect to secure HTTPS access. Choose this for
    new sites, or if you're confident your site works on HTTPS. You can undo this
    change by editing your web server's configuration.
    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    Select the appropriate number [1-2] then [enter] (press 'c' to cancel):
    ```
14. You can access Gitea via the Nginx Proxy now using an encrypted connection, by opening `https://gitea.example.com` in your web browser.

## Disabling Port 3000 in the Firewall

1. For increased security it is possible to block the access to port 3000 from the exterior to avoid direct connections to the Gitea application without passing through Nginx. Start by installing UFW as firewall on the instance:
    ```
    apt install ufw
    ```
2. Block all traffic by default:
    ```
    ufw default deny
    ```
3. Then allow outgoing connections:
    ```
    ufw default allow outgoing
    ```
4. Enable connections on the ports `22` (SSH), `80` (HTTP), `443` (HTTPS) via [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) and `53` (DNS) via [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) and [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol) as both are required for DNS:
    ```
    ufw allow 22/tcp
    ufw allow 80/tcp
    ufw allow 443/tcp
    ufw allow 53
    ```
5. Activate the new firewall configuration:
    ```
    ufw enable
    ```
6. Connections to all other ports than the ones mentioned above are blocked now. The access to the Gitea Application is only possible by passing through the Nginx proxy.
