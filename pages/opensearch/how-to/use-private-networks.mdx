Private Networks allow your Cloud Essentials for OpenSearch deployments to communicate in an isolated and secure network without needing to be connected to the public internet. Each deployment can be connected to one Private Network.

For full information about Scaleway Private Networks and VPC, see our [dedicated documentation](/vpc/) and [best practices guide](/vpc/reference-content/getting-most-private-networks/).
