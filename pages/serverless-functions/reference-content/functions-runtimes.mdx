The Serverless Functions runtimes are the environment in which your code runs.
We currently support five languages:
* Javascript (NodeJS runtime)
* Python
* Go
* PHP
* Rust

## Runtime lifecycle

New runtimes are added periodically, based on user demand.

| Status                             | Description                                                                                                                        |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Beta (`beta`)                      | The runtime has been released recently, users can test it and provide feedback, but it is not yet suitable for a production environment. |
| General Availability (`available`) | The runtime is available to be used in a production environment.                                                                   |

When runtimes are no longer supported, they pass through different phases:

| Status                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Deprecated (`deprecated`)         | The runtime is still available, but a warning announcing the upcoming End Of Support displays when a new function is created.                                                          |
| End Of Support (`end_of_support`) | It is no longer possible to create a new function with this runtime; however, functions that already use it, can still be updated. A message with the date of End of Life is displayed. |
| End Of Life (`end_of_life`)       | Functions that use this runtime will still be working, but it is no longer possible to update them.                                                                                      |

## Runtime upgrade

To modify a runtime version, you simply need to change the runtime value.

For example, to migrate from `node18` to `node20`, change the runtime field and redeploy your function. Deployed runtimes are forward-compatible but not necessarily backward-compatible.

Once a function is in a `deprecated`, `end_of_support`, or `end_of_life` status,  you are invited to upgrade your ongoing runtime to take advantage of new features, better performance, and security fixes.
