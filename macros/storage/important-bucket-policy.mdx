<Message type="important">
    - You can lose access to your bucket if you are not the [owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) of the organization and if you are not explicitly allowed by the bucket policy.
    - Each bucket can have only one bucket policy.
    - Pushing a new bucket policy to a bucket overwrites any existing bucket policy.
    - The [owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) of the Organization always has the right to put and delete bucket policies and can access all resources and features in their Organization.
