This tutorial shows you how to create a documentation website using the Scaleway [Object Storage bucket website](/storage/object/concepts/#bucket-website) feature with Material for MkDocs.

[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is a static site generator that allows users to generate a static website from a set of Markdown files. It is written in Python and uses Markdown for content creation.
We will use MkDocs to generate our website, and Material for MkDocs which is a documentation framework that extends MkDocs with additional features and customization options, to create visually appealing and user-friendly documentation websites.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created an Object Storage bucket
- Installed Python
- Installed pip
- Installed VS Code
- Knowledge of the [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/#what-is-markdown) markup language

## Setting up Material for MkDocs

1. Open the VS Code terminal and paste the following command to create a virtual environment to host your MkDocs content:
  ```
  python -m venv envname
  ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:

  ```
  source envname/bin/activate
  ```
3. Create a folder inside your virtual environment. This folder will contain your documentation directory.

  ```
  mkdir my-folder
  ```
    <Message type="note">
     Avoid naming your folder `docs` as this is already the default name for the MkDocs directory.
    </Message>
4. Install MkDocs and the MkDocs Material theme in your virtual environment:
  ```
  pip install mkdocs
  pip install mkdocs-material
  ```
5. Open the documentation folder you have created and enter the following command:
  ```
  mkdocs new .
  ```
    <Message type="note">
     This will create a YAML file named `mkdocs.yaml`, and a directory named `docs` containing an `index.md` file inside `my-folder`:
     - `docs` is the directory where you will need to create `.md` files containing your website's content.
     - `index.md` is your website's homepage.
     - `mkdocs.yml` is the file in which you can configure and customize your website.
    </Message>

  The architecture of your folder should look like the following:
    ```
    my-folder
    ├─ docs/
    │  └─ index.md
    └─ mkdocs.yml
    ```

## Configuring your website

MkDocs provides many [configuration options](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/creating-your-site/#configuration) that you can use to create a beautiful website.


Open your `mkdocs.yml` file. The following output should display. We will add to it as we go.
    ```
    site_name: My documentation website
    site_url: https://mydomain.org/mysite
    theme:
      name: material
    ```

### Configuring the color palette

Material for MkDocs provides two default color schemes: `default`, which is the light mode, and `slate` which is the dark mode.

Copy and paste the following code template under `theme` in the `mkdocs.yml` file to define your website's color scheme. Feel free to replace `default` with `slate` if you want to use the dark mode scheme.

  ```
    palette:
      - scheme: default
  ```
Your file configuration should look like the following:

  ```
    site_name: My documentation website
    site_url: https://mydomain.org/mysite
    theme:
      name: material
      palette:
        - scheme: default
  ```

#### Configuring a primary color

You can use a specific primary color for your website's header, sidebar, and text links. Refer to the [MkDocs documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-colors/#primary-color)to find out which color options are available. You can also set [custom colors](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-colors/#custom-colors).

Copy and paste the following code template under `palette` to set your primary color to black.

```
    primary: black
```

#### Configuring an accent color

You can use an accent color to emphasize elements such as buttons, scrollbars, and hovered links. Refer to the [MkDocs documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-colors/#accent-color) for a list of available colors.

Copy and paste the following code template under `palette` to set your accent color to orange.

```
    accent: purple
```

#### Configuring the color palette toggle

You can give your users the choice to read your website in dark mode or light mode using a color palette toggle. Refer to the [documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-colors/#color-palette-toggle) for a list of available toggle options.

Copy and paste the following code template under `scheme` to set a color palette toggle.

```
    # Palette toggle for light mode
      toggle:
        icon: material/toggle-switch
        name: Switch to dark mode

    # Palette toggle for dark mode
      toggle:
        icon: material/toggle-switch-off-outline
        name: Switch to light mode
```

This is what your `mkdocs.yml` file should look like:

  ```
    site_name: My documentation website
    site_url: https://mydomain.org/mysite
    theme:
      name: material
      palette:
        # Palette toggle for light mode
        - scheme: default
          primary: black
          # Primary defines the primary color of the theme.
          accent: purple
          # Accent specifies the accent color of the theme.
          toggle:
          # toggle specifies the icon and name for toggling between light and dark modes.
            icon: material/toggle-switch
            name: Switch to dark mode

        # Palette toggle for dark mode
        - scheme: slate
          primary: white
          # primary defines the primary color of the theme.
          accent: deep purple
          # accent specifies the accent color of the theme.
          toggle:
          # toggle specifies the icon and name for toggling between light and dark modes.
            icon: material/toggle-switch-off-outline
            name: Switch to light mode
  ```

## Configuring fonts

Material for MkDocs integrates with [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) but you can also add custom fonts if you prefer.

Copy and paste the following code template to use the `Roboto` font.

```
  font:
    text: Roboto
```

Refer to the [documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-fonts/#changing-the-fonts) to further configure your website's font styles.

Your `mkdocs.yml` file should look like the following:

  ```
    site_name: My documentation website
    site_url: https://mydomain.org/mysite
    theme:
      name: material
      palette:
        # Palette toggle for light mode
        - scheme: default
          primary: black
          # Primary defines the primary color of the theme.
          accent: purple
          # Accent specifies the accent color of the theme.
          toggle:
          # toggle specifies the icon and name for toggling between light and dark modes.
            icon: material/toggle-switch
            name: Switch to dark mode

        # Palette toggle for dark mode
        - scheme: slate
          primary: white
          # primary defines the primary color of the theme.
          accent: deep purple
          # accent specifies the accent color of the theme.
          toggle:
          # toggle specifies the icon and name for toggling between light and dark modes.
            icon: material/toggle-switch-off-outline
            name: Switch to light mode
      font:
        text: Roboto
  ```
