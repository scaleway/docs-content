Yunohost is an open-source solution designed for the administration of a personal server. It helps manage users, domains, and websites and comes with a full email stack. The tool is designed to be lightweight and intuitive and is designed to work with Debian 9 (Stretch).

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An [Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) running on Debian 12 (Bookworm)
- A domain name pointed to your Instance

## Installing Yunohost

1. Connect to the Instance via [SSH](/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).
2. Update the APT package cache and the software already installed on the Instance:
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
3. Download and run the Yunohost installation script:
    ```
    curl https://install.yunohost.org | bash
    ```
    During the installation, a prompt will ask for permission to overwrite configuration files. Confirm this by selecting **Yes**.
    Yunohost might ask to reconfigure SSH, select **Yes** to disable the root login, and log in with the administrator account created by the application.

    The installation may take some time to download and install all required packages. Once it has been completed, the following message appears:

    ```
    [ OK ] YunoHost installation completed !
    ===============================================================================
    You should now proceed with Yunohost post-installation. This is where you will
    be asked for :
      - the main domain of your server ;
      - the administration password.

    You can perform this step :
      - from the command line, by running 'yunohost tools postinstall' as root
      - or from your web browser, by accessing :
        - https://<YOUR_INSTANCE_IP>/ (global IP, if you're on a VPS)

    If this is your first time with YunoHost, it is strongly recommended to take
    time to read the administator documentation and in particular the sections
    'Finalizing your setup' and 'Getting to know YunoHost'. It is available at
    the following URL : https://yunohost.org/admindoc
    ===============================================================================
    ```
  Once completed, perform the initial configuration from the web interface by typing in the address bar of your web browser the **public IP** address of your Instance.
4. A warning may appear in your browser, as the SSL certificate of Yunohost is self-signed:
    <Lightbox image={image} alt="" />

    Click **Advanced** to proceed to the site, which will display the post-installation interface. Click **Begin** to continue.
5. Set the main domain for the Yunohost Instance. You can either add a domain or subdomain, request a free subdomain from the Yunohost project, or opt for a domain for local usage/testing only. Then click **Next**.
    The login form displays. Enter your username and password to access the admin interface.
  
### Creating a user

To use the server, it is recommended to create a user. It will have an e-mail address `user@domain.tld` and can be used to configure additional applications.

Go to the admin interface of Yunohost and click **Users** > **New User**. Fill in the required information for the new user:

<Lightbox image={image2} alt="" />

### Installing an application

Yunohost comes with a bunch of pre-packaged applications that can easily be installed on the server with two simple clicks from the management interface. A full list of all available applications is available [here](https://yunohost.org/#/apps).

Install a webmail application to write and read emails of the previously created user directly in a web browser:

1. Go to the admin interface of Yunohost and click **Applications** to land on the applications list:
    <Lightbox image={image3} alt="" />
2. Scroll down to **Roundcube** and click **Install** to install a Webmail client. Fill in the required details for the application and click **Install** to launch the installation of the tool:
    <Lightbox image={image4} alt="" />
3. Once installed go to `yourdomain.tld/webmail` to connect to the Webmail interface to read and write emails:
    <Lightbox image={image5} alt="" />

The basic installation of Yunohost is done now, it is possible to install other applications like a WordPress blog, a torrent application, and much more to have a personal server.
