Cockpit does not support Grafana-managed alerting. It integrates with Grafana to visualize metrics, but alerts are managed through the Scaleway alert manager. You should use Grafana only to define alert rules, not to evaluate or receive alert notifications. Once the conditions of your alert rule are met, the Scaleway alert manager evaluates the rule and sends a notification to the contact points you have configured in the Scaleway console or in Grafana.

This page shows you how to create alert rules in Grafana for monitoring Scaleway resources integrated with Cockpit, such as Instances, Object Storage, and Kubernetes. These alerts rely on Scaleway-provided metrics, which are preconfigured and available in the **Metrics browser** drop-down when using the **Scaleway Metrics data source** in the Grafana interface. This page explains how to use the `Scaleway Metrics` data source, interpret metrics, set alert conditions, and activate alerts.

<Macro id="requirements" />

  - A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
  - Scaleway resources you can monitor
  - [Created Grafana credentials](/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/) with the **Editor** role
  - [Enabled](/cockpit/how-to/enable-alert-manager/) the Scaleway alert manager
  - [Created](/cockpit/how-to/add-contact-points/) a contact point in the Scaleway console or in Grafana (with the `Scaleway Alerting` alert manager of the same region as your `Scaleway Metrics` data source), otherwise alerts will not be delivered

## Switch to data source managed alert rules

Data source managed alert rules allow you to configure alerts managed by the data source of your choice, instead of using Grafana's managed alerting system which is not supported by Cockpit.

1. [Log in to Grafana](/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards/) using your credentials.
2. Click the **Toggle menu** then click **Alerting**.
3. Click **Alert rules** and **+ New alert rule**.
4. In the **Define query and alert condition** section, scroll to the **Grafana-managed alert rule** information banner and click **Switch to data source-managed alert rule**. This step is **mandatory** because Cockpit does not support Grafanaâ€™s built-in alerting system, but only alerts configured and evaluated by the data source itself. You are redirected to the alert creation process.

## Define your metric and alert conditions

Switch between the tabs below to create alerts for a Scaleway Instance, an Object Storage bucket, a Kubernetes cluster pod, or Cockpit logs.

<Tabs id="install">
  <TabsTab label="Scaleway Instance">
    The steps below explain how to create the metric selection and configure an alert condition that triggers when **your Instance consumes more than 10% of a single CPU core over the past 5 minutes.**

    1. Type a name for your alert. For example, `alert-for-high-cpu-usage`.
    2. Select the **Scaleway Metrics** data source.
    3. Click the **Metrics browser** drop-down.
        <Lightbox src="scaleway-metrics-browser.webp" alt="" />
        <Lightbox src="scaleway-metrics-displayed.webp" alt="" />
    4. Select the metric you want to configure an alert for. For example, `instance_server_cpu_seconds_total`.
        <Message type="tip">
         The `instance_server_cpu_seconds_total` metric records how many seconds of CPU time your Instance has used in total. It is helpful to detect unexpected CPU usage spikes.
        </Message>
    5. Select the appropriate labels to filter your metric and target specific resources.
    6. Choose values for your selected labels. The **Resulting selector** field displays your final query selector.
        <Lightbox src="scaleway-metric-selection.webp" alt="" />
    7. Click **Use query** to validate your metric selection.
    8. In the query field next to the **Metrics browser** button, paste the following query. Make sure that the values for the labels you have selected (for example, `resource_id` and `resource_name`) correspond to those of the target resource.
        ```bash
        rate(instance_server_cpu_seconds_total{resource_id="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",resource_name="name-of-your-resource"}[5m]) > 0.1
        ```
    9. In the **Set alert evaluation behavior** field, specify how long the condition must be true before triggering the alert.
    10. Enter a name in the **Namespace** and **Group** fields to categorize and manage your alert, and optionally, add annotations.
    11. Enter a label in the **Labels** field and a name in the **Value** field. You can skip this step if you want your alerts to be sent to the contact points you may already have created in the Scaleway console.
        <Message type="note">
         In Grafana, notifications are sent by matching alerts to notification policies based on labels. This step is about deciding how alerts will reach you or your team (Slack, email, etc.) based on labels you attach to them. Then, you can set up rules that define who receives notifications in the **Notification policies** page.
         For example, if an alert has the label `team = instances-team`, you are telling Grafana to send a notification to the Instances team when your alert `alert-for-high-cpu-usage` gets triggered. Find out how to [configure notification policies in Grafana](/tutorials/configure-slack-alerting/#configuring-a-notification-policy).
        </Message>
    12. Click **Save rule** in the top right corner of your screen to save and activate your alert.
    13. Optionally, check that your configuration works by temporarily lowering the threshold. This will trigger the alert and notify your [contact point](/cockpit/concepts/#contact-points).
  </TabsTab>
  <TabsTab label="Object Storage bucket">
    The steps below explain how to create the metric selection and configure an alert condition that triggers when **the object count in your bucket exceeds a specific threshold**.

    1. Type a name for your alert.
    2. Select the **Scaleway Metrics** data source.
    3. Click the **Metrics browser** drop-down.
        <Lightbox src="scaleway-metrics-browser.webp" alt="" />
        <Lightbox src="scaleway-metrics-displayed.webp" alt="" />
    4. Select the metric you want to configure an alert for. For example, `object_storage_bucket_objects_total`.
        <Message type="tip">
         The `object_storage_bucket_objects_total` metric indicates the total number of objects stored in a given Object Storage bucket. It is useful to monitor and control object growth in your bucket and avoid hitting thresholds.

    5. Select the appropriate labels to filter your metric and target specific resources.
    6. Choose values for your selected labels. The **Resulting selector** field displays your final query selector.
    7. Click **Use query** to validate your metric selection. Your selection displays in the query field next to the **Metrics browser** button. This prepares it for use in the alert condition, which we will define in the next steps.
    8. In the query field, paste the following query. Make sure that the values for the labels you have selected (for example, `resource_id` and `region`) correspond to those of the target resource.
        ```bash
        object_storage_bucket_objects_total{region="fr-par", resource_id="my-bucket"} > 2000
        ```
    9. In the **Set alert evaluation behavior** field, specify how long the condition must be true before triggering the alert.
    10. Enter a name in the **Namespace** and **Group** fields to categorize and manage your alert, and optionally, add annotations.
    11. Enter a label in the **Labels** field and a name in the **Value** field. You can skip this step if you want your alerts to be sent to the contact points you may already have created in the Scaleway console.
