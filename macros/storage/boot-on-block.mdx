macro: storage-boot-on-block

The boot-on-block feature allows Instances to boot from attached [Block Storage](#block-volumes) volumes instead of local volumes. This feature is available for all Instance types. When creating an Instance, you can select Block Storage as a system volume type. This allows you to reboot Instances from the block volume on which your OS is stored.
