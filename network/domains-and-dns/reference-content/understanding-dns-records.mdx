This page provides information about the different DNS record types available with Domains and DNS and how to use them.


Information in DNS zones is categorized and organized through a list of [DNS record](/network/domains-and-dns/concepts/#dns-record) types, called [resource records](/network/domains-and-dns/concepts/#resource-record/) (RRs).

Each of these records has a type, an expiration time (Time to Live - TTL) and a name. Certain types of records also have type-specific data.

## Available records with Domains and DNS

### A record

**A record** stands for **Address record**. It is mostly used to map domain names to the IPv4 address of a specific server. In other words, it allows to connect a domain name to the numerical IP address of a server where the website or online service is hosted.

An A record ensures that when you type a website's name into your browser, your computer knows where to find that website on the internet.

### AAAA record

Just like an A record connects a domain to an IPv4 address, an **AAAA record** does the same thing for the newer IPv6 addresses. It allows devices to locate and communicate with websites and services using the IPv6 protocol.

### ALIAS record

An ALIAS record allows you to associate one domain name with another domain name, without changing the original domain name or the visible URL. Instead of pointing directly to an IP address, an alias record redirects the domain name to another domain name.

An ALIAS record could be useful if you are moving your website to a new domain, as it can seamlessly redirect traffic from the old domain to the new one. This makes sure, visitors can still find and access your website.

### CAA record

**CAA record** stands for **Certification Authority Authorization record**. It allows domain owners to specify which certificate authorities (CAs) are authorized to issue [SSL/TLS certificates](/network/domains-and-dns/concepts/#ssl) for their domain.

This adds an extra layer of security, as it reduces the risk of unauthorized or fraudulent SSL/TLS certificates being issued by untrustworthy certificate authorities.

### CNAME record

**CNAME record** stands for **Canonical name record**. Just like the ALIAS record, a CNAME record points one domain to another, but by using the target domain's actual IP address. Using a CNAME record changes the visible URL.

<Message type="important">
  You must add a **trailing dot** at the end of the domain name you want the CNAME to point to in the **Hostname** field. Otherwise, the CNAME points your domain to a [relative hostname](/network/domains-and-dns/concepts/#relative-hostname). For example, if you want `mydomain.com` to point to `mynewdomain.com`, you **must** write `mynewdomain.com.` in the **Hostname** field. Otherwise, the CNAME record will direct your users to `mynewdomain.com.mynewdomain.com`.
</Message>

The CNAME record refers to a relative or absolute hostname. A relative hostname is indicated by no period (.) at the end of the hostname. An absolute hostname is indicated by the trailing period (.).

### DNAME record

**DNAME record** stands for **Delegation name record**. It is used to redirect from a part of the DNS name tree to another part of the DNS name tree.

### MX record

Mail exchange record, maps a domain name to a list of one or more mail servers for that domain.

### NAPTR record

Naming Authority Pointer record, provides instructions for translating a specific type of data into a different format. NAPTR records help devices and services such as Voice over Internet Protocol systems, find the appropriate servers or services to connect to. They essentially act as a guide, pointing out how to transform certain data to match what is needed for communication or service interaction.

### NS record

Name server record, delegates a DNS zone to use the specified authoritative name servers.

### SRV record

Service record, provides a specification of location data in the Domain Name System (for example: the hostname and port number of servers for specified services). It can be used for specific protocols such as SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)

### TLSA record

TLS Authentication record, used to associate a TLS certificate or public key with the specified domain name. It allows you store the fingerprint of a TLS/SSL certificate in the DNS zone of your domain.

### TXT record

Text record, often used to carry machine-readable data such as information for automated domain validation.
