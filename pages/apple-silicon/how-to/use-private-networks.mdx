Private Networks allow your Mac mini to communicate in an isolated and secure network with other Scaleway resources, away from the public internet. This is an optional-billed feature for Mac mini.

Each Mac mini can be connected to one or several Private Networks, letting you build your own network topologies. Private Networksâ€™ built-in DHCP server manages the allocation of private IP addresses for Mac mini servers (and other resources) when they are attached to the network.
