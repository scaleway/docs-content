Hardening security is a top priority. 

Effective now, every new Kapsule cluster is required a (free) Private Network attached.

Starting this deprecation cycle, existing Kapsule clusters must be connected to a Private Network. 

The default worker nodes isolation configuration will keep public IPs for nodes to access the Internet, and add private endpoints for resources to communicate securely. Security groups aren't overridden at migration and RR wildcard DNS still point to public IPs.

More information on the migration steps provided in [our reference documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/containers/kubernetes/reference-content/secure-cluster-with-private-network/).
