When you create a Redis™<sup>*</sup> Database Instance, you have to specify a user. It will be created with the following permissions:

```
+client +cluster
info +cluster
nodes +cluster
myid +cluster
slots +cluster
shards allkeys
```

<Message type="important">
  The default permissions cannot be edited. It is also not possible to create additional users.
</Message>

You can specify a name for this user when you create a Database Instance via the Scaleway console, the API or the CLI.

This allows you to ensure the username is compatible with different software integrations where specific usernames are not supported.

For a username to be valid, it must:
  - contain only letters, numbers, hyphens, dollars, and underscores
  - be between 1 and 63 characters long
  - not start with `_rkv`
  - start with a letter
  - not be `scalewayadmin` or `metrics`

<Message type="important">
  You can change the default username and password anytime via the Scaleway API or the CLI. Refer to the [Managing the default user's username and password](/managed-databases/redis/api-cli/managing-username-and-password/) documentation page for more information.
