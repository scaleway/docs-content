**Qsim** is a high-performance quantum circuit simulator developed by **Google Quantum AI** (via the QuantumLib initiative). It is designed to simulate quantum circuits on classical hardware with state-of-the-art performance, leveraging advanced techniques like gate fusion and AVX/SSE vectorization.

Scaleway QaaS allows you to scale Qsim beyond your local machine. You can execute your emulated computation on dedicated **CPU** or **GPU** (like Nvidia H100, L40S) seamlessly, benefiting from pre-configured, optimized environments.

## Why use Qsim on Scaleway?

* **Billed at time:** The billing starting time begins only when the Platform is fully operational and the first Job can be executed.
* **Multi-Framework support:** Uniquely, our Qsim platforms are accessible via both **Cirq** (Google's native SDK) and **Qiskit**. You can choose your preferred language while benefiting from the Qsim engine.
* **Extreme performance:** Qsim is optimized for simulating intermediate-scale quantum circuits. When coupled with Scaleway's high-end GPUs, it drastically reduces execution time for deep circuits.
* **Smart compression:** Just like our Aer offerings, the platform automatically compresses circuit data and computation results to optimize network throughput and latency.

## How to access via Cirq (Native)

[Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq) is the native language of Qsim. Using the `cirq-scaleway` adapter allows you to run your Google Cirq circuits directly on our cloud GPUs.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account with a valid **Project ID**
- A Scaleway **API Key** (Secret Key)
- Python and `cirq` installed on your local machine

1. Install the `cirq-scaleway` provider. Refer to the [Cirq Scaleway GitHub repository](https://github.com/scaleway/cirq-scaleway) for more information.

    ```bash
    pip install cirq-scaleway
    ```

2. Create a file with the following computation script. Replace `$SCW_PROJECT_ID` and `$SCW_SECRET_KEY` with your Scaleway Project ID and secret key.

    ```python
    import cirq

    from cirq_scaleway import ScalewayQuantumService

    # 1. Initialize the Provider
    service = ScalewayQuantumService(
        project_id="<$SCW_PROJECT_ID>",
        secret_key="<$SCW_SECRET_KEY>"
    )

    # 2. Get the Qsim platform
    qsim_platform = service.device(name="EMU-QSIM-H100")

    # 3. Create a Circuit (e.g., Bell State)
    # and run in on your dedicated Qsim Session
    with qsim_simulator.create_session() as session:
        qubit = cirq.GridQubit(0, 0)
        circuit = cirq.Circuit(cirq.X(qubit) ** 0.5, cirq.measure(qubit, key='m'))

        result = session.run(circuit)

        print("Result:", result)
    ```
4. Save the script. In this example we save it as `cirq.py`.

5. Run the script.
    ```bash
    python ~/cirq.py
    ```
## How to access via Qiskit

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account with a valid **Project ID**.
- A Scaleway **API Key** (Secret Key).
- Python and `qiskit` installed on your local machine

1. Install the `qiskit-scaleway` provider. Refer to the [Qiskit Scaleway GitHub repository](https://github.com/scaleway/qiskit-scaleway) for more information.

    ```bash
    pip install qiskit-scaleway
    ```

3. Create a file with the following computation script. Replace `$SCW_PROJECT_ID` and `$SCW_SECRET_KEY` with your Scaleway Project ID and secret key.

    ```python
    from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
    from qiskit_scaleway import ScalewayProvider

    # 1. Initialize Provider
    provider = ScalewayProvider(
        project_id="$SCW_PROJECT_ID",
        secret_key="$SCW_SECRET_KEY"
    )

    # 2. Select the Qsim Backend
    # Scaleway bridges the Qiskit circuit to the Qsim engine automatically
    backend = provider.get_backend("EMU-QSIM-H100")

    # 3. Create & Run Circuit
    qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
    qc.h(0)
    qc.cx(0, 1)
    qc.measure_all()

    job = backend.run(qc, shots=1000)

    print("Counts:", job.result().get_counts())
    ```

4. Save the script. In this example we save it as `computation.py`.

5. Run the script.
    ```bash
    python ~/computation.py
    ```
