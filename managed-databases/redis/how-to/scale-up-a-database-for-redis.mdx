<Macro id="iam-requirements" />
 
If you want to scale up the size of your Redis™ Database Instance, you can edit your node settings to either:

  - **Scale vertically**: upgrade to a bigger node type to allow increased traffic for the same endpoint.
  - **Scale horizontally**: add more nodes to your Database Instance to increase your number of endpoints and distribute cache. This setting is only available for Database Instances in cluster mode.

## How to scale vertically

</Message>

1. Click **Redis™** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instances information page.
3. Scroll down the page to the **Node Settings** section.
4. Click **Scale vertically**. A pop-up appears.
5. Select a new node type from the drop-down.
6. Check the details of the estimated cost and click **Scale vertically**.

    You can view the details of your new node type in the Database Instance information page.

## How to scale horizontally

3. Scroll down the page to the **Node Settings** section.
4. Click **Scale horizontally**. A pop-up appears.
5. Set a new total number of nodes.
    <Message type="note">
      The new total number of nodes has to be bigger than your current number of nodes. You can add up to 6 nodes.
    </Message> 
6. Check the details of the estimated cost and click **Scale horizontally**.
    <Message type="note">
      Scaling the number of nodes in your Database Instance can take up to several minutes depending on the number of nodes you select.
    </Message>

    <Message type="note">
      When TLS is enabled, scaling your Database Instance horizontally won't generate a new SSL certificate with additional IPs.
      You have to manually renew the cluster SSL certificate in order to get the new IPs.
    </Message>

  You can check your new number of nodes in the Database Instance information page under **Node configuration**.
