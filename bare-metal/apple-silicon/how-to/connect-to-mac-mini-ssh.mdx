You can connect directly to the terminal of your Mac mini using the SSH protocol and your [SSH key](/console/account/concepts/#ssh-key).

<Macro id="requirements" />
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- A [Mac mini](/bare-metal/apple-silicon/how-to/create-mac-mini/)

## Connecting to a Mac mini using SSH

1. Navigate to the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) and log in with your credentials.

2. Click **Apple silicon** under the **Bare Metal** section in the side-menu. This displays a list of your Mac minis.

4. Open your terminal application and use the SSH command provided on the **Overview** page to connect. 
   - The SSH command will be in the format:
     ```sh
     ssh your_mac_mini_username@<your_mac_mini_ip>
     ```
   - Replace `<your_mac_mini_username>` with your Mac mini username.
   - Replace `<your_mac_mini_ip>` with the actual IP address of your Mac mini.
