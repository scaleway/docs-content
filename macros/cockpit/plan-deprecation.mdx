<Message type="note">

 **Cockpit pricing plans have been deprecated on January 1st 2025** <br /><br />

 The [retention](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#retention) period previously set for your Scaleway and custom logs, metrics and traces remains the same. <br /><br />
 You can change the retention period for your metrics, logs, and traces for free during Beta (starting January 1st 2025). <br /><br />
 Find out [how to change data retention period](/observability/cockpit/how-to/change-data-retention/) in the dedicated documentation.
