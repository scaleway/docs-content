[Rclone](https://rclone.org) is a command-line tool that can be used to manage your cloud storage. It communicates with any S3 compatible cloud storage provider as well as other storage platforms.

Follow the instructions given in the [official Rclone documentation here](https://rclone.org/install/) to install Rclone.

For example, on Linux:

- Connect to your server as `root` via [SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).

- Then, download and install Rclone with the following sequence of commands:
  ```
  wget https://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-current-linux-amd64.zip
  apt install zip
  unzip rclone-current-linux-amd64.zip
  cd rclone*linux-amd64/
  mv rclone /usr/bin/
  ```

## Configuring Rclone

1. Run the following command to begin the Rclone configuration:
    ```
    rclone config
    ```

    If you do not have any existing remotes, the following output displays:
    ```
    2021/01/18 16:03:28 NOTICE: Config file "/root/.config/rclone/rclone.conf" not found - using defaults
    No remotes found - make a new one
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    ```

    If you have previously configured Rclone you may see a slightly different output. However, that does not affect the following steps.
2. Type `n` to make a new remote. You are then prompted to type a name - here we type `remote-sw-paris`:
    ```
    n/s/q> n

    ```

    The following output displays:

    ```

    For more info visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl

    Note that this ACL is applied when server side copying objects as S3

    <Message type="note">
      If you want to be able to transfer data to or from a bucket in a different region to the one you just set up, repeat steps 1-14 again to set up a new remote in the required region. Simply enter the required region at steps 7 and 8. Similarly, you may wish to set up a new remote for a different Object Storage provider.
