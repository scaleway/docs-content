Penpot is an open-source design and prototyping platform designed for cross-domain teams. It is completely web-based and works with open web standards (SVG). Penpot can run in almost any modern browser, regardless of the underlying operating system.

In this tutorial, you learn how to deploy your own Penpot Instance using the Docker [InstantApp](/tutorials/docker-instantapp/).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a Scaleway Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) with a [Docker InstantApp](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers/create?area=fr-par-1&imageKey=c1b530d8-0ca0-45c4-80db-ba06608287b2&offerName=PLAY2-MICRO)
- A domain

## Installing Penpot using Docker Compose

1. Connect to your Instance using [SSH](/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/):
    ```
    ssh root@<docker_instance_ip>
    ```

2. Download the Docker configuration from the Penpot repository:

    ```
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/penpot/penpot/main/docker/images/docker-compose.yaml
    ```

3. Open `docker-compose.yaml` in a text editor:
    ```
    nano docker-compose.yaml
    ```

4. Set the `PENPOT_PUBLIC_URI` to your Penpot domain. Then save the file and exit the editor.
    ```
    PENPOT_PUBLIC_URI=https://penpot.your-domain.com
    ```
5. Update the APT package cache on your system to make sure you have the latest releases available.
    ```
    apt update
    ```

6. Install the Nginx web server and `certbot` using APT. These serve as a frontend for the Penpot application and provide a secured TLS connection by using Let's Encrypt certificates.
    ```
    apt install nginx python3-certbot-nginx
    ```

7. Disable the default virtual host, that is pre-configured when Nginx is installed via Ubuntu’s package manager.
    ```
    unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
    ```

8. Create an Nginx configuration file for the reverse proxy:
    ```
    nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/penpot.conf
    ```

9. Paste the following content into the file. Make sure that you replace `your-domain.com` with your domain. Save the file and exit.
    ```
    server {
            listen 80;
            listen [::]:80;

            server_name  penpot.your-domain.com;

            access_log /var/log/nginx/reverse-access.log;
            error_log /var/log/nginx/reverse-error.log;

            location / {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9001/;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
            proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forward-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forward-Proto http;
            proxy_set_header X-Nginx-Proxy true;
            proxy_redirect off;
        }
    }
    ```
10. Link the configuration file to enable it with Nginx.
    ```
    ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/penpot.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/penpot.conf
    ```
11. Reload Nginx to activate the new configuration:
    ```
    service nginx reload
    ```

## Securing the connection using TLS

1. Log into your domain registrar, access your DNS zone, and add an A record with the following information.
        - Name: `penpot`
        - IP address or Hostname or Value: `<your-instance-public-IPv4-address>`
        - TTL: default

2. Run `certbot`, a tool that automatizes most of the configuration work related to requesting, installing, and managing the TLS certificate:
    ```
    certbot --nginx
    ```
3. Answer the prompts that display on the screen to request a valid Let’s Encrypt TLS certificate:
    ```
    Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
    Plugins selected: Authenticator nginx, Installer nginx
