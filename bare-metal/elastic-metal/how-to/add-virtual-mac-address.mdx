Virtual MAC addresses act as virtual interface identifiers necessary for virtualization. When running multiple virtual machines on a single physical Elastic Metal server, you can configure the [MAC address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address) of the virtual network interface to match the virtual MAC associated with the [flexible IP](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/concepts/#flexible-ip), ensuring network connectivity for the virtual machine.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An installed Elastic Metal server ([how to create an Elastic Metal server](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/quickstart/#how-to-create-an-elastic-metal-server))

<Message type="tip">
  Virtual MAC addresses are only necessary for virtualization. If you plan to configure the flexible IP as a secondary interface on the host OS, a virtual MAC is not required.

1. Click **Elastic Metal** in the **Bare Metal** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Elastic Metal dashboard displays.
2. Click the **Flexible IPs** tab to navigate to flexible IP section. A list of your flexible IPs for Elastic Metal server displays.
3. Click the <Icon name="more" /> next to the flexible IP you wish to configure. The configuration menu for the flexible IP will display.
4. Click **More info** to see detailed information about the IP address.
5. Configure the virtual MAC address:
   - Scroll down to the **MAC address** section and click **Add MAC address**.
   - Select the desired type of virtual MAC address (`VMware`, `XEN`, or `KVM`). It is recommended to choose the type that matches your virtualization technology.
   - Confirm by clicking **Generate MAC Address**.

<Message type="tip">
  If the virtual MAC address is no longer needed, you can remove it from the flexible IP by clicking the **Delete** button.
