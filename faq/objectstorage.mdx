## What is Object Storage?

Object Storage is a service based on the S3 protocol. It allows you to store any kind of objects (documents, images, videos, etc.)

We provide you with a comfortable and integrated UI in the console for convenience. But it is not easy to browse infinite storage from the web, so we came up with some engineering trade-offs:
Bear in mind that some actions are limited in the console for Object Storage. It includes: 

- batch deletion is limited to 1000 objects.
- empty files are not reported as empty folders.

We provide an S3-compatible API for programmatic access or for usage with any compatible software.
Thus, we recommend using dedicated tools like s3cmd to manage large data sets.

You can create a token in the Credentials section of the management console. To connect to Object Storage, use the Access-Key and Secret-Key displayed during token creation.

The Secret-Key is only shown once. Write it down and keep it safe. It cannot be recovered if you lose it.

## How can I monitor my Object Storage consumption?

You can monitor your Object Storage consumption directly from the Scaleway Console. 
Metrics such as storage and bucket usage help you estimate your consumption. For more information, refer to the [documentation](/storage/object/how-to/monitor-consumption/).

## Is there a limitation in the bucket name?

Bucket names must be unique and comply with the following:

- Must not contain uppercase characters or underscores.
- Must not be formatted as an IP address.
- Can contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
- Can contain a set of the 63 alphabetic characters, a to z, and the 10 Arabic numerals, 0 to 9.

For buckets with a name containing a dot (.), users must use the canonical path. The subdomain form, for instance, `https://toto.tata.s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud` will not work as the SSL certificate `*.s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud` is not recursive.

In addition, when using buckets with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the SSL wildcard certificate only matches buckets that do not contain periods. Therefore, it is not recommended to use bucket names with multiple dots, as it will have an impact on accessing your bucket via HTTPS. To avoid this, it is recommended to use **dashes** in your bucket names.

Bucket names are unique in relation to our whole platform. This means **if a bucket exists already in one region, the name cannot be reused in another**.
The `“Bucket already exists”` error message is triggered when the name you intended to use for your bucket is already reserved by another user (or yourself).

<Message type="note">
When deleting a bucket, its name becomes available again. Anybody can reuse it on a first-come, first-served principle.

## Can I use Object Storage as a CDN?

The Object Storage product delivers content for your applications and users from a single point in the region of your choice.
Our platform is designed to deliver very high performance, up to 100 Gbit/sec per bucket per region without performance loss.

If you want to deliver your content to several geographic locations with minimal latency, you can use a CDN caching service such as [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/fr-fr/) or [Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/), using your Object Storage bucket as a backend.

Scaleway does not offer a CDN service yet.

## How can I access my files via HTTPS?
You can access your files via HTTPS by creating a public link from the Scaleway Console:

1. Click **Object Storage** on the side menu. 
2. Click on the bucket which contains the file you want to access. The bucket information page displays.
3. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the file you want to access.
4. Select **Get public link**.
5. Click **Generate link**. Your temporary file public link displays.

## Can I change HTTP headers during upload?

Yes, this is allowed with tools like `s3cmd`, but only cache-control or those prefixed by `x-amz-meta`.

## How can I make an object public?

You can make an object public via the Scaleway Console or the CLI. 

From the Scaleway Console:

1. Click **Object Storage** on the side menu. 
2. Click on the bucket which contains the file you want to access. The bucket information page displays.
3. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the file you want to access.
4. Click **Visibility**
5. Select either **Public** or **Private**
6. Click **Update Object Visibility** to save.

If you upload a file by using the CLI, you can make it public by using the parameter: `--acl public-read`

<Message type="note">
You can only configure the visibility (public or private) of one object at a time. It is not possible to perform this action on an entire bucket, on which visibility is defined by default as private. Allowing public visibility on a bucket only allows the viewing of a list of objects that are stored in the bucket.

For more information, refer to  [S3 Object Storage Operations](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-operations/).

## How can I upload large objects?

Object Storage supports multipart upload. We recommend uploading by chunks, in a limit of 1000 chunks. 

The following technical specifications apply to multipart uploads:

- 1 to 1000 parts per object
- 5 MB to 5 GB per part (except for the last one)
- Each object stores up to 5TB

For more information, refer to the [documentation](/storage/object/api-cli/multipart-uploads/).

## Does my bucket remain available after deletion?

If your bucket has been deleted from the Scaleway console, our teams may, as a last option, be able to retrieve its data the same day it is deleted (excluding weekends). 
Nevertheless, this measure applies on a case by case basis, and is not guaranteed. Please contact technical assistance if you need to recover data from a deleted bucket within this time frame.

If your bucket has been deleted via the API, it is deleted instantly.

## Does Object Storage provide read-after-write consistency?

Yes. Scaleway Object Storage provides `read-after-write` consistency for `PUT` and `DELETE` requests of objects in buckets in all regions. This applies to writes of new objects as well as requests overwriting existing objects and to DELETEs.

`Read-after-write` consistency guarantees that changes are immediately visible (reading data) right after making those changes (writing data), meaning that a newly-created object will be visible immediately, without any delay.
Scaleway Object Storage replicates data across multiple storage systems to achieve high availability. Any read (`GET` or `LIST`) request initiated after a successful PUT request will immediately return the data written by the `PUT` request.

Examples:
- You upload a new object into your bucket and request a listing of the objects in it: The new object will be visible in the list.
- You delete an existing object in your bucket and try to immediately read it. Object Storage will not return any data as the object has been deleted.

## Will closing my web browser after requesting to delete a bucket stop the deletion process?

No. After you click to delete a bucket in the Scaleway console, the request is processed in our backend and it is not dependant on your web browser. For more information on how to delete a bucket, refer to the [documentation](/storage/object/how-to/delete-a-bucket/).

## Can I create a bucket with the same name as that of a previously deleted one?

Yes. If you have deleted a bucket via the web console, you can create a new one with the same name after a delay of 24 hours.

## Is there a quota limit for Object Storage?

Each Scaleway's project can use up to 250TB of Object Storage resources. If you wish to increase your Object Storage quota, contact the Support.

## Your new backend has been deployed since the 27th of January 2022, does the limit of 500k objects still apply for existing buckets?
The new backend will work only with newly created buckets. If you want to avoid the 500k limitation, you must create a new bucket and copy your data to it. 

## Is your new backend available in all regions?
Yes, starting from the 27th of January 2022, the new backend is available in all regions

## Do you plan to migrate our existing bucket?
Not initially. If a migration occurs you will be informed by e-mail.
