This page explains how to manage a secret [version](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#version) using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Generated an API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) and enabled the `SecretManagerFullAccess` [permission set](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/)
- Created a [secret](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/how-to/create-secret/) and one or more [versions](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/how-to/create-version/) for it

1. Click **Secret Manager** in the **Security and Identity** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu.
2. Select the relevant [region](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#region), in the **Region** drop-down.
3. Access the relevant secret. Your secret's **Overview** tab displays.
4. Click the **Versions** tab. The versions of your secret display.
5. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the version you want to manage.
6. Click **Disable** to [disable](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#disabling-a-version) one specific version of your secret.
7. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the version you have disabled, then click **Enable** to [enable](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#enabling-a-version) it.
    <Message type="important">
     Keep in mind that updating a secret's [ephemeral policy](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#ephemeral-policy) impacts the secret's disabled versions when you enable them again.
     If you have created a version with the previous ephemeral policy's settings, disabled the version, and updated the ephemeral policy, the version will inherit its settings from those of the current policy when you enable it again.
    </Message>
8. Click **Copy version's value** to copy the value of your version.
9. Click <Icon name="seeMore" /> to see the value of your version.

<Message type="important">
 Make sure that the version does not have the **Single access** [ephemeral property](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#ephemeral-properties).
