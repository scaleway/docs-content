The Scaleway functions plugin for [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/) allows users to deploy their functions and containers to Scaleway Serverless with a simple `serverless deploy`command.

Serverless Framework handles everything from creating namespaces to function/code deployment by calling APIs endpoint under the hood.

For more information about the Scaleway Serverless Framework plugin, refer to our [dedicated documentation for the Servless plugin](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-scaleway-functions) on the GitHub repository of the project.
