The Scaleway Instances product includes a feature called **automatic network hot-reconfiguration**.

This mechanism automatically configures or deconfigures a [flexible IP address](/instances/concepts/#flexible-ip) in the guest operating system when it is attached to or detached from an Instance.

This guide explains how to enable or disable the automatic network hot-reconfiguration mechanism on your Instance.

## Supported configurations

Before proceeding, ensure that your operating system supports the target network configuration: refer to Scaleway’s compatibility guidelines on [OS images and flexible IP type combinations](/instances/reference-content/comaptibility-scw-os-images-flexible-ip/).

Starting from **October 10th, 2024**, all GNU/Linux-based operating systems and InstantApp images for Scaleway Instances have automatic network hot-reconfiguration enabled by default.

To verify that the feature is active on your Instance, use the following command:

```bash
# systemctl is-active scw-net-reconfig.path
```

If the output is `active`, the feature is enabled and ready to use. If the output is `inactive`, you have to enable it first.


### Enabling network hot-reconfiguration

Follow these steps to enable automatic network hot-reconfiguration on a Scaleway Instance where the feature is currently inactive.

1. Enable the QEMU Guest Agent. Refer to Scaleway’s documentation on [enabling the QEMU Guest Agent (GQA)](/instances/reference-content/understanding-qemu-guest-agent/#opting-in) for further details.

2. Install the latest Scaleway ecosystem package.

   - **Fedora / AlmaLinux / RockyLinux / CentOS**
     ```bash
     # yum -y --best install scaleway-ecosystem
     ```

   - **Debian / Ubuntu**
     ```bash
     # apt-get update
     # apt-get -y install scaleway-ecosystem
     ```

     <Message type="note">
       Ensure you install version `0.0.7-1` or higher of the `scaleway-ecosystem` package.
     </Message>

3. Enable the automatic network reconfiguration mechanism.

   On Debian and Ubuntu systems, the mechanism typically activates automatically after installing or upgrading the `scaleway-ecosystem` package. However, RedHat-based distributions may require a manual start:

   ```bash
   # systemctl enable --now scw-net-reconfig.path
   ```

   <Message type="note">
     Rebooting your Instance will also activate network hot-reconfiguration.
   </Message>

### Disabling network hot-reconfiguration

If you prefer to prevent automatic network reconfiguration when a flexible IP is attached or detached, run the following command:

   ```bash
   # systemctl disable --now scw-net-reconfig.path
   ```
