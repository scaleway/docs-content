Object Storage now supports the highly redundant MultiAZ infrastructure for its Standard class in the Paris region. Built on a Scaleway-designed stack, it takes data redundancy, resiliency &amp; scalability to the next level.

A new storage class is also available in the Paris region: One Zone &#8211; IA (Infrequent Access).

This storage class is a good choice for storing secondary backup copies or easily recreate data.
It can also be integrated into your lifecycle management rules, along with Standard and Glacier classes.

On Buckets created starting January the 27th, you will be able to store billions of objects inside a single bucket without any performance issues.
