To connect to Instances, Elastic Metal servers and Mac mini M1 you need to generate an SSH key for your Project. The advantage of creating and uploading an SSH key to your Project before you start creating resources, is that you are then prompted to associate the uploaded SSH key with the resource during the resource creation. This makes it easier for you to manage SSH access. 

## How to generate an SSH key

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

[SSH keys](/console/my-account/concepts/#ssh-key) allow you to securely connect to your Instances without using a password.

You can generate the SSH key pair on your local machine. The process will depend on your operating system.

### How to generate an SSH key pair on OSX and Linux

On OSX and Linux, you can generate the SSH key pair directly from the terminal (command line).

1. Open the terminal application.
2. Type `ssh-keygen -o -b 4096` and press `Enter` to generate a new key.
    <Message type="important">
      For security reasons you must generate a 2048-bit or 4096-bit RSA key (hence the `-b 4096` part of the command). Older 1024-bit keys are no longer supported. The `-o` option was added in 2014, to specify use of the new OpenSSH format. If the command fails for you, try removing the `-o`.
    </Message>
3. Enter a filepath to save the key to when prompted. Alternatively, press **Enter** to leave this at the default setting (the key will be saved in a file called `id_rsa` in the `~/.ssh` directory).
    ```
    Enter file in which to save the key (~/.ssh/id_rsa):`
    ```
4. Enter a passphrase when prompted. This step is not mandatory, but is recommended for increased security. The passphrase can be freely chosen. If you do not want to set a passphrase, press **Enter** directly.
    ```
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
    ```
5. Enter the passphrase again for confirmation when prompted, and press **Enter**:
    ```
    Enter same passphrase again:
    ```

    The key pair is generated in the filepath you specified. The key pair consists of:
      - The public key, named `id\_rsa.pub`
      - The private (identification) key, named `id\_rsa`
6. Display the content of the public key with the following command and copy it.
    ```
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    ```
7. Copy the content of the public key. You will need this in the next step. Your key should look something like the output shown:
    ```
    ssh-rsa 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 me@localhost
    ```

### How to generate an SSH key pair on Windows

On Windows, you can use the third-party application [PuTTYgen](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) to generate an SSH key pair.

1. Download and install [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) to your local computer. The **PuTTYgen** application is automatically installed (as well as the main PuTTY application).
2. Launch PuTTYgen by double-clicking on the application icon. The following screen displays.

3. Select **RSA**, set the number of bits in the key to **4096** and click the **Generate** button:2. Launch PuTTYgen by double-clicking on the application icon. The following screen displays.

3. Select **RSA**, set the number of bits in the key to **4096** and click the **Generate** button:  <Lightbox src="scaleway-puttygen-randomness.gif" alt="" />

    The public and private keys are generated and the following screen displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-puttygen-screen2.webp" alt="" />
5. Complete the steps on the screen to finish:
    - Fill in the **Key-comment** field with a name to help you identify this key pair
    - Click the **Save public key** button and save it in the folder of your choice
    - Click **Save private key** and save it in the same folder
    - Select the content of the public key (the sequence of characters under "Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file"). Copy it, as you will need this in the next step.

### How to upload the public SSH key to your Scaleway Project

You must upload the content of the public part of the SSH key pair you just created to the Scaleway interface. This is then associated with your Project, and can be transferred to your Instances during the boot process.

1. From the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com), navigate to the [Credentials](/console/my-project/concepts/#ssh-key) tab of your Project Dashboard.
2. Scroll down to the **SSH Key** section, and click **Add a new SSH key**.
3. Paste the content of the public key (which you copied in the previous step) into the pop-up box, and optionally add a description. Then click **Add an SSH key**.

    You will now be able to [connect to your Instances via SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/)

## How to add resources to your Project

To add a new [resource](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#resource) to your project, first ensure you are currently editing the correct Project. 

1. Click **Project Dashboard** in the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu to check if you are logged in the correct Project. 
2. You can also check if the name of your project appears in the **Selected Project** dropdown menu. 
3. Select the resource you want to create from the console side menu.
4. Click the resource and follow deployment instructions. 

    Once the resource is created, it is automatically included in your Project.
