- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## Problem

The amount billed does not correspond to the objects that are present in my Scaleway Object Storage bucket.

## Possible causes

- Your [bucket is versioned](/object-storage/how-to/use-bucket-versioning/), and multiple versions of your objects are stored in it, incurring extra cost.

- Some [multipart uploads](/object-storage/api-cli/multipart-uploads/) are ongoing. The storage used during the upload is billed, but the object is not visible as long as the upload is not complete.

## Possible solutions

### Bucket versioning

1. Check the versioning status of your bucket via the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/object-storage/buckets), or using the [GetBucketVersioning](/object-storage/api-cli/bucket-operations/#getbucketversioning) command:
    ```
    aws s3api get-bucket-versioning --bucket BucketName
    ```
    - If the versioning is `disabled`, the issue is not linked to versioning.
    - If the versioning is `enabled` or `suspended`, you may have multiple versions of your objects.
2. Use the [ListObjectVersions](/object-storage/api-cli/bucket-operations/#listobjectversions) command to list the versions of the objects in your bucket:
    ```bash
    aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket BucketName
    ```
    A list of all the objects versions and delete markers present in the bucket appears.
3. Delete the unwanted versions and delete markers using the [DeleteObject] command with a versionId specified:
    ```bash
    aws s3api delete-object --bucket BucketName --key ObjectName --version-id ObjectVersion
    ```
Refer to the [official Amazon S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/versioning-workflows.html) for more information on how versioning works.

### Multipart uploads

1. Check if some multipart uploads are ongoing using the [ListMultipartUpload](/object-storage/api-cli/multipart-uploads/#listing-multipart-uploads) command:
    ```bash
    list-multipart-uploads --bucket BucketName
    ```
    A list of ongoing multipart uploads displays.

2. Abort the unwanted multipart uploads via the [Scaleway console](/object-storage/how-to/abort-incomplete-mpu/), or [using the CLI](/object-storage/api-cli/multipart-uploads/).

3. Optionally, you can [set up lifecycle rules](/object-storage/how-to/manage-lifecycle-rules/) to automatically abort incomplete multipart uploads after a given duration.

## Going further


- If you did not manage to identify the error and solve it by yourself, [open a support ticket](/account/how-to/open-a-support-ticket/), and provide as many details as possible, along with the necessary information below:
    - Object Storage Endpoint (e.g. `s3.fr-par.scw.cloud`)
    - Bucket name
    - Object name (if the request concerns an object)
    - Request type (PUT, GET, etc.)
    - HTTP status code
    - Date and time (timestamp)
    - User-agent (SDK, client, console, etc.)
    - Transaction ID (if possible)
    - Log / trace of the error (if possible)
