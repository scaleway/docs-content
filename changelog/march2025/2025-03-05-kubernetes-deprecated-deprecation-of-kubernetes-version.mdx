This simultaneous deprecation aligns with our updated 14-month support policy introduced with version 1.29, ensuring users leverage actively supported versions with the latest features and security enhancements.

Clusters still running these versions should be upgraded to a supported minor version as soon as possible. For further details, refer to our [version support policy](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/kubernetes/reference-content/version-support-policy/).
