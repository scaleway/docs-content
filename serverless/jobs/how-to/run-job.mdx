This page shows you how to manually run a Serverless Job from the Scaleway console. You can also run a Serverless Job with contextual options that only apply to one run.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)

## How to run a job

    - A unique identifier
    - A start date and an end date
    - The duration of the job execution
