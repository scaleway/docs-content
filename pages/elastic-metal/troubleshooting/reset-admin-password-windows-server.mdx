During the installation or reinstallation of an Elastic Metal server with a Windows Server operating system, an administrator password is set by you (Administrator account).

If you have lost this password, you can reset it via rescue mode. This guide explains the steps to securely reset the Administrator password and regain access to your server.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An Elastic Metal server [installed](/elastic-metal/quickstart/#how-to-create-an-elastic-metal-server)

## Removing the old Administrator password

1. Reboot your Elastic Metal server into [rescue mode](/elastic-metal/how-to/use-rescue-mode/).
2. Log into rescue mode.
3. Install the packages `ntfs-3g` and `chntpw` using the APT package manager.
    ```sh
    sudo apt install ntfs-3g chntpw
    ```
4. Mount the Windows system partition.
    ```sh
    sudo ntfsfix /dev/sda2
    ```
5. List the user accounts configured in Windows:
    ```sh
    sudo chntpw -l /mnt/Windows/System32/config/SAM
    ```
    An output similar to the following displays:
    ```
    chntpw version 1.00 140201, (c) Petter N Hagen
    Hive </mnt/Windows/System32/config/SAM> name (from header): <\SystemRoot\System32\Config\SAM>

      The administrator account of your server can either be `Administrator` or `Administrateur` depending on the installation.
    </Message>
6. Edit the `Administrator` account by running the following command:
    ```sh
    sudo chntpw -u Administrator /mnt/Windows/System32/config/SAM
    ```
    A menu displays as follows:
    ```

    ```
8. Type `q` and press `Enter` to quit. A summary of the edited files displays:
    ```
    Hives that have changed:
    #  Name

    Write hive files? (y/n) [n] :
    ```
9. Type `y` and press `Enter` to confirm the writing of the files.
    ```
    Write hive files? (y/n) [n] : y

    ```
10. Reboot the server back into [normal mode](/elastic-metal/how-to/use-rescue-mode/#rebooting-back-to-normal-mode).

## Setting a new Administrator password

1. [Activate remote access](/elastic-metal/how-to/activate-remote-access/) on your server to connect via the KVM over IP device.
2. Open the remote console to access the screen output.
3. Open the start menu and select the `Administrator` username to access user settings.
4. Click the password panel, then **Add** to create a new password.
5. Enter the new password, confirm it, and set a reminder.
6. Exit the remote console.
    You can now log into your server using the Remote Desktop Viewer and the new password.
