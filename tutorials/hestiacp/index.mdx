[HestiaCP](https://www.hestiacp.com/) is an open-source control panel that provides easy-to-use web and command line interfaces that allow web server administrators to manage domain names, web spaces, mail accounts and DNS zones from a centralized location with ease and without the need to manually edit configuration files.

The project is a fork of the existing Vesta control panel and is currently in active development. It has a large base of contributors on its [GitHub](https://github.com/hestiacp/hestiacp/) repository. The software is published under the [GPLv3](https://github.com/hestiacp/hestiacp/blob/master/LICENSE) license.

In this Tutorial you will learn how to install and configure HestiaCP on Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver).
