The Bucket Website feature allows you to host [static websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) using Scaleway [Object Storage](https://www.scaleway.com/en/object-storage/). 

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your API keys](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
  - You have [created an Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)
</Message>

<Message type="important">
  To use the bucket website feature, you need to enable it on the bucket or buckets you wish to host your website on.
</Message>

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the name of the bucket you wish to host your website on.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-object-storage-dashboard.webp" alt="" />
3. Scroll down to the bottom of the **Bucket settings** tab and click **Enable bucket website**. A pop-up appears.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-enable-bucket-website.webp" alt="" />
4. Click the <Icon name="toggle" /> icon to enable the feature.
5. Enter the names of the **index** and **error** files of your website that will be uploaded to the bucket.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-website-settings.webp" alt="" />
    The **index** and **error** files are commonly named `index.html` and `error.html`, respectively. You may have already uploaded these files to your bucket, or you can upload them later. Either way, their names must be specified now.

    <Message type="tip">
      - The index file is the default or home page for the website. It serves as an index to the other pages of the site.
      - The error file defines the page that displays in case of an error, for example if a user tries to access a page of your website that does not exist.

    Here is an example of the contents of a basic `index.html` file:

      ```html
      <!doctype html>
      <html>
        <head>
          <title>My Website</title>
        </head>
        <body>
          <div id="main">
              <h1>Hi! Welcome to my website.</h1>
          </div>
        </body>
      </html>
      ```

    Here is an example of the contents of a basic `error.html` file:

      ```html
      <!doctype html>
      <html>
        <head>
          <title>Oops!</title>
        </head>
        <body>
          <div id="main">
              <h1>Oops! Something went wrong.</h1>
          </div>
        </body>
      </html>
      ```

    </Message>

    A warning message informs you that:

    <Message type="important">
      When Bucket Website is enabled, a default [bucket policy](/storage/object/concepts/#bucket-policy) is applied. All objects in the bucket then become publicly visible. You can create your own bucket policy to change the visibility settings [via CLI](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/).
    </Message>
6. Click **Save configuration** to confirm. The details of your website configuration display. 

    Now you can upload the **index** and the **error** files to your bucket, if you haven't already done so, as well as the other files that make up your static website.

    <Message type="note">
      If this is your first time uploading objects into a bucket, you can follow the step-by-step on [this documentation page](/storage/object/how-to/upload-files-into-a-bucket/).
    </Message>
7. Access the website by clicking the **Website URL**.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-update-settings.webp" alt="" />

    <Message type="note">
      You can also [configure a CNAME record](/tutorials/s3-customize-url-cname/) for your bucket URL, to be able to access the website through a domain name of your choice.
