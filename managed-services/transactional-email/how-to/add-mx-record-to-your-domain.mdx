Setting up an [MX record](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#mx-record) ensures that your emails are delivered reliably. This page explains how to set up **your own MX record**, and how to set up Scaleway's blackhole MX if you do not have your own MX server.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />
 
<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/).
  - You have a domain name.
  - You have [configured your domain with Transactional Email](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/configure-domain-with-transactional-email).
  - You have [added SPF and DKIM records](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/add-spf-dkim-records-to-your-domain/) to your domain.
</Message>

## How to add your own MX record

<Message type="important">
  We recommend you use your own MX server if you have one. If you do not have an MX server, we recommend you use Scaleway's blackhole MX, as it allows you to avoid email rejection. However, this also means that the emails sent back to the Scaleway blackhole MX, will be lost and unrecoverable.
</Message>

1. Add an [MX record](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#mx-record) type in the root zone of your domain on your DNS zone.
2. Enter a name of your choice in the **Name** field.
3. Set `10` as a [priority](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#priority) for your MX record.
    <Message type="note">
     Priority indicates the order in which your mail servers should be tried by a mail server that is attempting to deliver emails.
    </Message>
4. Enter the name of your MX followed by a trailing dot in the **Hostname** field.
5. Save your changes.

## How to add Scaleway's MX record

<Message type="important">
  - Scaleway provides its own MX server to improve email deliverability. <br></br> However, Scaleway's MX server is a **blackhole**. This means that **any email sent back to it, will be lost with no possibility of recovery**.
  - If you have no MX server, we recommend you use Scaleway's blackhole MX to avoid getting your emails rejected.
