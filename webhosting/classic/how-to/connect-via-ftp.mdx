**F**ile **T**ransfer **P**rotcol is a standard way to transfer files between a client (such as your local computer) and a server (such as your Scaleway webhosting server). This documentation shows you how to use the popular anf free FTP client [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) to transfer files from your local computer to your Scaelway webhosting server. The process differs slightly depending on your operating system.

In our example, we consider your domain name to be `example.com` and your FTP account to be `webmaster@example.com`

    The FileZilla website detects your operating system, and suggests the correct version of the FileZilla client to download.

3. Click **Download FileZilla Client** and follow the on-screen prompts to complete installation.

<Message type="tip">

Depending on your operating system, you may prefer to download FileZilla from the command line of your terminal. On Linux Ubuntu, use the command `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install filezilla`.
