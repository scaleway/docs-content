This page shows how to create a [Public Gateway](/network/vpc/concepts#public-gateway). Public Gateways sit at the border of private networks and provide extra functionality. They provide services to automate the allocation of private IP addresses ([DHCP](/network/vpc/concepts#dhcp)), and deal with traffic entering and exiting the network ([NAT](/network/vpc/concepts#nat)). You can add a Public Gateway to each of your private networks.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 

    - Choose an **Availability Zone**, which is the geographical location in which your Public Gateway will be created. Note that in order to attach a Public Gateway to a Private Network, they must be in the same Availability Zone.
    - Choose a **Public Gateway Type**, which impacts the pricing and bandwidth of your gateway.
    - Choose an **IP**. You can choose to assign one of your existing Flexible IPs to your Public Gateway. Otherwise, a new IP will be automatically assigned here. 
    - Choose **Name** for your Public Gateway, and (optionally) a description and tags.
    - Verify the **Estimated Cost** of your Public Gateway, based on the specifications you chose.

4. Click **Create a Public Gateway** to finish. 

Your Public Gateway is created and you are redirected to the **Public Gateways** dashboard, where your newly-created Public Gateway now displays.
