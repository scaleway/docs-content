## Manual SQL backup and restore fails

### Problem

When creating or restoring backup manually (i.e. via SQL Administration tools such as pgAdmin, or directly via SQL commands), some errors may occur.

### Cause

These issues are caused by using `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` versions that are not compatible with PostgreSQL 16 (on which Serverless SQL Databases rely).

### Solution

To solve these issues, upgrade your `pg_dump` and/or `pg_restore` modules:

- You can upgrade them by installing PostgreSQL 16 which includes these tools.
- If you are using a third-party tool that includes these libraries, upgrade your tool. For instance, pgAdmin supports PostgreSQL 16 ecosystem from version 7.8.
