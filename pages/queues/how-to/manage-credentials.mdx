Credentials give their bearer (e.g. services and platforms) access to your Queues service. 

This page shows how to manage [credentials](/queues/concepts/#credentials) for Scaleway Queues. Credentials can be updated to change their permissions, or revoked entirely. Once credentials are revoked, any user trying to use the credentials to connect to the service will be denied.
