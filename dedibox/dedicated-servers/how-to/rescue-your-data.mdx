  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net)
  - You have [created](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/order-a-server) and [installed](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/install-a-server) a dedicated server

</Message>

Whatever your operating system (Windows or Linux), if your server does not have a hardware failure, you can recover your files via the rescue mode.

## How to boot into rescue mode

Start your server in rescue mode (emergency system) via your [Dedibox console](/ddedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/use-rescue-mode).
Wait until your machine has become available (it takes 5 to 15 minutes depending on the servers hardware)

Log into your server:
* Either using [PuttY](http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe) on computers running [Windows](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/connect-to-server/#from-windows)
* Or using the `ssh` command directly from a terminal on computers runnig [Linux or macOS](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/connect-to-server/#from-osx-(mac)-and-linux).

<Message type="tip">

The credentials (username and password) to log into the rescue system are displayed in your Dedibox console.

## How to gain root rights

You are connected to your Dedibox via a regular user account, therefore you do not have rights to execute all required commands.
This is the philosophy of Ubuntu, S root account to get the right to do what we want.

<Message type="important">

Changing into the root user implies that you can perform unsafe practices such as deleting files.
Perform these commands your own risk.

</Message>


1. Switch into the `root` account by typing the following command, then press enter:

  ```
  sudo su
  ```

2. Enter the password of the rescue user, displayed in the console and confirm by pressing enter. 

  <Message type="tip">

  For security reasons, the password will not be shown when you type it.

## How to mount the partitions

To have access to your data using the rescue moude, you have to mount your partitions.
If this step passes, then you are almost sure to be able to recover your files.

Mount your partitions using the script available by typing, as `root` user, the command `mountall.sh`.  
The partitions are then mounted in the `/mnt` directory

<Message type="note">

You will notice some errors, the swap cannot be mounted, and many partitions do not exist. This is normal and you do not have to worry about it.

## How to recover your data


Depending on your level of knowledge, you can select your files, or even delete everything, you do what you want.

###  How to resuce your data on Dedibackup
Here we will show you how to retrieve ALL the contents of your disk (including all partitions) on your [Dedibackup]() storage space.

1. Install an FTP client that will work by itself, and `screen` that allows it run it without your computer having to stay on with putty open.

  ```
  apt -y install screen lftp
  ```

2. Launch `screen` bt typing the following command. Then press enter to launch the application:

  ```
  screen
  ```

3. Lauch the transfer of your data by running the following command:

  ```
  lftp -u YOUR_DEDIBACKUP_LOGIN,YOUR_DEDIBACKUP_PASSWORD dedibackup.online.net -e "mirror --reverse /mnt /; exit"
  ```

  * `YOUR_DEDIBACKUP_LOGIN` has to be replaced with your dedibackup login (typically sd- your server number).
  * `YOUR_DEDIBACKUP_PASSWORD` has to be replaced with your dedibackup password.

  <Message type="tip">

  If you do not know the password, change it in the console in order to know it.

  </Message>

Now, if all went well, all your files should be copying to your dedibackup space.
You will be able to browse and retrieve them with any ftp client by connecting to dedibackup via an FTP client.

### Hox to backup to your personal PC (via SFTP)

The recovery mode supports by default the connection using SSH, it is therefore possible to connect from your computer using a SFTP client to recover your files.

In this example we use the client [FileZilla](en/web/web-hosting/tutorials/ftp/configure-filezilla)

To connect to the server, you are required to fill the follwoing values:

*  **Host**: The servers IP address
*  **Identifier**: The user name used to connect to the server
*  **Password**: The password of the recovery system
*  **Port**: Port 22

<Message type="tip">

These details are available in your console once the recovery mode is launched.

##### Configuration example

<Lightbox src="sftp.png"  alt="" /> 


Your data is located in the folders `/mnt`, and `/sda1`, or `/sda`.

You can download your data before a reinstallation or the transfer on another server.

If you do not feel able / do not have time to do these manipulations, you can contact a [certified outsourcer](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/outsourcing/) to perform these tasks for you.
