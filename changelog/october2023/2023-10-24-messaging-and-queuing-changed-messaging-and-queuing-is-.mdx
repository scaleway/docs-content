Messaging and Queuing is Scaleway's message broker solution that allows you to send messages and trigger events between your cloud resources.

The service supports 3 protocols: NATS, SQS and SNS (the latter is still in Public Beta). Messaging and Queuing is serverless-based, so you can run it without worrying about provisioning and you only pay for what you use.

The Messaging and Queuing features are available via the Scaleway console, the CLI and Terraform.

Your existing resources will need to be [migrated](/serverless/messaging/reference-content/migration/), as communicated to all beta users. 

Find out about Messaging and Queuing in our [dedicated documentation](/serverless/messaging/quickstart/). If you have any questions, reach out to the team on the #messaging-queuing community Slack channel.
