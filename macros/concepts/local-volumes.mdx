macro: local-volumes

The local volume of an Instance is an all-SSD-based storage solution, using a RAID array for redundancy and performance, hosted on the local hypervisor. On Scaleway Instances, the size of the local volume is fixed and depends on the Instance type. Some Instance types do not use local volumes and [boot directly on block volumes](#boot-on-block). In any case, it is always possible to increase the storage of an Instance by adding extra block volumes.
