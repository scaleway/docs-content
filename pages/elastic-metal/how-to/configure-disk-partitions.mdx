import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'


Scaleway Elastic Metal servers come with a default partition layout designed for most users, optimizing installation speed and ease of use.
However, if you have specific requirements, you can define a custom partition layout. Partitioning can be configured using either a simplified visual interface or an advanced JSON configuration during server installation.

<Message type="tip">
    You can change the partitioning of your server only during installation or reinstallation.
    Be aware that all data will be deleted if you reinstall your server.
</Message>


<Requirements />
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An [Elastic Metal server](/elastic-metal/quickstart/#how-to-create-an-elastic-metal-server)

<Message type="important">
  Custom partitioning of an Elastic Metal server is only possible if:
  - The server configuration includes faster installation and custom partitioning.
  - It is done during the first installation or a reinstallation.
  - Once installed, partitioning cannot be changed without a reinstallation.
</Message>

## Simplified partitioning (visual interface)

During [server installation](/elastic-metal/how-to/install-server/), navigate to step 5 of the creation wizard and click **Custom Configuration** > **Simplified Partitioning**.

- Enable or disable partitions for SWAP and the secondary `/data` partition by selecting or deselecting checkboxes.
- Define the mount point for the secondary `/data` partition as needed.

This method is ideal for users who prefer a simplified setup without manually specifying partition details.

## Advanced JSON partitioning

For users requiring granular control, Scaleway offers an advanced partitioning method using JSON.

1. During [server installation](/elastic-metal/how-to/install-server/), navigate to step 5 and click **Custom Configuration** > **Advanced JSON**.
2. Edit the partition schema directly in the browser-based editor.
3. Use JSON to define disk partitions, RAID arrays, and file systems.

<Message type="important">
    - Disk Type Naming: HDD/SSD devices use `/dev/sdXXX`, while NVMe devices use `/dev/nvmeXXX`.
    - UEFI Partition: The EFI partition should only exist if the server uses UEFI. Omit this partition if UEFI is not used.
    - ZFS and LVM: ZFS is optional, but LVM should not be used due to functionality issues.
</Message>

### Example JSON configuration

<Message type="tip">
    Refer to the [Elastic Metal API documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/elastic-metal/#path-partitioning-schemas-get-default-partitioning-schema) for valid file system types, RAID configurations, and partitioning parameters.

## Explanation of key sections:

- Disks:
    - Each disk is specified with its device path (e.g., `/dev/nvme0n1` or `/dev/nvme1n1`).
    - Partitions are defined with labels. The default value is `unknown_partition_label`, and possible values are: `uefi`, `legacy`, `root`, `boot`, `swap`, `data`, `home`, `raid`. Refer to the [API documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/elastic-metal/#path-servers-install-an-elastic-metal-server) for full details.
    - Each partition has a `number` and `size` in bytes.

- RAID (Optional):
    - If RAID is required, declare the disks and the desired RAID level. In this example, we are configuring two RAID-1 arrays, one for the boot partition and one for the root partition.
    - Devices participating in each RAID array are specified by their partition paths (e.g., `/dev/nvme0n1p3` for partition 3 of the first NVMe disk).

- File systems:
    - Each partition is assigned a file system type and a mount point.
    - For example, the `/boot/efi` partition is formatted with `fat32`, while `/boot` and `/` are formatted with `ext4`.

- ZFS (Optional):
    - ZFS can be configured if wished. In this example, a ZFS mirror is created using partitions from two NVMe devices.
    - ZFS options such as `ashift=12` can be included for performance tuning, but they are optional.

### Simple configuration (No RAID or ZFS)

If you prefer a simpler configuration without RAID or ZFS, you can remove the `raids` and `zfs` sections. For example, if you only need a single disk setup with no RAID, declare just one disk with the partitions and file systems as shown below:

```json
{
    "partitioning_schema": {
        "disks": [
            {
                "device": "/dev/nvme0n1",
                "partitions": [
                    {
                        "label": "swap",
                        "number": 1,
                        "size": 4294967296
                    },
                    {
                        "label": "boot",
                        "number": 2,
                        "size": 536870912
                    },
                    {
                        "label": "root",
                        "number": 3,
                        "size": 64424509440
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "filesystems": [
            {
                "device": "/dev/nvme0n1p2",
                "format": "ext4",
                "mountpoint": "/boot"
            },
            {
                "device": "/dev/nvme0n1p3",
                "format": "ext4",
                "mountpoint": "/"
            }
        ],
        "raids": [],
        "zfs": null,
        "lvm": null
    }
}
```
