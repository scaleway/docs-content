[MinIO Client](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html) (`mc`) is a command-line tool that allows you to manage your s3 projects, providing a modern alternative to UNIX commands.

1. Follow the instructions given in the [official MinIO documentation](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html#id2) to install the MinIO client (`mc`) for your OS.
    <Message type="note">
    Make sure that you download the binary somewhere that is in your `$PATH`.
    </Message>
2. Run `mc --help` to make sure it was properly installed.
3. Follow the instructions in the [MinIO quickstart guide](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html#id2) to add a cloud storage service:
    ```
    mc alias set <ALIAS> <YOUR-S3-ENDPOINT> <YOUR-ACCESS-KEY> <YOUR-SECRET-KEY> --api <API-SIGNATURE>
    ```
    For example, if your Scaleway Object Storage endpoint is in the `nl-ams` region, you can use the following command (replace the two fields in pointy brackets with your access key and secret key):
    ```
    mc alias set s3 https://s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud <YOUR-ACCESS-KEY> <YOUR-SECRET-KEY> --api S3v4
    ```
    <Message type="tip">
    You can create an alias for each [region](/storage/object/concepts/#region-and-availability-zone/) in which you manage Object Storage resources.
    </Message>
4. You should now be able to run some basic commands, e.g.:
    - List all your buckets at the endpoint you configured in the previous step, via:
        ```
        mc ls s3
        ```

    - List all objects in a given bucket, via:
        ```
        mc ls s3/<your-bucket-name>
        ```

    - Remove an object from a bucket, via:
        ```
        mc rm s3/<your-bucket-name>/1.pdf
        ```

    And all commands detailed via `mc --help`.
