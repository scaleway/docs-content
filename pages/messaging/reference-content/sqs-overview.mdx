## What is Scaleway Queues?

Scaleway Queues is a managed message queuing service that enables decoupling of components within distributed applications. It allows applications to send, queue, store and receive messages between each other asynchronously. Scaleway Queues leverages the SQS protocol.

## What is SQS?

SQS is a managed messaging service developed by AWS and leveraged by Scaleway Queues. 

SQS (Simple Queue Service) became generally available in 2006. It is a highly scalable [queuing](/messaging/concepts#queuing) service that facilitates the decoupling of software systems. Scaleway Queues provides a gateway that enables you to connect your existing applications without having to significantly modify your code baseline.

<Message type="note">
  Some SQS features are not yet supported. Refer to our [dedicated documentation page](/messaging/reference-content/sqs-support/) for more information.

## Scaleway Queues credentials

You must [create credentials](/messaging/how-to/create-credentials/) to give your applications permission to connect to the Scaleway Queues service.

Credentials are scoped to your Scaleway Queues service at [Project](/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project)-level. You can choose to give each set of credentials the required level of permissions:

  - **Read**: receive messages from queues and topics.
  - **Write**: send messages to queues and publish in topics.
  - **Manage**: create or edit resources (such as queues and topics).

## Queues

You can [create queues](/messaging/how-to/create-manage-queues/) via the Scaleway console. You can choose to create either a Standard or FIFO queue, and tweak parameters such as visibility timeout, message retention period, maximum message size and content based deduplication.

## Further actions

All further actions such as sending messages can be done using the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs. Check out our documentation to help you get started with the [AWS CLI](/messaging/api-cli/connect-aws-cli/) or [AWS SDKs](/messaging/api-cli/python-node-sqs/).
