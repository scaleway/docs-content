import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'


Scaleway [Elastic Metal](https://www.scaleway.com/en/elastic-metal/) allows you to order dedicated servers on-demand, similar to cloud Instances. These servers are ideal for large workloads, big data, and applications requiring enhanced security and dedicated resources.

If you ordered your server without a preinstalled operating system, you can install an OS once the Elastic Metal server is delivered to your account.

<Requirements />
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An [Elastic Metal server](/elastic-metal/quickstart/#how-to-create-an-elastic-metal-server)

<Message type="tip">
  This procedure is not necessary if you preinstalled an OS on your Elastic Metal server during its creation.

1. Click **Elastic Metal** in the **Bare Metal** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Elastic Metal dashboard displays.
2. Click **Install** next to the server you want to install. The server installation wizard displays.
3. Complete the server installation wizard:
    - Choose an OS to run on your server or opt for custom installation.
    - Configure server partitioning. You can either choose a default configuration or [configure your own partitioning](/elastic-metal/how-to/configure-disk-partitions/).
    - Enter a name and, optionally, add tags to identify your server.
    - Add your SSH key (required if installing an image on your server). Depending on the OS image, you may also be asked to configure the panel user for your server.
4. Click **Install server** to begin the installation process.
   <Message type="note">
      The OS installation can take up to one hour. You will be able to access the machine once the installation is complete.

To view more details about your server, click its name in the Elastic Metal servers list. This will display detailed information about the machine, including its IP address, labels, and description.
