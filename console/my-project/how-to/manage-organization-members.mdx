A list of the members that belong or have been invited to an [Organization](/console/my-account/concepts/#organization) is available in the [**Members** tab of the Organization page](https://console.scaleway.com/account/organization/users).

[Owners](/console/my-account/concepts/#owner) and [Administrators](/console/my-account/concepts/#administrator) can add members and check information such as the date of their last login and whether their multifactor authentication is activated, but only the Owner can delete or change the role of a member.

## How to invite Members 

Users can be added to Organizations through the Scaleway console in two ways:

1. **Option 1**: On the **Organization Account** page, click **+ Add user**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-add-user-on-orga-account-page.webp" alt="" />

    **Option 2**: On the Members tab, click <Icon name="plus" />.

    In both cases a pop-up requesting the emails and roles of new users displays.
2. Enter the email addresses of the users you wish to invite. 
    <Message type="important">
      If you invite more than one user make sure the corresponding email addresses are separated by a line break. 
    </Message>
3. Select a role for the user(s) in the drop down menu and click **Add User(s)** to confirm.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-add-user-pop-up.webp" alt="" />

An invitation will automatically be sent to the listed email addresses. 

## How to manage Member invitations

Owners and Administrators can manage invitations sent to members on the Members tab.

1. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Send invitation again** next to the Member name on the Member list.
2. Click the **Send Invitation** button to send a new invitation to the selected user.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-send-invite-again.webp" alt="" />

You can also cancel an invitation before it is accepted by clicking <Icon name="more" /> > **Cancel Invitation**.

## How to edit Member Roles

<Message type="important">
  Only the Owner of an Organization can edit Member Roles. 
</Message>

1. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Edit Role** next to the Member name on the Member list.
2. Choose a role in the dropdown menu. 
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-edit-role-dropdown.webp" alt="" />
3. Click **Edit Role** to confirm.
    <Message type="important">
      The sole member whose role cannot be edited is the Owner. 
      Consequently, the ownership of an Organization cannot be transferred to another member.
    </Message>

## How to delete a Member 

<Message type="important">
  Only the Owner of an Organization can delete Members. 
</Message>

    The user will disappear from the members list.
