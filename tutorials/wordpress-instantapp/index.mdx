  The WordPress InstantApp comes with the following packages:
  ```
  nginx
  mysql-server
  php-cli
  php-fpm
  php-mysql
  pwget
  ```
  The underlying operating system used is Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa), so the package versions are those available on this distribution.

WordPress is a popular, free and open source blogging tool and a content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL.

Working with the WordPress application will significantly save you time and effort as WordPress is installed and configured.


## Auto-install functionality

The Wordpress image comes with a new `auto-install` functionality which allows you to create a Wordpress Instance using a few well-defined tags.  
Tags allow you to provide basic information needed to have a fully working Wordpress Instance. 

To trigger the auto-install functionality, two mandatory tags are required for full automation: 

- `admin_user_name`
- `admin_email`

Optional tags such as `weblog_title`and `language` can also be used to add more customization to the Weblog. 

<Message type="note">
  The value for the `language` tag must adhere to the [list of Wordpress locale codes](https://wpastra.com/docs/complete-list-wordpress-locale-codes)
</Message>

A random password will be generated and will be accessible when you log into your Instance with your SSH key.
When defining the `weblog_title` tag on the console, it is not possible to have spaces in the title of the weblog. This is only feasible when using the CLI. Refer to our tutorial on [creating a Wordpress Instance using the Scaleway CLI](/tutorials/create-wordpress-instances-cli) to create an Instance with the Scaleway CLI.
