As part of our ongoing effort to improve platform security, Redis has been uninstalled from the cPanel platforms. This decision was made due to Redis being a high-privilege service that is not required for the majority of our users, and which may pose security risks if misconfigured or exposed.

For Web Hosting users who rely on Redis, we recommend migrating to Scaleway Managed Database for Redis.
