**Aer** is the high-performance emulator framework for the Qiskit software stack. It provides powerful backends to emulate quantum circuits with realistic noise models, using advanced optimization techniques.

To run your remote emulator, you simply need to switch your Qiskit backend to a Scaleway-hosted emulator.

### 1. Prerequisites

* A Scaleway account with a valid **Project ID**.
* A Scaleway **API Key** (Secret Key).
* Python installed with `qiskit` and `qiskit-scaleway`.

```bash
pip install qiskit-scaleway
```

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit_scaleway import ScalewayProvider

# 1. Initialize the Provider
# Ensure you have your credentials ready
provider = ScalewayProvider(
    project_id="your-project-id",
    secret_key="your-secret-key"
)

# 2. Select the Aer GPU Platform
# Example platform ID: 'EMU-AER-2L40S' (Aer emulator using an Nvidia H100 GPU)
backend = provider.get_backend("EMU-AER-2L40S")

# 3. Create a Quantum Circuit
# Let's create a Bell state with measurement
qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
qc.h(0)
qc.cx(0, 1)
qc.measure_all()

# 4. No transpilation
# Scaleway QaaS handles the transpilation server-side for you

# 5. Execute on remote emulator
# The job is sent to Scaleway, executed on the GPU, and results are returned compressed.
job = backend.run(qc, shots=10000)

# 6. Get Results
result = job.result()

print("Results:", result)
```
