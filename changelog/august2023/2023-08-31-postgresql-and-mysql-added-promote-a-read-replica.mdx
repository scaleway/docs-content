You can now promote a Read Replica node to a standalone Database Instance. This is useful for database failure recovery or sharding.

For more information, refer to the [How to manage Read Replica](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/manage-read-replica/#how-to-promote-a-read-replica) documentation page.
