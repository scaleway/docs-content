A significant upgrade for all our clients is available now: the ability to seamlessly migrate your Web Hosting from Online to Scaleway Elements. Say hello to enhanced performance and features.

**How it works:**

The migration process starts off right from your familiar [Online Console](https://console.online.net/). Simply initiate the process when prompted, and you'll be guided through each step. If you have not already created a Scaleway account, you will receive an invitation to do so seamlessly.

Our migration tool handles everything for you, ensuring a smooth transition. Plus, if you also have domains hosted with Scaleway/Online, the process becomes even more streamlined. All you need to do is select your new hosting offer, and let the tool take care of the rest.

Upgrade to Scaleway Elements today and experience the next level of Web Hosting!
