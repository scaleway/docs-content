This page shows you how to edit your domain's name servers from the [Scaleway console]().

<Macro id="requirements" />

  - A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - [Created](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) an API key with sufficient [IAM permissions](/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/) to perform the actions described on this page
  - Registered a domain with Scaleway Domains and DNS

## Problem

You cannot edit domain's name servers from the Scaleway console. The **Edit** button is greyed out and the tooltip `Domain is in a transient status` displays.

## Possible cause


- Like in the DNSSEC in **Enabling** status.
