## Overview

VPC is currently in public beta, but will shortly be moving into general availability (GA). The arrival of VPC brings changes to the Scaleway Network products portfolio, which are summarized in the table below. Read on to find out more about the detail of these changes.

| Product          | Pre-VPC                            | During VPC Public Beta    | With VPC General Availability |
|------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Private Networks | One offer only: zoned Private Networks (scoped to a single AZ) | Classic offer (zoned Private Networks) continued <br /><br /> Beta offer: possibility to create regional Private Networks in a VPC, with optional migration of existing zoned Private Networks via the API   |  Classic offer (zoned Private Networks) is discontinued. <br /><br />All existing zoned Private Networks are automatically migrated to become regional Private Networks inside a VPC. <br /><br />Private Networks now offer DHCP (see below for more details about DHCP migration). |
| VPC              | ---                                | VPC is introduced. One default VPC in each region is created automatically for all users. <br /><br /> Beta testers can create  regional Private Networks in their VPCs | All users have one default VPC per region automatically created for them. <br /><br /> Users can opt to create additional VPCs. <br /><br />All Private Networks now exist within a VPC.  |
| Public Gateways  | When attached to a Private Network, Public Gateways provide DHCP, NAT & SSH bastion for resources in the network.   |  No change | DHCP functionality leaves Public Gateways and is now built directly into Private Networks. <br /><br/> Public Gateways continue to offer NAT and SSH bastion. |

- [What is beta vs general availability (GA)?](https://www.scaleway.com/en/betas/)

## VPC GA: What does it mean for Private Networks?

As summarized in the [table](#overview) above, when VPC goes into general availability, it will become impossible to create new zoned Private Networks. All Private Networks created from this point will be regional, exist inside a VPC, and have integrated DHCP.

There will also be an impact on pre-existing Private Networks. There are two aspects to this impact:

- **Zoned > Regional**: All pre-existing zoned Private Networks will be automatically migrated by Scaleway at the time of GA, and become regional Private Networks inside a VPC.
- **DHCP activation**: Prior to VPC GA, DHCP was not itself present on any pre-existing Private Networks. It was instead a feature of the [Public Gateway](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#public-gateway) which could optionally be attached to a Private Network and (if DHCP was activated), automatically asign private IP addresses to attached resources. When VPC goes into GA, DHCP functionality will move from Public Gateways to Private Networks themselves. **Whether or not DHCP will be automatically acticated on your pre-existing Private Network depends on the specifities of your configuration**.

Read on for more information about these two aspects.

## Aspect 1: Zoned to regional

All newly created Private Networks will be regional in scope. All pre-existing zoned Private Networks will be automatically migrated by Scaleway, to become regional Private Networks inside a VPC.

- This migration will be seamless, and no downtime is expected.
- Private Networks in `PAR-1`, `PAR-2` or `PAR-3` will become scoped to the whole `PAR` region, Private Networks from `AMS-1` or `AMS-2` will become scoped to the whole `AMS` region, and Private Networks from `WAW-1` or `WAW-2` will become scoped to the whole `WAW` region.
- Once your pre-existing Private Network has been migrated (or if you create a new Private Network), you will be able to attach resources from any of the AZs within the network's region. This gives you a Private Network where, for example, an Elastic Metal server in `PAR-2` can communicate with a Managed Database in `PAR-1`.
- One default VPC for each Scaleway region has already been created per [Project](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#project), and your newly migrated Private Networks will be accessible from within the default VPC for their region.

VPC with regional-scoped Private Networks is currently available to any customer for beta testing via the Scaleway console. Go and [check it out](https://console.scaleway.com/vpc/vpc) if you haven't already, to start getting familiar with the new setup before everything is migrated.

## Aspect 2: DHCP on Private Networks

From the time of GA, **whenever you create a new Private Network**, as well as being regional in its scope, it will also have **DHCP built into it**. This means:

- When creating a Private Network, you will have the choice to let us automatically generate IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR blocks (subnets) for you, or to define your own IPv4 CIDR block for the network.
- A managed DHCP server will be activated on the Private Network when created. This cannot be deactivated.
- When you attach a resource to the Private Network, it will automatically get a private IP address assigned to it from this subnet via DHCP. Resources will also be reachable just by using their name. Essentially, you can let Scaleway manage your IPs, with no hassle for you.
- These IP addresses are managed by our internal IPAM, which is the only source of truth and ensures full consistency.
- IP addresses are allocated and assigned to your resources: they are fixed and (for now) cannot be defined by the user, beyond definition of the CIDR block at the time of network creation. Watch this space for future developments in terms of Scaleway's IPAM and the functionality available to users.

<Message type="note">

**What if I still want to create a new Private Network and manage the attached resources' IPs by myself?** The Private Network's DHCP server will be activated by default, and cannot be deactivated. You can configure your resources' network interfaces yourself, but they won't be compatible with our managed products, as they're integrated with IPAM. We highly recommend letting us do all the "dirty work": you can simply relax and enjoy our fully-integrated ecosystem. Alternatively, you can wait for our currently-internal IPAM to offer more public features, such as IP reservation. However, at the time of writing, there is no ETA for this.

### DHCP activation on pre-existing Private Networks

Whether or not the managed DHCP server will be automatically activated on your pre-existing Private Networks depends on your configuration:

| Your configuration                                                | Impact                                                                  | 
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| I have a Private Network, with no Public Gateway attached to it   | DHCP will **not** be automatically activated on your Private Network, to avoid any conflicts with your existing IP addressing. <br /><br/>You will see a button in the Scaleway console inviting you to activate DHCP if/when you are ready. Note that activating DHCP is permanent, and there is no way to undo the activation, so proceed with caution. |
| I have a Private Network, attached to a Public Gateway, but DHCP is disabled on the gateway.   | DHCP will **not** be automatically activated on your Private Network, to avoid any conflicts with your existing IP addressing.  <br /><br/>You will see a button in the Scaleway console inviting you to activate DHCP if/when you are ready. Note that activating DHCP is permanent, and there is no way to undo the activation, so proceed with caution. |
| I have a Private Network, attached to a Public Gateway, and DHCP is enabled on the gateway.   | DHCP **will** be automatically activated on your Private Network, and cannot be deactivated. We will take care of IP management of your resources within your Private Network (see details above). <br /><br/>All the Public Gateway's leases will be synchronized with the managed DHCP, so there is no impact for you and no action is necessary. |
| I have a Private Network with my own DHCP server running on it | We assume that your network is therefore not attached to a Public Gateway with DHCP enabled (which would cause conflicts with your own DHCP server). DHCP will **not** be automatically activated on your Private Network, to avoid any conflicts with your existing IP addressing. <br /><br/>You will see a button in the Scaleway console inviting you to activate DHCP if/when you are ready. Note that activating DHCP is permanent, and there is no way to undo the activation, so proceed with caution. |

If you fall into one of the cases where DHCP is not automatically activated for you, as well as seeing an **Activate DHCP** button in the Scaleway console, you will also be able to activate via the API if you prefer.

## Impacts on the rest of the Scaleway ecosystem

When VPC goes into GA, you will see the following changes on our devtools and console:

**Scaleway console**
- The existing **Private Networks** section, available from the main menu (side bar) of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/), will soon cease to be accessible. Instead, you should select **VPC** in the side bar, and then click on the relevant VPC, to access and manage your Private Networks.
- The DHCP dashboard for **Public Gateways** will no longer be available, as this functionality moves to Private Networks.

**API**
- The VPC v1 zoned API (which actually only concerns Private Networks and not VPC as it is now understood) will keep working, but will be deprecated and moved to read only. The VPC v2 API, covering both VPCs and Private Networks with regional scope and DHCP, will be the new default API. Note that on the [VPC API documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/vpc/v2/), you can select v1 or v2 from the drop down menu at the top to navigate between the two versions.
- [DHCP reservations via the Public Gateway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/public-gateway/) will be deprecated but still available, to avoid breaking changes. In the future (no ETA), reservations should be available on Private Networks through IPAM.

**CLI**
- As the CLI does not support multiple versions of an API, new and future versions will drop the VPC v1 API in favor of v2.
- DHCP reservations via the Public Gateway will be deprecated but still available, to avoid breaking changes. In the future (no ETA), reservations should be available on Private Networks through IPAM.

**Terraform**
- Currently, a property exists on Private Network resources, to specify whether they are regional or not and allow use of the correct underlying API (VPC v1 or v2). This property will be deprecated once VPC is in GA.
- DHCP reservations via the Public Gateway will be deprecated but still available, to avoid breaking changes. In the future (no ETA), reservations should be available on Private Networks through IPAM.

## Why are we making these changes?

Security and networking are not easy. Mistakes can be made and details can be forgotten which can lead to conflicts in your configuration or serious security holes in your infrastructure. 

We are aiming to make it as easy as possible for our customers to create a secure infrastructure, with resources reachable in a simple yet safe way, able to communicate with each other without having to be exposed on the public Internet.

Each Scaleway Project will get a default VPC for each region. From there, it will only take a couple of clicks to create a Private Network with built-in DHCP in a VPC. No network configuration will be required, all the defaults are set up and ready to go. We even take care of making sure that each Private Network gets a large enough subnet that it will not overlap with that of any other Private Networks inside the same VPC.

As you attach your resources to the Private Network, they automatically get a fixed private IP address inside that subnet. They are also reachable just by using their name as we provide "Private DNS" resolution inside a Private Network.

We believe that plug and play is the way, and are aiming to provide you with everything you need to get your infrastructure up and running, as securely as possible, with minimal hassle.
