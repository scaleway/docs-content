## Availability Zone 

An Availability Zone refers to the geographical location in which your instance will be created. The latency between multiple AZs of the same region is low, as they have a common network layer. Find below the list of availability zones by region:

- France - Paris (`fr-par`)
  `fr-par-1`
  `fr-par-2`
  `fr-par-3`
- The Netherlands - Amsterdam (`nl-ams`)
  `nl-ams-1`
- Poland - Warsaw (`pl-waw`)
  `pl-waw-1`

## Backup

The backup feature allows you to create an [image](#image) of your Instance, which contains all its volumes. You can use this image not only to restore your Instance and its data but also to create a series of Instances with a predefined configuration. See our dedicated how-to on [how to create a backup of your Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-a-backup).

</Concept>

## Block Volumes

Block Storage provides network attached storage that can be plugged-in/out of cloud Instances like a virtual hard-drive. From a user’s point-of-view, the block device behaves like a regular disk.

</Concept>


<Concept>

## Boot-on-block

The boot-on-block feature allows Instances to boot from attached [Block storage](#block-volumes) volumes instead of local volumes. This feature is currently only available for [Enterprise Instances](#enterprise-instance). You can use this feature when you [create an Enterprise Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/use-enterprise-instances/#how-to-create-an-enterprise-instance)

</Concept>


<Concept>

Cloud-init is a multi-distribution package that [provides boot time customization for cloud servers](/compute/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes/#how-to-use-cloud-init). It enables automatic configuration of cloud Instances as it boots into the cloud, turning a generic Ubuntu image into a configured server in a few seconds.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Development Instance

[Development Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/development/) (aka DEV1 Instances) are reliable and flexible Instances tuned to host your websites, applications, and development environments.

</Concept>


<Concept>

## Enterprise Instance

[Scaleway Enterprise Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/enterprise/) (aka ENT1 Instances) are our latest high-end Instances based on the AMD EPYC™ 7003 Series Processor. These Instances support the boot-on-block feature which allows them to boot from attached Block Storage volumes. Enterprise Instances come without local storage and you can add one or several Block Storage volumes depending on your requirements. Check out our documentation: [how to use Enterprise Instances](/compute/instances/how-to/use-enterprise-instances/).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Flexible IP

Flexible IP addresses are public IP addresses that you can hold independently of any Instance. When you create a Scaleway Instance, its public IP address is also a flexible IP address. Flexible IP addresses can be attached to and detached from any of your Instances as you wish. You can keep a number of flexible IP addresses in your account at any given time. When you delete a flexible IP address, it is disassociated from your account to be used by other users. Find out more: [how to use flexible IP addresses](/compute/instances/how-to/use-flexips/)

</Concept>

<Concept>

## General Purpose Instance

[General Purpose Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/general-purpose/) (aka GP Instances)  are production-grade [Instances](#instance) designed for scalable infrastructure. This Instance type allows you to launch demanding services with local NVMe SSDs and high-end CPUs.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## GPU Instance

[GPU Instances](#https://www.scaleway.com/en/gpu-instances/) (aka RENDER Instances) are powerful cloud Instances equipped with dedicated high-end Nvidia graphics processing units. They have been designed for artificial intelligence and rendering tasks. They support your most demanding workloads.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Image

An image is a template for creating new Instances. It can be created from a [backup](#backup), which is a complete copy of an Instance containing all of its volumes, or a [snapshot](#snapshot), which is a copy of one specific volume.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Instance

An Instance is a computing unit, either virtual or physical, that provides resources to run your applications on. Currently Scaleway offers the following Instance types: [General Purpose](#general-purpose-instance), [Development](#development-instance), [GPU](#gpu-instance), [Stardust](#stardust-instance) and [Enterprise](#enterprise-instance).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Local Volumes

The local volume of an instance is an all-SSD-based storage solution, using a RAID array for redundancy and performance, hosted on the local hypervisor. On Scaleway Virtual Cloud Instances the size of the Local Volume is fixed and depends on the offer. It is always possible to increase the storage of a Virtual Cloud Instance by adding additional block volumes to an instance.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Placement groups

Placement groups allow you to run multiple Compute Instances each on a different physical hypervisor. placement groups have two operating modes. The first one is called `max_availability`. It ensures that all the Compute Instances that belong to the same cluster will not run on the same underlying hardware. The second one is called `low_latency` and does the exact opposite: it brings Compute Instances closer together to achieve higher network throughput. Find out more with our documentation on [how to use placement groups](/compute/instances/how-to/use-placement-groups/)

</Concept>

<Concept> 

## Power-off Mode

The Power-off mode [shuts down an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/power-off-instance/) by transferring all data on the local volume of the Instance to a volume store. The physical node is released back to the pool of available machines. The reserved flexible IP of the Instance remains available in the account.

**Note:**  Depending on the amount of data to be archived, this process can take some time.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Private networks

Private Networks allow your virtual Instances to communicate in an isolated and secure network without the need of being connected to the public Internet. [Each Instance can be connected to one or several Private Networks](/compute/instances/how-to/use-private-networks/), letting you build your own network topologies.

Private Networks are a LAN-like layer 2 ethernet network. A new network interface with a unique media access control address (MAC address) is configured on each instance in a Private Network. Use this interface to communicate in a secure and isolated network, using private IP addresses of your choice.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Protected Instance

The Protected Instance feature is used to prevent any halt action from being performed on your Instance. This only applies to running Instances. [Enabling the Protected Instance feature](/compute/instances/how-to/use-protected-instance/) means that you will not be able to delete, power off or reboot your Instance, nor put it into standby mode.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Public IP

Public IP addresses are routed on the Internet. You can enter the public IP address of your instance into any browser connected to the Internet, and access content being served from that Instance. You can think of public IP addresses like postal addresses for buildings - they are unique and tell the routers directing traffic through the Internet where to find a particular server.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Region

A Region is represented as a Geographical area such as France (Paris: `fr-par`) or the Netherlands (Amsterdam: `nl-ams`). It can contain multiple Availability Zones.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Rescue Mode

Rescue mode restarts your server via the network on a minimal operating system. You can [use rescue mode](/compute/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes/#how-to-use-rescue-mode) to debug your server and recover your system data. Rescue mode creates a ramdisk with the content of a downloaded rootfs. You will have access to all your disks and will be able to perform debug and rescue actions. After disabling rescue mode, you will have to reboot your server. Your server needs to be running to switch to rescue mode.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Reverse DNS

Reverse DNS is the opposite of classic "forward" DNS, and maps an IP address to a hostname. This can be useful if, for example, you want to send emails from your Instance. Find out how to [configure reverse DNS on your Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/configure-reverse-dns/) with our how-to documentation.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Security Group

Security groups allow you to [create rules to drop or allow traffic coming to and from your Instances](/compute/instances/how-to/use-security-groups/). You can set default policies for inbound and outbound traffic, and/or define rules to deal with traffic differently depending on its source. If you wish, you can then create your own private infrastructure by disabling the public IPs of your Instances. Security groups can be [stateful](#stateful-security-groups) to concept or [stateless](#stateless-security-groups). Note that security groups for Bare Metal servers cannot be stateful.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Snapshot

A snapshot takes a picture of a specific volume at one point in time. For example you may have a server with one volume containing the OS and another containing the application data, and want to use different snapshot strategies on both volumes. [Creating snapshots of your volumes](/compute/instances/how-to/create-a-snapshot/) gives you total freedom of which volumes you want to back up, while [images](#image) are more convenient for full backups of your Instance.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Stand-by Mode

Stand-by mode is designed to temporarily stop an Instance. When you [put a Virtual Instance into Stand-by mode](/compute/instances/how-to/use-standby-mode/), the server is halted, but the Compute Instance remains allocated to your account and all data remains on the local storage of the Instance.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Stardust Instance

[Stardust Instances](#https://www.scaleway.com/en/stardust-instances/) are the perfect Instances for small workloads and simple applications. You can create up to one instance per Availability Zone (available in FR-PAR-1 and NL-AMS-1).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Stateful Security Groups

Stateful Security Groups disregard the default policy and inbound/outbound rules if a connection is initiated from your Instance. Traffic will always be permitted on connections that you initiated. This is useful for example if you want to initiate connections on many different and various ports for messaging, video streaming, or other purposes. In this case, the traffic from/to that connection will not be blocked, even if you have defined a rule that would otherwise do so. Find out more with our dedicated documentation: [how to use Security Groups](/compute/instances/how-to/use-security-groups/)
 
</Concept>

<Concept>

## Stateless Security Groups

Stateless Security Groups strictly apply the default policy and inbound/outbound rules, regardless of whether a connection is initiated from your instance or not. This is useful if you know exactly which ports you will always require for your instance, eg. port `22` for SSH. You can make your security group stateless, define a rule to allow traffic on port `22`, and block incoming traffic on other ports regardless of whether a connection is initiated from your Instance on this port or not. Find out more with our dedicated documentation: [how to use Security Groups](/compute/instances/how-to/use-security-groups/)

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Tags

Tags allow you to organize your resources. This gives you the possibility of sorting and filtering your cloud assets in any organizational pattern of your choice, which in turn helps you arrange, control and monitor your cloud resources. You can assign as many tag as you want to each Scaleway product.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Volumes

Volumes are the storage space of your Instances. Each Virtual Cloud Instance requires a defined amount of local storage. Scaleway Instances benefit from local NVMe SSD volumes.

</Concept>
