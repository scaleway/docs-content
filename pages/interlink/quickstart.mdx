InterLink is currently in [Private Beta](https://www.scaleway.com/en/betas/), and only available to selected testers.
</Message>

InterLink is Scaleway's product to let you create a secure, private connection between your external infrastructure, and your Scaleway VPC. This allows you to direct your traffic safely from your Scaleway infrastructure to your on-premises infrastructure, away from the public internet.

- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to order an InterLink

<Lightbox src="scaleway-interlink-ordering.webp" alt="A four step flow chart shows the following steps: 1. User orders InterLink via Scaleway, 2. User requests InterLink from partner, 3. Partner accepts InterLink request, 4. Partner provisions InterLink." />

1. Click **InterLink** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. If you have not already created an InterLink, the product ordering page is displayed.

2. Click **Order InterLink**. The order wizard displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-order-interlink.webp" alt="A screen of the Scaleway console shows the InterLink order form. The different sections are explained in the steps below." />

3. Select a [connection type](/interlink/concepts/#connection-type), the type of physical InterLink connection. For now, only **hosted** connections are available.

4. Select a [partner](/interlink/concepts/#partner) to facilitate the physical connection between the external infrastructure and the Scaleway VPC. Generally you must be client of the chosen partner, e.g. with your infrastructure in their datacenter, or on your own premises using the partner as a network provider. [Get help with choosing a partner](/interlink/reference-content/overview/#hosted-interlinks).

5. Choose a [region](/interlink/concepts/#partner) for your InterLink. This must correspond to the Scaleway VPC you want to attach later.

6. Choose a [location](/interlink/concepts/#partner) for your InterLink. This represents the physical location where the connection to Scaleway's network will be established.

7. Choose a [bandwidth](/interlink/concepts/#bandwidth) amount. This represents the maximum bandwidth that will be available over the InterLink.

8. Enter a name and optional tags for your InterLink.

9. Check the estimated cost for your InterLink. Note that Scaleway will start billing you for the InterLInk as soon as you order it. You must then wait for your partner to provision the connection, who may charge you additional fees.

10. Click **Order InterLink**.

Your InterLink is ordered, and its status briefly shows as `Configuring`, then `Requested`. **You must now contact your chosen partner to request they provision your InterLink from their end.**

## How to complete InterLink provisioning.

1. Click **InterLink** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. A listing of your InterLinks displays.

2. Click on the InterLink that you want to finish provisioning. The InterLink's **Overview** page displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-interlink-overview-requesting.webp" alt="A screen in the Scaleway console show's an overview of an InterLink's partner, location, region, bandwidth, creation date, pairing key, and IPv4/IPv6 connectivity status." />

3. Note down the [pairing key](/interlink/concepts/#pairing-key) for your InterLink. This is a unique identification number which the partner will need in order to provision your InterLink.

4. Contact your partner. After [creating your InterLink order](/interlink/how-to/order-interlink/), either their online portal URL, or their email address was displayed to you for this purpose. Use the relevant method to contact your partner, provide the pairing key, and request that they provision your InterLink from their side.

<Message type="tip">
You can also use the [Get a partner](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/interlink/#path-partners-get-a-partner) endpoint in the API to get contact details and other information about your selected partner. 
</Message>

Your InterLink will remain in `Requested` status until the partner responds to your request. You can keep track of your InterLink's [status](/interlink/reference-content/statuses/) via the [InterLink listing](https://console.scaleway.com/interlink/links) in the Scaleway console.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-interlink-listing.webp" alt="A screen in the Scaleway console shows a listing of InterLinks, with the following information: name, status, partner, location, region and bandwidth." />

When the partner approves your request, the InterLink moves to `Provisioning` status. This means that the partner has agreed to facilitate your InterLink, and is now preparing the resources and configuration necessary to establish the physical connection. 

When the partner has finished provisioning your InterLink, it moves to `Active` status. This indicates that the physical link and necessary accompanying configuration has been completed on the partner's side, and your InterLink is ready for use.

<Message type="tip">
If you experience any unexpected statuses, refer to our [information page on InterLink statuses](/interlink/reference-content/statuses/) for full explanation and guidance.

## How to configure your InterLink

After your InterLink has been provisioned, a number of configuration steps are necessary to enable traffic to flow over the InterLink.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-interlink-config.webp" alt="A four step flow chart shows the following steps: 1. Create InterLink, 2. Attach VPC, 3. Attach allowed routes list, 4. Activate route propagation. After these steps are complete, traffic can flow across the InterLink" />

### How to attach a VPC

Attaching an InterLink to a VPC allows you to complete the connection from your external infrastructure, across the InterLink, to the Scaleway resources in the selected VPC.

1. Click **InterLink** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. A listing of your InterLinks displays.

2. Click on the InterLink that you want to configure. The InterLink's **Overview** page displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-interlink-overview-up.webp" alt="A screen in the Scaleway console show's an overview of an InterLink's partner, location, region, bandwidth, creation date, pairing key, and IPv4/IPv6 connectivity status. Underneath are the 'Attached VPC', 'Route propagation' and 'Tags' panels." />

3. In the **Attached VPC** section, click **Attach VPC**. A pop-up displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-interlink-attach-vpc.webp" alt="A screen in the Scaleway console invites the user to attach a VPC to complete the connection from their external infrastructure, across the InterLink to their Scaleway resources. A dropdown menu allows a VPC to be selected. A banner reminds users to check any attached route filter lists for compatibility with the selected VPC." />
 
4. Select one of your existing VPCs from the dropdown list. It must be in the same region as the InterLink. Alternatively, click **+ Create VPC** to create and attach a new VPC.

    <Message type="tip">
    An InterLink can only be attached to one VPC at a time, but you are free to detach the VPC and attach a different one whenever you like.
    </Message>

5. Click **Attach VPC**

    The VPC is attached and you are returned to the InterLink's **Overview** page.

### How to attach an allowed routes list

After attaching a VPC, the next step in configuring your InterLink is to create and attach an allowed routes list. 

The VPC and the external infrastructure's routers both announce their routes to each other via [BGP](/interlink/concepts/#border-gateway-protocol-bgp) when route propagation is activated, but all of these routes are blocked by default. Allowed routes lists let you whitelist ranges of route announcements to allow, so that traffic can flow along these routes across the InterLink.

Each InterLink can have one allowed routes list attached to it, but a single allowed routes list can be attached to multiple InterLinks, if desired.

See the dedicated documentation on [creating an allowed routes list](/interlink/how-to/create-allowed-routes-list/) to create a list, then follow these instructions to attach it:

1. Click **InterLink** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. A listing of your InterLinks displays.

2. Click on the InterLink that you want to configure. The InterLink's **Overview** page displays.

3. In the **Route propagation** section, click **Attach allowed routes list**. A pop-up displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-attach-allowed-routes.webp" alt="A pop-up in the Scaleway console prompts a user to select an allowed routes list from a drown down list." />

4. Select an allowed routes list from the drop-down list, and click **Attach list**.

        <Message type="tip">
        Make sure that the allowed routes list is suitable for the incoming routes (announced by the Scaleway VPC) and outgoing routes (announced by the external infrastructure) that should be propagated on this InterLink.
        </Message>

The list is attached, ad you are returned to the InterLink's **Overview** page.

### How to activate route propagation

Once you have attached a VPC and attached an allowed routes list, you can activate route propagation. This is the final step in configuring your InterLink so that traffic can flow between the VPC and your external infrastructure: it triggers the dynamic exchange of route information between the VPC and external infrastructure.

1. Click **InterLink** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. A listing of your InterLinks displays.

2. Click on the InterLink that you want to configure. The InterLink's **Overview** page displays.

3. In the **Route propagation** section, use the toggle <Icon name="toggle" /> to turn route propagation **ON**.  

    A pop-up displays, showing the attached allowed routes list which will define the incoming and outgoing route announcements to accept. You can change the attached allowed routes list if you wish. 
    
    It is not possible to activate route propagation without attaching an allowed routes list, as all route announcements would be blocked, rendering the action ineffective.

4. Click **Activate route propagation**.

    Route propagation is activated, and you are returned to your InterLink's overview page. 
    
    While route propagation remains active, traffic can flow across the routes allowed over the InterLink. The VPC and external infrastructure will dynamically exchange and update route information. You can deactivate route propagation at any time: if you do so, all routes are blocked and no traffic can flow.

## How to delete an InterLink

You can delete your InterLink at any time. Action is required on both the Scaleway side and the partner side to completely deprovision the InterLink. Follow the steps below.

1. Click **InterLink** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. A listing of your InterLinks displays.

2. Click on the InterLink that you want to delete. The InterLink's **Overview** page displays.

3. [Deactivate route propagation](/interlink/how-to/configure-interlink/#how-to-deactivate-route-propagation).

4. In the **Delete InterLink** panel, click **Delete InterLink**. 

        A pop-up displays, confirming that this action will permanently delete your InterLink on the Scaleway side.

5. Type **DELETE** in the box, and click **Delete InterLink**.

        You are returned to the InterLink's **Overview** page, where it's status now shows as **Deprovisioning**. Scaleway stops billing you for your InterLink at this point, and it can no longer be configured, un-deleted, or used to route traffic.

6. Contact your partner to request that they delete the InterLink resource on their side. They may continue to bill you until you do so, and they deprovision the resource on their side. To get in touch with the partner, you can use the same contact information that you used when [requesting the InterLink from the partner](/interlink/how-to/complete-provisioning/).

<Message type="note">
If the provisioning of your InterLink by the partner was never completed, e.g. you a) never contacted the partner to request provisioning of the InterLink, or b) the partner refused to provision your InterLink, you do not need to contact the partner again to request that they deprovision the resource. Deleting it on the Scaleway side is sufficient. 
</Message>

When the InterLink is fully deprovisioned on both sides, it will be deleted from the list of your InterLinks, and its Overview page will no longer be accessible.
