## Problem

I am experiencing issues while deleting objects

## Cause

- The object you are trying to delete is locked
- The bucket is versioned, and deleting an object adds a **delete marker** rather than deleting the object 

## Possible solutions

### Object lock

Check if the object is locked using the [HeadObject](/object-storage/api-cli/object-operations/#headobject) command. If it is locked with the **Governance** retention mode, you can bypass it with the [DeleteObject](/object-storage/api-cli/object-operations/#deleteobject) command using the `x-amz-bypass-governance-retention` header. You must also specify the VersionId of the object, as buckets with object lock enabled are automatically versioned.

### Bucket versioning

A [DeleteObject](/object-storage/api-cli/object-operations/#deleteobject) operation on a versioned bucket with no `VersionId` specified will create a delete marker, and the targeted objects will keep existing. To permanently delete it, list all the versions with [ListObjectVersions](/object-storage/api-cli/bucket-operations/#listobjectversions) (you can specify the name of your object as a prefix), then use the [DeleteObject](/object-storage/api-cli/object-operations/#deleteobject) operation on each version. 

## Going further

- Refer to the [object lock documentation](/object-storage/api-cli/object-lock/) for more information.

- Refer to the [bucket versioning documentation](/object-storage/how-to/use-bucket-versioning/) for more information.

- If you did not manage to identify the error and solve it by yourself, [open a support ticket](/account/how-to/open-a-support-ticket/), and provide as many details as possible, along with the necessary information below:
    - Object Storage Endpoint (e.g. `s3.fr-par.scw.cloud`)
    - Bucket name
    - Object name (if the request concerns an object)
    - Request type (PUT, GET, etc.)
    - HTTP status code
    - Date and time (timestamp)
    - User-agent (SDK, client, console, etc.)
    - Transaction ID (if possible)
    - Log / trace of the error (if possible)
