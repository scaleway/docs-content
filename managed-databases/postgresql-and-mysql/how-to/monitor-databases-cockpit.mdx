You can view your Managed Database for PostgreSQL or MySQL metrics and logs using [Scaleway Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/quickstart/). Managed Databases are fully integrated into Cockpit.

This page explains how to get started with Scaleway Cockpit for viewing your Managed Database metrics and logs.

<Macro id="cockpit-update-dashboards" />

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [PostgreSQL or MySQL Database Instance](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/quickstart)

## How to activate your Cockpit

Scaleway Cockpit is activated by default if you have created any [Scaleway resources integrated with Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-limitations/#product-integration-into-cockpit).

## How to access the Grafana dashboard

To view your Managed Database's metrics and logs, use the Grafana dashboard which is accessible from the Scaleway console:
  - First, you must create a user and their associated credentials (a username and password) for Grafana
  - Then, you can use these credentials to access the Grafana dashboard for all your Scaleway products, via the Scaleway console.

1. Create a Grafana user and retrieve their username and password by [following this procedure](/observability/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/).

2. From the Scaleway console [Cockpit overview page](https://console.scaleway.com/cockpit/overview), click **Open dashboards** in the top right corner.

3. Enter your Grafana username and password to log in.

    You are directed to the Scaleway Cockpit dashboards homepage.

## How to view and understand your Managed Database metrics

From the Scaleway Cockpit dashboards homepage, click **Dashboards** in the side menu, and select **LB Overview**.

    You are directed to the Load Balancer Overview dashboard.

- **C: Load Balancer name**: Click this drop-down to select which of your Load Balancers you want to display metrics for.
