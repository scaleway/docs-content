Structured outputs allow users to get consistent, machine-readable JSON format responses from language models.
JSON, as a widely-used format, enables seamless integration with a variety of platforms and applications. Its interoperability is crucial for developers aiming to incorporate AI functionality into their current systems with minimal adjustments.

By specifying a response format when using the [Chat Completions API](/ai-data/generative-apis/api-cli/using-chat-api/), you can ensure that responses are returned in a JSON structure.
There are two main modes for generating JSON: **Object Mode** (schemaless) and **Schema Mode** (deterministic, structured output).

You can interact with text models in several ways:
- Via the Scaleway [console](https://console.scaleway.com), which will soon provide a complete [playground](/ai-data/generative-apis/how-to/query-text-models/#accessing-the-playground), aiming to test models, adapt parameters, and observe how these changes affect the output in real-time.
- Via the [Chat API](/ai-data/generative-apis/how-to/query-text-models/#querying-text-models-via-api)

- Access to Generative APIs.
    While in beta, the service is restricted to invited users. You can request access by filling out a form on Scaleway's [Betas page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/betas/#generative-apis).
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) for API authentication
- Python 3.7+ installed on your system

## Types of structured outputs

- **JSON mode** (schemaless):
   - Type: `{"type": "json_object"}`
   - This mode is non-deterministic and allows the model to output a JSON object without strict validation.
   - Useful for flexible outputs when you expect the model to infer a reasonable structure based on your prompt.
   - JSON mode is older and has been used by developers since early API implementations.

- **Structured outputs (schema mode)** (deterministic/structured):
   - Type `{"type": "json_schema"}`
   - This mode enforces a strict schema format, where the output adheres to the predefined structure.
   - Supports complex types and validation mechanisms as per the [JSON schema specification](https://json-schema.org/specification/).
   - Structured outputs is a newer feature implemented by OpenAI in 2024 to enable stricter, schema-based response formatting.

<Message type="note">
    - All LLMs on the Scaleway library support **JSON mode** and **Structured outputs**, however, the quality of results will vary in the schemaless JSON mode.
    - JSON mode: It is important to explicitly ask the model to generate a JSON output either in system prompt or user prompt. To prevent infinite generations, model providers most often encourage users to ask the model for short JSON objects.
    - Structured outputs: Scaleway supports the [JSON schema specification](https://json-schema.org/specification/) including nested schemas composition (`anyOf`, `allOf`, `oneOf` etc), `$ref`, `all` types, and regular expressions.

## Code examples

<Message type="tip">
    Before diving into the code examples, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
    ```bash
    pip install openai pydantic
    ```
</Message>

The following Python examples demonstrate how to use both **JSON mode** and **Structured outputs** to generate structured responses.

We will send to our LLM a voice note transcript in order to structure it.
Below is our base code:

```python
import json
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

# Set your preferred model
MODEL = "llama-3.1-8b-instruct"

# Set your API key
API_KEY = "<SCW_API_KEY>"

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.scaleway.ai/v1",
    api_key=API_KEY,
)

# Define the schema for the output using Pydantic
class VoiceNote(BaseModel):
    title: str = Field(description="A title for the voice note")
    summary: str = Field(description="A short one sentence summary of the voice note.")
    actionItems: list[str] = Field(description="A list of action items from the voice note")

# Transcript to use for the output
TRANSCRIPT = ( 
    "Good evening! It's 6:30 PM, and I'm just getting home from work. I have a few things to do " 
    "before I can relax. First, I'll need to water the plants in the garden since they've been in the sun all day. " 
    "Then, I'll start preparing dinner. I think a simple pasta dish with some garlic bread should be good. " 
    "While that's cooking, I'll catch up on a couple of phone calls I missed earlier."
)
```

### Using JSON mode (schemaless)

In JSON mode, you can prompt the model to output a JSON object without enforcing a strict schema.

```python
extract = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "The following is a voice message transcript. Only answer in JSON.",
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": TRANSCRIPT,
        },
    ],
    model=MODEL,
    response_format={
        "type": "json_object",
    },
)
output = json.loads(extract.choices[0].message.content)
print(json.dumps(output, indent=2))
```

Output example:
```json
{
  "current_time": "6:30 PM",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "task": "water the plants in the garden",
      "priority": "high"
    },
    {
      "task": "prepare dinner (pasta with garlic bread)",
      "priority": "high"
    },
    {
      "task": "catch up on phone calls",
      "priority": "medium"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Using structured outputs with JSON schema (Pydantic)

Using [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/models/), users can define the schema as a Python class and enforce the model to return results adhering to this schema.

```python
extract = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "The following is a voice message transcript. Only answer in JSON.",
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": TRANSCRIPT,
        },
    ],
    model=MODEL,
    response_format={
        "type": "json_schema",
        "json_schema": {
            "schema": VoiceNote.model_json_schema(),
        }
    },
)
output = json.loads(extract.choices[0].message.content)
print(json.dumps(output, indent=2))
```

Output example:
```json
{
  "title": "To-Do List",
  "summary": "Returning from work, need to complete tasks before relaxing",
  "actionItems": [
    "Water garden",
    "Prepare dinner: pasta dish with garlic bread",
    "Catch up on missed phone calls"
  ]
}
```

### Using structured outputs with JSON schema (manual definition)

Alternatively, users can manually define the JSON schema inline when calling the model.

```python
extract = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "The following is a voice message transcript. Only answer in JSON.",
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": TRANSCRIPT,
        },
    ],
    model=MODEL,
    response_format={
        "type": "json_schema",
        "json_schema": {
            "schema": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "title": {"type": "string"},
                    "summary": {"type": "string"},
                    "actionItems": {
                        "type": "array",
                        "items": {"type": "string"}
                    }
                },
                "required": ["title", "summary", "actionItems"]
            }
        }
    }
)
output = json.loads(extract.choices[0].message.content)
print(json.dumps(output, indent=2))
```

Output example:
```json
{
  "title": "Evening Routine",
  "actionItems": [
    "Water the plants",
    "Cook dinner (pasta and garlic bread)",
    "Make phone calls"
  ],
  "summary": "Made a list of tasks to accomplish before relaxing tonight"
}
```

## Conclusion

Using structured outputs with LLMs can significantly enhance data handling in your applications.
By choosing between JSON mode and Structured outputs with JSON schema, you control the consistency and structure of the model's responses to suit your specific needs.

- **JSON mode** is flexible but less predictable.
- **Structured outputs** provide strict adherence to a predefined schema, ensuring consistency.

Experiment with both methods to determine which best fits your application's requirements.
