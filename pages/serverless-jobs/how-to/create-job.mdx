This page shows you how to create Serverless Jobs using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/).

You can create a job from the [Scaleway Container Registry](/container-registry/quickstart/), or any other public container registry, such as Docker Hub, AWS Container registries, GitLab container registry, etc.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a Container Registry namespace](/container-registry/how-to/create-namespace/) and [pushed a container image](/container-registry/how-to/push-images/) to it

## Create a job from the Scaleway Container Registry

Scaleway's Serverless Jobs allows you to create jobs from several container [registries](/container-registry/concepts/#registry), including the [Scaleway Container Registry](/container-registry/concepts/#container-registry) which allows you to store, secure and manage all your custom container images effortlessly.

1. Click **Jobs** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The jobs page displays.

2. Click **Create job**. The job creation wizard displays.

### Job configuration

1. Select the **Scaleway** Container Registry.

2. Select the required Container Registry namespace from the drop-down list, and then select the container image and tag.

3. Enter a name or use the automatically generated one. The name can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes.

4. Select the region in which your job will be created.

### Job resources and scaling

1. Select the **resources** to allocate to your job at runtime. These define the performance characteristics of your job.

2. Add a **cron schedule** in the `* * * * *` format, and select your time zone to run your job periodically. Refer to the [cron schedules documentation](/serverless-jobs/reference-content/cron-schedules/) for more information.

### Job advanced options

    <TabsTab label="Data">
    1. Declare [environment variables](/serverless-jobs/concepts/#environment-variables) you want to inject into your job. For each environment variable, click **+Add variable** and enter the key/value pair.
    2. Add [secrets references](/serverless-functions/concepts/#secrets) for your Job. Secret references are environment variables fetched from [Scaleway Secret Manager](/secret-manager/) that are injected into your job, but the values are not retained or displayed by Scaleway after initial validation. 
          <Message type="note">
          Encode your environment variables and secrets to `base64` if they are too large, and contain carriage returns.

    </TabsTab>
    <TabsTab label="Storage">
    - Customize the ephemeral storage for your job according to your requirements. The data stored in your job is not retained once it is finished. 
    </TabsTab>
    <TabsTab label="Execution">
    1. Add a **startup command** to your job. It will be executed every time your job is run.
    2. Set a **maximum duration** to your job to stop it automatically if it does not complete within this limit.
    </TabsTab>
</Tabs>

### Job creation and execution

1. Verify the **estimated cost**.

2. Click **Create a job definition** to finish. You are directed to the listing of your Serverless Jobs.

3. Click the name of the job you just created. The **Overview** tab displays.

4. Click **Run job** to execute it.

The execution appears in the **Job runs** section of the **Overview** tab.

## Create a job from an external container registry

Scaleway Serverless Jobs allows you to create jobs from external public [container registries](/container-registry/concepts/#registry), such as Docker Hub, AWS container registries, GitLab container registry, etc.

Private external container registries are currently not supported.
