DNS (Domain Name System) is a service that translates the IP address of computers connected to the Internet into human-readable domain names & vice-versa. In an environment with a limited amount of Linux machines, it is possible to use the `/etc/hosts` file for associating an IP address to a DNS name, but when you have a large infrastructure with lots of systems/resources, `/etc/hosts` may quickly become cumbersome.

[BIND](https://www.isc.org/bind/) or Berkeley Internet Name Domain is open-source software that implements DNS protocols for the Internet. In this tutorial, we need a DNS server machine & a client machine for testing.

## Installing BIND

Install BIND and its related tools.
    ```
    apt-get install bind9 bind9utils bind9-doc dnsutils
    ```

## Configuring BIND on the primary instance

1. Edit the `name.conf.local` file:
    ```
    cd /etc/bind
    nano named.conf.locale
    ```
2. Paste the following. Make sure to edit the domain name and the IP address of the secondary machine.
    ```
    //
    // Do any local configuration here
    //

    // Consider adding the 1918 zones here, if they are not used in your
    // organization
    //include "/etc/bind/zones.rfc1918";

    zone "scw-domain.ml" IN {
                    type master;
                    file "/etc/bind/db.scw-domain.ml";
                    allow-update { 51.15.250.21; };
                    allow-transfer { 51.15.250.21; };
                    notify yes;
            };
    ```
3. Create your zone file. A zone file must contain at least an SOA, a NS and a A record or CNAME.
    ```
    nano db.scw-domain.ml
    ```
4. Paste the following:
    ```
    ;
    ; BIND data file for local loopback interface
    ;
    $TTL    10800
    scw-domain.ml.  IN      SOA     ns1.scw-domain.ml. admin.scw-domain.ml. (
                            2018120615      ; Serial
                              10800         ; Refresh
                              3600          ; Retry
                            2419200         ; Expire
                            604800 )       ; Negative Cache TTL
    ;

    ; Nameserver

    scw-domain.ml.  IN      NS      ns1.scw-domain.ml.
    scw-domain.ml.  IN      NS      ns2.scw-domain.ml.
    ns1     86400   IN      A       51.15.242.21
    ns1     86400   IN      AAAA    2001:bc8:4400:2c00::14:229
    ns2     86400   IN      A       51.15.250.21
    ns2     86400   IN      AAAA    2001:bc8:4400:2c00::2c:1f
    www     86400   IN      A       51.15.242.21
    www     86400   IN      AAAA    2001:bc8:4400:2c00::14:229
    ```

## Configuring Bind on the secondary instance

1. Edit the `name.conf.local` file:
    ```
    cd /etc/bind
    nano named.conf.local
    ```
2. Paste the following:
    ```
    //
    // Do any local configuration here
    //

    // Consider adding the 1918 zones here, if they are not used in your
    // organization
    //include "/etc/bind/zones.rfc1918";
    zone "scw-domain.ml" IN {
                    type slave;
                    file "/etc/bind/db.scw-domain.ml";
                    masters { 51.15.242.21; };
                    allow-transfer { none; };
                    allow-notify { 127.0.0.1; 51.15.242.21; 51.15.250.21; 2001:bc8:4400:2c00::14:229;  };
            };
    ```
3. On the primary machine, restart the service to verify that the zone replication works properly.
    ```
    service bind9 restart
    ```

The following output displays in the syslog file of the secondary machine:

```
tail /var/log/syslog

Jan 11 17:24:22 bind-client named[11492]: client @0x7fa0d00c7260 51.15.242.21#42782: received notify for zone 'scw-domain.ml'
Jan 11 17:24:22 bind-client named[11492]: zone scw-domain.ml/IN: notify from 51.15.242.21#42782: zone is up to date
Jan 11 17:24:22 bind-client named[11492]: client @0x7fa0d003b900 2001:bc8:4400:2c00::14:229#53121: received notify for zone 'scw-domain.ml'
Jan 11 17:24:22 bind-client named[11492]: zone scw-domain.ml/IN: notify from 2001:bc8:4400:2c00::14:229#53121: zone is up to date
```

You can try to resolve hostnames on both servers by typing `dig www.scw-domain.ml @ns1.scw-domain.ml` & `dig www.scw-domain.ml @ns2.scw-domain.ml`

You should see in the answer section the following:
```
;; ANSWER SECTION:
www.scw-domain.ml.	86400	IN	A	51.15.242.21
```
