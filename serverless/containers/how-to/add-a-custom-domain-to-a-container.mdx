Each container comes with an automatically generated domain on which it is available. However it is possible to use your own domain name to address your containers to facilitate their use.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - A running [Serverless Container](/serverless/containers/how-to/deploy-a-container-from-scaleway-container-registry/)
  - You have registered a domain name with the provider of your choice and have access to the domain name's DNS zone file
</Message>

1. On your domain provider's platform (for example [Scaleway's domains](/network/domains-and-dns/how-to/manage-dns-records/)), add a CNAME record pointing to your container default URL in the domains DNS zone file.

    <Message type="note">
      - All domains are supported.
      - CNAME flattening is supported. [CNAME flattening](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cname-flattening-rfc-compliant-cnames-at-a-domains-root/) speeds up CNAME resolution and allows you to use a CNAME record at your root/apex domain.
      - If your DNS provider does not support CNAME flattening, you need to create an ALIAS on your root domain (named `@` or with an empty name) instead of a CNAME.
    </Message>
2. Click the **Endpoints** tab on your containers' page.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-containers-domain.webp" alt="" />
3. Click on **+ Add a New Endpoint**.
4. Enter your custom domain name and validate the form.
5. The console runs checks on the CNAME and TLS configuration of the custom domain name. Connect to your container using your custom domain once all checks have completed.

<Message type="note">
  Be careful, for now **Custom Domains** does not support websockets. If you need to use websockets you must configure them with the original URL.
