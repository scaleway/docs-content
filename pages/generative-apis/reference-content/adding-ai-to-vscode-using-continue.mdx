AI-powered coding is transforming software development by automating repetitive tasks, generating code, improving code quality, and even detecting and fixing bugs. By integrating AI-driven tools, developers can significantly boost productivity and streamline their workflows. 
This guide provides a step-by-step guide on how to integrate AI-powered code models into VS Code using Continue and Scaleway's Generative APIs.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) for API authentication
- Installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on your local machine

## Install Continue in VS Code

You can install Continue directly from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue) or via the command line:

```bash
code --install-extension continue.continue
```

### Configure Continue to use Scaleway’s Generative APIs

To link Continue with Scaleway's Generative APIs, you need to configure a settings file:

- Create a `config.json` file inside your `.continue` directory.
- Add the following configuration to enable Scaleway's Generative API:
    ```json
    {
      "models": [
        {
          "model": "qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct",
          "title": "Qwen2.5 Coder",
          "provider": "scaleway",
          "apiKey": "###SCW_SECRET_KEY###"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
- Save the file at the correct location:
  - Linux/macOS: `~/.continue/config.json`
  - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.continue\config.json`

<Message type="tip">
  For more details on configuring `config.json`, refer to the [official Continue documentation](https://docs.continue.dev/reference).
</Message>

### Configuring tab completion

To enable AI-powered tab completion in Continue, add the following configuration to your `.continue/config.json`:

```json
{
  "tabAutocompleteModel": {
    "title": "Scaleway",
    "provider": "scaleway",
    "model": "qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct",
    "apiKey": "###SCW_SECRET_KEY###"
  }
}
```

<Message type="important">
  Enabling tab completion **may lead to higher token consumption** as the model generates predictions for every keystroke. Be mindful of your API usage and adjust settings accordingly to avoid unexpected costs. For more information refer to the [official Contine documentation](https://docs.continue.dev/reference#tabautocompleteoptions).
</Message>

### Activating Continue in VS Code

After configuring the API, open VS Code and activate Continue:

- Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
- Type `"Continue"` and select the appropriate command to enable AI-powered assistance.

## Using Continue for AI-powered coding

Once Continue is configured, you can leverage AI capabilities to streamline development. Below are some key features:

### AI-assisted code generation

Use the "Continue: Generate Code" command to generate boilerplate code, functions, or even entire classes based on natural language prompts.

#### Example

- Input prompt: *"Create a Python function to merge two sorted lists"*
- AI-Generated output:
  ```python
  def merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2):
      return sorted(list1 + list2)
  ```

### Intelligent code completion

Continue enhances your coding workflow with AI-driven code completion. Simply start typing, and the AI model will predict and complete your code.

### Automated code refactoring

Refactoring is essential for maintaining clean and efficient code. Use the *"Continue: Refactor Code"* command to improve readability and optimize performance.

#### Example

- Before refactoring:
  ```python
  def add_numbers(a, b):
      result = a + b
      return result
  ```

- After AI-driven refactoring:
  ```python
  def add_numbers(a, b):
      return a + b
  ```

## Conclusion

By integrating Continue with Scaleway’s Generative APIs, you unlock AI-powered coding capabilities that enhance productivity, automate repetitive tasks, and improve code quality.
