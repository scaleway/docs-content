Both the [Chat Completions API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/generative-apis/#path-chat-completions-create-a-chat-completion) and the [Responses API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/generative-apis/#path-responses-beta-create-a-response) are OpenAI-compatible REST APIs that can be used for generating and manipulating conversations. The Chat Completions API is focused on generating conversational responses, while the Responses API is a more general REST API for chat, structured outputs, tool use, and multimodal inputs.

The **Chat Completions** API was released in 2023, and is an industry standard for building AI applications, being specifically designed for handling multi-turn conversations. It is stateless, but allows users to manage conversation history by appending each new message to the ongoing conversation. Messages in the conversation can include text, images and audio extracts. The API supports `function` tool-calling, allowing developers to define functions that the model can choose to call. If it does so, it returns the function name and arguments, which the developer's code must execute and feed back into the conversation.

The **Responses** API was released in 2025, and is designed to combine the simplicity of Chat Completions with the ability to do more agentic tasks and reasoning. It supports statefulness, being able to maintain context without needing to resend the entire conversation history. It offers tool-calling by built-in tools (e.g. web or file search) that the model is able to execute itself while generating a response. 

<Message type="note">
Scaleway's support for the Responses API is currently at beta stage. Support of the full feature set will be incremental: currently statefulness and tools other than `function` calling are not supported. 
</Message>

Most supported Generative API models can be used with both Chat Completions and Responses API. For the **`gtp-oss-120b` model, use of the Responses API is recommended, as it will allow you to access all of its features, especially tool-calling.

For full details on the differences between these APIs, see the [official OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/migrate-to-responses).
