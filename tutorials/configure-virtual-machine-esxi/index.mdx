## VMware ESXi - Overview

[VMware ESXi](https://www.vmware.com/products/esxi-and-esx.html) is a hypervisor developed by VMware to deploy and manage virtual machines. Unlike other solutions, ESXi is not a software application running on a traditional operating system. Instead, it provides vital OS components, such as a kernel.

Management of the virtual machines can be done through an easy-to-use web interface.

## Installing ESXi

There are two ways to install EXSi on a Dedibox server: through the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net/en/login) or through [KVM over IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch#KVM_over_IP_(IPKVM)).

### Via the Dedibox console

1. Access the server page of your Dedibox on the console and click **Install**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-click-on-install.webp" width="800" alt="" />
2. Click **VIRTUALIZATION DISTRIBUTIONS**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-virtualizaton-distributions.webp" width="800" alt="" />
3. Select EXSi on the distribution menu, then **EXSi 7.0U1c 64BITS** under **Choose a Version** and click **Install EXSI**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-install-exsi.webp" width="800" alt="" />
4. Complete the next steps by including your **Partitioning** and **System Configuration** preferences when requested and conclude installation.

### Via KVM over IP

Your server can also be booted from an ESXi ISO file through a KVM over IP device if included in your Dedibox. This type of installation gives you the possibility of installing your own licenses or remote ISO files.

ESXi ISO images are available on VMware's ["Evaluate Products"](https://www.vmware.com/try-vmware.html) page.

1. To begin installation via KVM over IP, access the server page of your Dedibox on the console and click **Install**.
2. Click **KVM over IP**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kvm-over-ip.webp" width="800" alt="" />

    A **Disclaimer** window pops up. 
3. Make sure you have read and agreed to the terms displayed and click **I ACCEPT**.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-disclaimer.webp" width="600" alt="" />

    You are redirected to your server's status page.
4. Click the third button on the right. The model of the KVM over IP device is determined by the brand of your Dedibox chassis. For a Dell chassis, you will use **IDRAC**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-idrac.webp" width="800" alt="" />

The process from this step forward may differ according to the KVM model being used. Refer to the Dedibox [KVM over IP documentation](/dedibox/kvm-over-ip/quickstart/) to conclude the installation.

## Registering ESXi

1. Open your web browser and go to `https://your_dedibox_ip/` (replace `your_dedibox_ip` with the public IP address of your Dedibox).

    The ESXI login screen displays.
2. Log in with the user `root` and the password set during the installation of ESXi.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-vmware_login.webp" width="800" alt="" />
3. Click **Manage** (1), then **Licensing** (2) followed by **Assign License** and enter the license code for ESXi. A free ESXi license can be obtained directly [from VMware](https://my.vmware.com/en/group/vmware/evalcenter?p=free-esxi7&lp=default).
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-vmware_assign_license.webp" width="800" alt="" />
4. Validate the license. The license details are shown:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-vmware_license_added.webp" width="800" alt="" />

## Uploading ISO Files

The VMware ESXi hypervisor uses full virtualization for virtual machines. They can be installed directly from an [ISO file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_image), like a physical machine. To be able to launch the installation of virtual machines, ISO images have to be available in the local datastore.

1. From the ESXi dashboard, click **Storage** to view the storage dashboard. Click **Datastore Browser** to display the datastore content:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-vmware_datastore_dashboard.webp" width="800" alt="" />
2. Click **Upload** and choose an ISO file on your local computer to upload it to the datastore:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-vmware_datastore_upload.webp" width="800" alt="" />

## Creating Virtual Machines

1. Click **Virtual Machines** in the side menu to display the virtual machines dashboard. Click **Create / Register VM** to launch the virtual machine creation wizard:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-vmware_create_vm.webp" width="800" alt="" />
2. Select **Create a new virtual machine** and click **Next**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-vmware_create_vm_01.webp" width="800" alt="" />
3. Select a **name** and the **guest OS type** for the virtual machine:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-vmware_create_vm_02.webp" width="800" alt="" />

    Choose the settings according to your guest operating system. For Ubuntu Linux go with the following settings:

    - **Compatability**: `ESXi 7.0 virtual machine`
    - **Guest OS family**: `Linux`
    - **Guest OS version**: `Ubuntu Linux (64-bit)`
4. Select the datastore in which to store the configuration and disk files:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-vmware_create_vm_04_add_cdrom.webp" width="800" alt="" />

  The virtual machine settings display.
5. Set the amount of RAM and CPU cores according to your requirements. Click **Add other device** and choose **CD/DVD drive** from the list of options.
6. Click the **Network Adapter 1** to display the advanced settings. Set the **Mac Address** settings to **Manual** (1) and enter the **virtual MAC address** (2) associated with the failover IP of the virtual machine. Click **New CD/DVD Drive** to display the advanced settings. Choose **Datastore ISO file** from the drop-down menu. Click **Browse** (3) in the **CD/DVD Media** section to select the ISO file containing the operating system installer.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-vmware_create_vm_04_vmac_iso.webp" width="800" alt="" />

    A summary of the configuration displays.
7. Click **Finish** to start the creation of the virtual machine and to leave the configuration wizard:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-vmware_create_vm_05.webp" width="800" alt="" />
8. Tick the checkbox of the VM (1) on the virtual machine dashboard, then click **Power On** (2) to boot the virtual machine from the ISO file.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-vmware_start_vm.webp" width="800" alt="" />
9. Double-click the console preview to launch the console of the virtual machine. You can now run the installation of your operating system:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-vmware_install_os.webp" width="800" alt="" />

The network configuration of the virtual machine is done during the installation. Refer to the [network configuration documentation](/dedibox-network/ip-failover/quickstart/) to learn more about how to configure the networking on your operating system.
