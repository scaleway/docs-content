HTTP/2 offers significant improvements on HTTP/1.1 in terms of both performance and security.
HTTP/2 is now supported both at the frontend and the backend of Scaleway Load Balancers when TLS is enabled. No configuration is required to start using it. HTTP/2 is now enabled by default in all HTTP frontends, and backends with TLS configured and will automatically be used when supported by the client or backend server.

HTTP/3 is the next generation of HTTP protocol, built on top of QUIC.
HTTP/3 represents a big step forward for Internet performance and security. As this is a very new protocol, you have to enable HTTP/3 support if you wish to use it with a Scaleway Load Balancer. HTTP/3 is currently only supported at the frontend.
