[Private Networks](/network/vpc/concepts/#private-networks) allow your Elastic Metal servers to communicate in an isolated and secure network without needing to be connected to the public internet. This is an optional-billed feature, available with our Elastic Metal server ranges.

Each server can be connected to one or several Private Networks, letting you build your own network topologies. Private Networks' built-in DHCP server manages the allocation of private IP addresses for Elastic Metal servers (and other resources) when they are attached to the network.

Private Networks allow your Elastic Metal servers to communicate with other Scaleway resources in an isolated and secure network, without the need of being connected to the public internet.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance)

## How to enable and disable the Private Networks feature

    <Message type="important">
      The Private Networks feature must be enabled on a per-server basis. Note that only [Aluminium, Beryllium, and Lithium Elastic Metal servers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/elastic-metal/) are compatible with Private Networks.
    </Message>

You can enable/disable Private Networks on compatible Elastic Metal servers either during creation of the server, or afterward.

### During the creation of your Elastic Metal server

You can choose to enable the Private Networks feature during the [creation of your Elastic Metal server](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/create-server). Simply use the toggle icon <Icon name="toggle" /> when prompted by the creation wizard to enable the feature. If you do not enable the feature, it remains disabled by default.

### After the creation of your Elastic Metal server

1. Navigate to the **Elastic Metal servers** page of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/elastic-metal/servers). A list of your Elastic Metal servers displays.
2. Click the server for which you want to enable/disable the Private Networks feature. The server's **Overview** page displays.
3. Scroll to the **Private Networks feature** panel.
4. Click **Enable** or **Disable** to enable/disable the Private Networks feature as required.
5. Confirm the action when prompted.
    <Message type="note">
      Private Networks for Elastic Metal servers is a billable feature, and will be billed hourly or monthly depending on the type of Elastic Metal server you chose. If your Elastic Metal server is billed monthly and you disable the Private Networks feature after previously enabling it, you will still be billed for the feature for the current calendar month.

## How to attach and detach Elastic Metal servers to a Private Network

You can attach/detach Elastic Metal servers to a Private Network from either the Elastic Metal section of the console, or the VPC section.

### From the Elastic Metal section of the console

1. Navigate to the **Elastic Metal** page of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/elastic-metal/servers). A list of your Elastic Metal servers displays.
2. Click the server you want to attach/detach from a Private Network.
3. Click the **Private Networks** tab.
4. Click **Attach to a Private Network** and continue to step 5. Otherwise, to detach your server from a Private Network, click the <Icon type="unlink" /> icon next to the Private Network and confirm the action when prompted.
5. Either:
    - Select **Attach to an existing Private Network**, and choose a network from the drop-down list to attach your server to. Remember, only Private Networks in the same region as your server will be displayed.
    - Select **Attach to a new Private Network**, and enter a name for the new Private Network you wish to create.
    <Message type="note">
    The Private Network will have default settings, meaning:
      - It is created in your [default VPC](/network/vpc/concepts/#default-vpc) for the region
      - It has an auto-generated [CIDR block](/network/vpc/concepts/#cidr-block) used to allocate private IP addresses to servers attached to the network. Each attached Elastic Metal server will get an IPv4 and an IPv6 address on the Private Network.
    </Message>
6. Click **Attach Private Network** to confirm.

### From the VPC section of the console

Creating a new Private Network from the VPC section of the console allows you to control which VPC you create it in, and to optionally create a custom CIDR block for the network.

See our dedicated documentation [how to create a Private Network](/network/vpc/how-to/create-private-network/) and [how to attach resources](/network/vpc/how-to/attach-resources-to-pn/) from the VPC section of the console.

## How to configure the network interface on your Elastic Metal server for Private Networks

You must configure the virtual network interface on each Elastic Metal server you have added to a Private Network. Traffic from the public internet and traffic from a Private Network will pass through the same network interface of the Elastic Metal server. We must therefore separate the traffic by adding a VLAN interface.

<Message type="important">
  The following commands show how to configure the network interface on an Elastic Metal server running Ubuntu. For other operating systems, check the distributor's documentation.
</Message>

1. Make a note of your Elastic Metal server's VLAN ID. You can view this in the **Private Networks** tab of the Elastic Metal server in question.
2. [Connect to your Elastic Metal server via SSH](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/connect-to-server/).
3. Find the network interface using the `ip link show` command:
    ```bash
    ip link show
    ```
    The output will vary depending on the server, but here is an example:

    ```
    1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
      link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    2: eno1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
        link/ether 9c:b6:54:bb:6c:64 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    3: eno2: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
        link/ether 9c:b6:54:bb:6c:65 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    ```

    In this case, the network interface is identified by `eno1`.
4. Enter the following command to add a virtual link to the network interface. Replace `1234` with the VLAN ID you noted down in step 1 and `eno1` (if necessary) with the relevant network interface name identified in step 3.
    ```bash
    sudo ip link add link eno1 name eno1.1234 type vlan id 1234
    ```
5. Enter the following command to bring up the virtual link. Make the necessary replacements for `eno1` and `1234` as you did previously.
    ```
    sudo ip link set eno1.1234 up
    ```

    If DHCP is [activated on your Private Network](/network/vpc/how-to/activate-dhcp/) and you are using a DHCP client, you do not need to continue to the next step. Your Elastic Metal server should be assigned an IP address which is compatible with our [internal IPAM](/network/vpc/concepts/#ipam).
    
    If you have not activated DHCP or do not have a DHCP client, proceed to the next step to manually configure an IP address.

    <Message type="important">
    If you are running multiple virtual machines on an Elastic Metal server, our managed DHCP is not currently able to distribute IP addresses to your virtual machines. We recommend that you use the [IPAM API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/ipam/) to book IP addresses for your virtual machines, and assign them manually.
    </Message>

6. Enter the following command to assign an IP address. Make the necessary replacements for `eno1` and `1234` as you did previously.
    ```bash
    sudo ip addr add 10.10.10.10/24 dev eno1.1234
    ```
7. Optionally persist this configuration across reboots by creating a new netplan configuration. Make the necessary replacements for `eno1` and `1234` as you did previously.
    ```yaml
    # e.g.: /etc/netplan/51-private-networks.yaml
    network:
      version: 2
      vlans:
        eno1.1234:
          id: 1234
          link: eno1
          addresses:
            - 10.10.10.10/24
    ```
    <Message type="tip">
      You might want to use the `sudo netplan try` command to test your configuration before applying it. Apply the configuration with `sudo netplan apply`.

## How to configure the Private Network on Windows Server 2019

1. Log into your server as `Administrateur` using the Remote Desktop client.
    <Message type="note">
      The default language of Windows Server installations is French. Make sure to use the user `Administrateur` when connecting to your server. If required, you can [change the language of the operating system](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/change-win-server-language).
    </Message>
2. Launch the **Server Manager** application.
3. Click **Local Server** in the menu on the left. Then click **NIC Teaming** in the **Properties** section.
4. Click **Tasks** > **New Team**. Enter a team name of your choice (e.g. `default`) and tick the checkbox **NIC1**. Then click **OK**.
5. Select the **Team interfaces** tab in the **Adapters and Interfaces** section. Click **Tasks** > **Add interface**. A pop-up displays.
6. Enter a name for the new interface (e.g. `default - VLAN 1234` if your VLAN ID is 1234). Select **Specific VLAN** and enter the ID of your VLAN (e.g. 1234). Click **OK** to confirm.
    <Message type="important">
      Two network interfaces display: Your VLAN and `default`. Make sure to keep the default network, otherwise you will lose access to your server via the public internet.
    </Message>
7. Click **Start** > **Execute** and type `ncpa.cpl`. Then click **OK** to open the network connection manager.
8. Click on your VLAN network connection and right-click on it to open the menu. Click **Properties** to display the connection properties.
