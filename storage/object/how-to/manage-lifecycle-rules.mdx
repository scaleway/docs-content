With the Scaleway Console, you can either transfer objects to `GLACIER` class [manually](/storage/object/how-to/change-object-class/) or automatically with lifecycle rules. These rules also allow users to set expiration dates for objects and object versions.

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)  
  - You have [created an Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)

</Message>

## How to create a lifecycle rule
1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the name of your bucket.
3. Click **Lifecycle Rules**. 
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-lifecycle-rule.png" alt="" />

4. Click **+ Create Lifecycle Rule** to add a rule.
5. Enter a name for the rule.
6. Filter the objects you want the rule to be applied to by one or both of the following criteria:
    - **Prefix**: this criteria is based on the object name. The defined rule will be applied to all objects with the same name prefix.
    - **Tags**: comprised of a **key** and a **value** associated with the Key. These tags should be defined prior to the rule creation, for either a bucket or an object. You can add one or more tags to your filter. 

  If you wish to change the storage class of two or more objects at a time, you can set up a transition rule that will automate the process.

7. Check the box if you wish to transfer the current version of the objects to `GLACIER` a number of days after its creation. 

8. Click **-** or **+** to adjust the timeframe, or type in the exact amount. 
  <Message type="tip">

    Expiration rules work in similar fashion, objects can be set to be permanently deleted after a given period of time.

  </Message>

9. Check the boxes or leave them empty for each case according to your preference. A summary of your rule preferences displays on the bottom of the **Expiration Rules** step page.

10. Check that all settings are correct and click **Create Lifecycle Rule** to confirm.

A list of the lifecycle rules displays.

## How to disable a lifecycle rule


1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. A list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the name of your bucket.
3. Click the **Lifecycle Rules** tab. A list of your rules displays.
4. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to name of the rule. 
5. Click **Disable**.
  A confirmation window pops up. 
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-disable-rule.png" alt="" />
6. Enter **Disable Rule** if you wish to pursue the action.

Once disabled, the lifecycle rule remains listed and can be enabled again. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Activate** to do so. 

If you wish to permanently delete a rule, click  <Icon name="more" /> > **Delete**.
