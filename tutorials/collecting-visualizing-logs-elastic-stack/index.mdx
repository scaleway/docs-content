ELK is a bundle of three open-source software projects maintained by [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/). Elastic has recently included a family of log shippers called **Beats** and renamed the stack as **Elastic Stack**. The solution is flexible and is mostly used to centralize logging requirements.

The ELK stack consists of: 

  - [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch), a NoSQL database based on the Lucene search engine.
  - [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash), a server-side data processing pipeline that accepts data from various sources simultaneously, transforms it, and exports the data to various targets.
  - [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana), a visualization layer that works on top of Elasticsearch.

</Message>

## Installing the ELK stack

1. Install Java. In this tutorial, we use the [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/) package.
    ```
    apt install -y openjdk-8-jdk
    ```
2. Install the Elastic GPG Key to validate the packages.
    ```
    wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | apt-key add -
    ```
3. Install HTTPS transport to download the packages over a secure connection.
    ```
    apt install -y apt-transport-https
    ```
4. Add the Elastic repository to the APT configuration.
    ```
    echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg] https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/8.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-8.x.list
    ```
5. Update APT and install Elasticsearch.
    ```
    apt update && apt install -y elasticsearch
    ```
6. Uncomment and edit the following lines in the `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml` file to reflect the example below. This will limit the Elasticsearch connection to **localhost**.
    ```
    network.host: 127.0.0.1
    http.port:9200
    ```
7. Install Logstash and rsyslog.
    ```
    apt install -y logstash rsyslog
    ```
8. Install Filebeat.
    ```
    apt install -y filebeat
    ```
9. Install Kibana.
    ```
    apt install -y kibana
    ```
10. Start Elasticsearch:
    ```
    systemctl start elasticsearch.service
    ```
11. Run the following command to verify whether Elasticsearch is running:
    ```
    curl -X GET "localhost:9200"
    ```
    The output should be similar to this example:

    ```
    {
      "name" : "elastic-stack",
      "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
      "cluster_uuid" : "LiIyk5P1TMuR6MqOWcs_DQ",
      "version" : {
        "number" : "7.8.0",
        "build_flavor" : "default",
        "build_type" : "deb",
        "build_hash" : "757314695644ea9a1dc2fecd26d1a43856725e65",
        "build_date" : "2020-06-14T19:35:50.234439Z",
        "build_snapshot" : false,
        "lucene_version" : "8.5.1",
        "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "6.8.0",
        "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "6.0.0-beta1"
      },
      "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
    }
    ```
12. Open the file `/etc/kibana/kibana.yml` and uncomment the following lines:
    ```
    server.port: 5601
    server.host: "localhost"
    elasticsearch.hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]
    ```

    Save and exit.
13. Enable and start the Kibana service in systemd:
    ```
    systemctl enable kibana.service
    systemctl start kibana.service
    ```
14. Install nginx as a proxy to Kibana:
    ```
    apt install -y nginx
    ```
15. Use OpenSSL to create a user and password for the Elastic Stack interface. This command generates a `htpasswd` file, containing the user `kibana` and a password you are prompted to create.
    ```
    echo "kibana:`openssl passwd -apr1`" | tee -a /etc/nginx/htpasswd.users
    ```
16. Edit the `/etc/nginx/sites-available/elastic.local` file and paste the following content to create a proxy to Kibana. 
    <Message type="important">
      Replace `elastic.local` with the domain name of your Instance:
    </Message>

    ```
        server {
          listen 80;
          server_name elastic.local;

          auth_basic "Restricted Access";
          auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/htpasswd.users;

          location / {
            proxy_pass         http://localhost:5601;
            proxy_redirect     off;

            proxy_set_header   Host              $host;
            proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
          }

        }
    ```
17. Create a symbolic link to enable the site in nginx:
    ```
    ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/elastic.local /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/elastic.local
    ```
18. Reload the nginx configuration to activate the proxy:
    ```
    systemctl restart nginx.service
    ```

You can now access your Elastic Dashboard using your domain name, for example `http://elastic.local`:

<Lightbox src="scaleway-elasticstack.webp" alt="" />

You can either start with an empty stack and start collecting your metrics or load sample data.

## Configuring rsyslog

Edit the file `/etc/rsyslog.conf`, uncomment the following lines and save.

  ```
  # provides UDP syslog reception
  module(load="imudp")
  input(type="imudp" port="514")
  ```

## Configuring Logstash

Logstash allows you to collect data from different sources, transform it into a common format, and to export it to a defined destination.

Logstash configuration files are written in JSON and can be found in the `/etc/logstash/conf.d` directory.

1. Configure a Filebeat input in the configuration file `02-beats-input.conf`:
    ```
    nano /etc/logstash/conf.d/02-beats-input.conf
    ```

    Copy the following information into the file, save and close it. This configuration allows the `beats` input to listen on port `5044`:

    ```
    input {
      beats {
        port => 5044
      }
    }
    ```
2. Create a file named `/etc/logstash/conf.d/10-syslog-filter.conf` and paste the following contents.
    ```
    filter {
      if [type] == "syslog" {
        grok {
          match => { "message" => "%{SYSLOGTIMESTAMP:syslog_timestamp} %{SYSLOGHOST:syslog_hostname} %{DATA:syslog_program}(?:\[%{POSINT:syslog_pid}\])?: %{GREEDYDATA:syslog_message}" }
          add_field => [ "received_at", "%{@timestamp}" ]
          add_field => [ "received_from", "%{host}" ]
        }
        syslog_pri { }
        date {
          match => [ "syslog_timestamp", "MMM  d HH:mm:ss", "MMM dd HH:mm:ss" ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    Save and close.

    <Message type="note">
      This filter parses incoming system logs to make them structured and usable by the Kibana Dashboards. For more information refer to the [official Elastic documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/6.x/logstash-config-for-filebeat-modules.html#parsing-system).
    </Message> 
3. Create another file named `/etc/logstash/conf.d/30-elasticsearch-output.conf`, and copy the following content. Then, save and exit.
    ```
      output {
        elasticsearch {
          hosts => ["localhost:9200"]
          manage_template => false
          index => "%{[@metadata][beat]}-%{[@metadata][version]}-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
          document_type => "%{[@metadata][type]}"
        }
      }
    ```

    The output rules defined in this file send the data to Elasticsearch, which runs at port 9200 on `localhost`. It also stores the data in an index named after the Beat used.

    <Message type="note">
      In case you want to add filters that use the Filebeat input, make sure these filters are named between the input and output configuration (between `02` and `30`).
    </Message>
4. Start and enable the Filebeat service:
    ```
    systemctl start logstash.service
    systemctl enable logstash.service
    ```

## Configuring Filebeat

The Elastic Stack uses lightweight data shippers (called [Beats](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats)) to collect data from various sources and transport them to Logstash or Elasticsearch. In this tutorial we show how to integrate your machine with Elastic using the [Filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/filebeat) Beats client. 

Other Beats are available, for example: [Metricbeat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/metricbeat) to collect metrics of systems and services, [Packetbeat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/packetbeat) to analize network traffic or [Heartbeat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/heartbeat) to monitor the availability of services.

1. Open the Filebeat configuration:
    ```
    nano /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      The file is written in [YAML](http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) format and it is important that you respect the formatting rules when you edit the file.
    </Message>
2. Add the following configuration for syslog in the `filebeat.inputs` section of the file:
    ```yml
    - 
    protocol.udp: 
      host: "localhost:514"
    type: syslog
    ```
3. Search for `output.elasticsearch` and comment-out the lines as follows:
    ```
    [...]
    #output.elasticsearch:
      # Array of hosts to connect to.
      #hosts: ["localhost:9200"]
    [...]
    ```
4. Search for `output.logstash` and uncomment the lines as follows:
    ```
    [...]
    output.logstash:
      # The Logstash hosts
      hosts: ["localhost:5044"]
    [...]
    ```
5. Enable the [system plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/6.4/filebeat-module-system.html) to handle generic system log files with Filebeat. Enable the plugin:
    ```
    filebeat modules enable system
    ```

    <Message type = "note">
      Filebeat uses [different modules](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/6.4/filebeat-modules.html) to parse different log files. You can keep the default configuration of the module for this tutorial. If you want to learn more about the parsing rules applied, you may check the configuration of the module located at `/etc/filebeat/modules.d/system.yml`.
    </Message>
6. Load the index template into Elasticsearch:
    ```
    filebeat setup --template -E output.logstash.enabled=false -E 'output.elasticsearch.hosts=["localhost:9200"]'
    ```
7. Disable the Logstash output and enable the Elasticsearch output to load the dashboards when Logstash is enabled:
    ```
    filebeat setup -e -E output.logstash.enabled=false -E output.elasticsearch.hosts=['localhost:9200'] -E setup.kibana.host=localhost:5601
    ```

    An output similar to the following displays:

    ```
    [...]

8. You can now start and enable the Filebeat service:
    ```
    systemctl start filebeat.service
    systemctl enable filebeat.service
    ```

9. Run the following command to verify that your Filebeat service is running:
    ```
    curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/filebeat-*/_search?pretty'
    ```

    The output should look like the following example:

## Exploring Kibana

The data collected by your setup is now available in Kibana.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-elasticsyslog.webp" alt="" />

Use the menu on the left to navigate to the **Dashboard** page and search for **Filebeat** System dashboards. 

You can browse the sample dashboards included with Kibana or create your dashboards based on the metrics you want to monitor.

For more information how to use the Elastic stack, refer to the [official documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/index.html).
