This page shows you how to manage a container, in order to verify or edit its deployment parameters after creation. You can deploy a container from the [Scaleway Container Registry](/container-registry/quickstart/) or any other public container registry, such as Docker Hub, AWS Container registries, GitLab container registry, etc.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Deployed a container](/serverless-containers/how-to/deploy-container/)

## How to manage a container deployment

### Manage a deployment from the Scaleway Container Registry

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The Containers page displays.
2. Click the relevant containers namespace.
3. Click the name of the container you want to manage, then select the **Settings** tab.
4. In the **Container image** section:
    - Select the **Scaleway** Container Registry.
    - Choose an **image** from your Container Registry. Select the required Container Registry namespace from the drop-down list, and then select the container and tag.
    - Choose the [port](/serverless-containers/concepts/#port) your container is listening on. We recommend configuring your container to listen on the **PORT** environment variable.
5. In the **Resources** section, select the vCPU and memory to allocate to your container at runtime. These values define the performance characteristics of your container.
6. Set your [autoscaling](/serverless-containers/) preferences, or leave them at default values. The Scaleway platform automatically scales the number of available instances of your container to match the incoming load, depending on the settings you define here.
7. In the **Advanced options** section, check or edit any of the following:
    <Tabs>
    <TabsTab label="Data">
    - Declare [environment variables](/serverless-containers/concepts/#environment-variables) you want to inject into your container. For each environment variable, click **+Add variable** and enter the key/value pair.
    - Declare [secrets](/serverless-containers/concepts/#secrets) for your container. Secrets are environment variables that are injected into your container, but the values are not retained or displayed by Scaleway after initial validation.
          <Message type="note">
          Encode your environment variables and secrets to `base64` if they are too large, and contain carriage returns.
          </Message>
    </TabsTab>
    <TabsTab label="Security">
      - Set the desired [privacy policy](/serverless-containers/concepts/#privacy-policy) for your container. This defines whether container invocation may be done anonymously (**public**) or only via an authentication mechanism provided by the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-containers/#authentication) (**private**).
      - Tick the box under **HTTPS connections only** to prevent your container from being called from insecure HTTP connections.
    </TabsTab>
    <TabsTab label="Requests">
    - Set a custom [timeout](/serverless-containers/concepts/#timeout) for the duration of the requests received by your container.
    - Tick the box under [HTTP protocol](/serverless-containers/concepts/#protocol) to listen to HTTP/2 requests if it is required by your application. Otherwise, we recommend you use HTTP/1.
    </TabsTab>
    <TabsTab label="Performances">
    - Select a [sandbox](/serverless-containers/concepts/#sandbox) version:
        - Sandbox v2 for shorter cold starts (recommended).
        - Sandbox v1 if you require full compatibility with the Linux system call interface (legacy).
    </TabsTab>
    <TabsTab label="Health checks">
      - Update the [health check](/serverless-containers/concepts/#health-check) behavior according to your needs:
        - **Probe type**: TCP, or HTTP
        - **Health checks intervals**: 5s - 120s (default: 30s)
        - **Failure threshold**: 3 - 50 (default: 10)
    </TabsTab>
    <TabsTab label="Storage">
    - Modify the [ephemeral storage](/serverless-containers/concepts/#ephemeral-storage) according to your needs.
    </TabsTab>
    </Tabs>
8. Click **Deploy container** to save any changes you have made.

### Manage a deployment from an external container registry

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The Containers page displays.
2. Click the relevant containers namespace.
3. Click the name of the container you want to manage, then select the **Settings** tab.
4. In the **Container image** section:
    - Select the **External** container registry.
    - Enter the public container **image URL** provided by the external registry.
    - Choose the [port](/serverless-containers/concepts/#port)  your container is listening on. We recommend configuring your container to listen on the **PORT** environment variable.
5. In the **Resources** section, select the vCPU and memory to allocate to your container at runtime. These values define the performance characteristics of your container.
6. Set your [autoscaling](/serverless-containers/) preferences, or leave them at default values. The Scaleway platform automatically scales the number of available instances of your container to match the incoming load, depending on the settings you define here.
