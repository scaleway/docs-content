    <Message type="important">
      Scaleway does not support the `.be` TLD. Refer to the [list of TLDs supported by Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/en/domains-name/) or manually check that the TLD exists by following the 4 first steps documented in the [How to register an internal domain documentation](/domains-and-dns/how-to/register-internal-domain/). If the TLD you want to transfer is not displayed in the list of available domains, Scaleway does not support it.
