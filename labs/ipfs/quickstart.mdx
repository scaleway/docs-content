IPFS is a protocol, made by [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/), for decentralized storage and content sharing.

You can leverage our IPFS pinning service to store permanently your data on the public IPFS network. You can [create](/labs/ipfs/api-cli/volumes-operations) and manage your Volumes and Pins from the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/login), via the [API](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/instance/api/) or via the [Scaleway Command Line Interface](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli).

## Scaleway Command Line Interface Overview

[The Scaleway Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli) allows you to pilot your Scaleway infrastructure directly from your terminal, providing a faster way to administer and monitor your resources. Scaleway CLI is easy to set up and use, and an essential tool for operating efficiently in your cloud environment. The CLI provides many functionalities, including the ability to create and manage Volumes and Pins.

## How to create an IPFS volume

A volume serves as a storage area for a set of pins, they are like Object Storage buckets.

Create your volume with the CLI:
```
scw ipfs volume create project-id=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 name=MyVolume
```

**Sample response**
```
ID         11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
ProjectID  00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
Region     fr-par
CountPin   0
CreatedAt  now
UpdatedAt  now
Name       MyVolume
```

## How to pin a CID in your volume storage IPFS

Now that we have a volume, we can pin content from CIDs (content identifier) and URLs to it. Let's see how it works with an CID.

<Message type="note">
  It suppose that the content pointed by the CID must already be present on the public IPFS network.
</Message>

1. Add content by CID.
  ```
  scw ipfs ipfs add-cid volume-id=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111 cid=QmQ6znATkFZdgniHofhFUSm3imBWN5yf5yiU5sLp56VRCu name=MyPinByCID
  ```
2. Check the status of your CID to see if the content is pinned at Scaleway.
  ```
  scw ipfs ipfs get-pin-id pin-id=22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222 volume-id=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
  ```

**Response**
```
Status          pinned
CreatedAt       5 minutes ago
Cid.Cid         QmQ6znATkFZdgniHofhFUSm3imBWN5yf5yiU5sLp56VRCu
Cid.Name        value:"MyPinByCID"
Cid.Meta.AppID  00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

## How to unpin a content

If you no longer want to store a content, you can delete it by indicating the pin-id to remove.

<Message type="note">
  If you were the last owner of the content, it will be removed from Scaleway's storage.
</Message>

Delete a content by indicating the pin-id.
```
scw ipfs ipfs rm-pin-id pin-id=22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222 volume-id=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
```

## How to delete a volume

It is possible to delete the entire volume, which removes all attached pins.

Delete volume storage.
```
scw ipfs volume delete volume-id=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
```
