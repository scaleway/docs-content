## Rclone crypt - Overview

Rclone is an open-source command-line tool to manage files on cloud storage. It is written in the [Go](https://golang.org/) programming language and supports a wide range of protocols. The tool provides virtual backends to wrap local and cloud file systems to apply encryption, caching, chunking, and joining.

Rclone is available for Windows, macOS X and various Linux distributions.

In this tutorial we use the [rlcone crypt](https://rclone.org/crypt/) module to encrypt your data before sending it to [Scaleway Object Storage](https://www.scaleway.com/en/object-storage/) via the S3 protocol.

## Installing rclone

You can install `rclone` on your local computer using the pre-built binary files provided. Follow the steps for your computers' operating system:

#### Windows
On Windows, you can download the latest version of rclone [from their website](https://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-current-windows-amd64.zip).
Unpack the ZIP file to launch the application.

#### macOS
On MacOS you can install `rclone` using the [brew](https://brew.sh/) package manager:
```
brew install rclone
```

#### Linux:

1. Start by downloading the current version of `rclone` from their website and unpack the zip file:
    ```
    wget https://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-current-linux-amd64.zip
    unzip rclone-current-linux-amd64.zip
    cd rclone-*-linux-amd64
    ```
2. Copy binary file in the `/usr/bin` directory:
    ```
    sudo cp rclone /usr/bin/
    sudo chown root:root /usr/bin/rclone
    sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/rclone
    ```
3. Install the `rclone` manpage for additional software documentation:
    ```
    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/man/man1
    sudo cp rclone.1 /usr/local/share/man/man1/
    sudo mandb
    ```

## Configuring a S3 remote endpoint

<Message type="important">
  You need to have your [API key](/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key/) ready for the `rclone` configuration.
</Message>

Before encrypting your data, create a new remote S3 endpoint in rclone using the `rclone config` command:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/r/c/s/q> n
name> scaleway
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[...]
  4 / Amazon S3 Compliant Storage Provider (AWS, Alibaba, Ceph, Digital Ocean, Dreamhost, IBM COS, Minio, etc)
  \ "s3"
[...]

Leave blank for anonymous access or runtime credentials.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
secret_access_key> <SECRET_KEY>
Region to connect to.
Leave blank if you are using an S3 clone and you don't have a region.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
  1 / Use this if unsure. Will use v4 signatures and an empty region.
    \ ""
  2 / Use this only if v4 signatures don't work, eg pre Jewel/v10 CEPH.
    \ "other-v2-signature"
region> fr-par
Endpoint for S3 API.
Required when using an S3 clone.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
endpoint> https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud
Location constraint - must be set to match the Region.
Leave blank if not sure. Used when creating buckets only.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
location_constraint> fr-par
Canned ACL used when creating buckets and storing or copying objects.

This ACL is used for creating objects and if bucket_acl isn't set, for creating buckets too.

For more info visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl

Note that this ACL is applied when server side copying objects as S3
doesn't copy the ACL from the source but rather writes a fresh one.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").

### Configuring rclone crypt

`rclone crypt` will use the previously configured endpoint to store the encrypted files. Configure it by running `rclone config` again.

In the config below we define the Object Storage bucket at the `remote` prompt. In our example, we use our S3 endpoint `scaleway` with the bucket `myobjectstoragebucket`. 

Edit these values towards your configuration. A long passphrase is recommended for security reasons, or you can use a random one.

```
$ rclone config
Current remotes:

Name                 Type
====                 ====
scaleway             s3


e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/r/c/s/q> n
name> secret
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[...]
10 / Encrypt/Decrypt a remote
  \ "crypt"
[...]
Storage> crypt
** See help for crypt backend at: https://rclone.org/crypt/ **

Remote to encrypt/decrypt.
Normally should contain a ':' and a path, eg "myremote:path/to/dir",
"myremote:bucket" or maybe "myremote:" (not recommended).
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
remote> scaleway:myobjectstoragebucket
How to encrypt the filenames.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("standard").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
  1 / Encrypt the filenames see the docs for the details.
    \ "standard"
  2 / Very simple filename obfuscation.
    \ "obfuscate"
  3 / Don't encrypt the file names.  Adds a ".bin" extension only.
    \ "off"
filename_encryption> standard
Option to either encrypt directory names or leave them intact.
Enter a boolean value (true or false). Press Enter for the default ("true").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
  1 / Encrypt directory names.
    \ "true"
  2 / Don't encrypt directory names, leave them intact.
    \ "false"
directory_name_encryption> true
Password or pass phrase for encryption.
y) Yes type in my own password
g) Generate random password
y/g> g
Password strength in bits.
64 is just about memorable
128 is secure
1024 is the maximum
Bits> 1024
Your password is: <YOUR_PASSWORD>
Use this password? Please note that an obscured version of this
password (and not the password itself) will be stored under your
configuration file, so keep this generated password in a safe place.
y) Yes (default)
n) No
y/n> y
Password or pass phrase for salt. Optional but recommended.
Should be different to the previous password.
y) Yes type in my own password
g) Generate random password

### Sending encrypted data

You can send encrypted data to your Object Storage bucket using the `secret` endpoint which acts like a proxy, encrypting your data, before uploading it into your bucket.

For example, if you want to upload your personal photo album and want to protect your privacy, you can encrypt the files in the directory by running the following command:

```
$ rclone copy --progress --s3-chunk-size=20M /home/myuser/MyPhotoalbum secret:/encrypted/MyPhotoalbum
```

It will transfer the directory `/home/myuser/MyPhotoalbum` to the endpoint `secret` and upload the data in the sub-directory `/encrypted/MyPhotoalbum`. The flags `--progress` display the status of the file transfer and `--s3-chunk-size=20` sets the maximum size for each part of a [multipart upload](/storage/object/api-cli/multipart-uploads) to 20MB.

You can check if the data has been encrypted when running a `ls` command on the `scaleway` endpoint. It will return a list like the following:

```
$ rclone -q ls scaleway:myobjectstoragebucket
    552 3o60qe8adn5et0u45v2tidlrps/1qam1krvtvh27lapdj6s1uqbs8
    2725 3o60qe8adn5et0u45v2tidlrps/1sourbh9g9fhed0qno6uc448sdgp4okr89hvba7tsbb72oekgc70
    8244 3o60qe8adn5et0u45v2tidlrps/47bofkrpan3ppnmapi5j724jeg
    46202 3o60qe8adn5et0u45v2tidlrps/5su2ovf4mpcpgis5sll65iloasrshulp7drbpjrlpfobhh8k8qvg
    34607 3o60qe8adn5et0u45v2tidlrps/dredhm7otgba2s25nbdq2chqtpbvcqq2oum1b404mpim24dfg5ig
```

If you run the same command on the `secret` endpoint, `rclone crypt` will decrypt the files and return their actual names:

```
$ rclone -q ls secret:
    504 Pictures/Picture1.png
    2677 Pictures/Picture2.png
    8196 Pictures/Picture3.png
    46154 Pictures/Picture4.png
    34559 Pictures/Picture5.png
```

Note that `rclone crypt` keeps the directory structure, but encrypts both the file and folder names.

### Restoring encrypted data

Decryption of data stored using `rclone copy` works the same way as the encryption process:

```
rclone copy --progress secret:/encrypted/MyPhotoalbum /home/myuser/restored_data/MyPhotoalbum
```

You are now able to encrypt and decrypt your data on Scaleway Object Storage using `rclone crpyt`. For more information about the `crypt` endpoint, refer to the official [rclone documentation](https://rclone.org/crypt/).
