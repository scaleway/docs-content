Scaleway Instances provide you with resources to develop, test code and deploy your applications in no time. Instances are designed for modern workflows. They are with you from prototyping to large-scale deployment. You can [create](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance) and manage your Instances from the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/login), via the [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/) or via the [Scaleway Command Line Interface](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli).

## Scaleway Command Line Interface Overview

[The Scaleway Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli) allows you to pilot your Scaleway infrastructure directly from your terminal, providing a faster way to administer and monitor your resources. Scaleway CLI is easy to set up and use, and an essential tool for operating efficiently in your cloud environment. The CLI provides many functionalities, including the ability to create and manage Instances.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
  - You have configured your [SSH key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
  - You have generated your [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
  - You have downloaded and installed the [Scaleway CLI v2](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli#scaleway-cli-v2)
</Message>

## Configuring the CLI

1. Open a terminal and type the following command to configure the Scaleway CLI on your machine:

    `scw init`

    If you have already configured the CLI, you will see a message similar to the following:

    ```
    Current config is located at /path/to/config.yaml
    access_key: <YOUR ACCESS KEY>
    secret_key: <YOUR SECRET KEY>
    default_organization_id: <YOUR ORGANIZATION ID>
    default_project_id: <YOUR PROJECT ID>
    default_region: <YOUR DEFAULT REGION, eg fr-par>
    default_zone: <YOUR DEFAULT ZONE, eg fr-par-1>

    Do you want to override the current config? (Y/n):
    ```
2. Unless you want to change your configuration, you can type `n` and go directly to the [Creating an Instance](#creating-an-instance) step of this tutorial.

    If you have not yet configured the CLI, you will be guided through the configuration process via a series of questions:

    ```
    Enter a valid secret-key or an email
    ```
3. Enter either the email address for your account (you will then be asked for your password), or your [API Secret Key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/):
    ```
    To improve this tool we rely on diagnostic and usage data.
    Sending such data is optional and can be disabled at any time by running "scw config set send-telemetry=false".
    Do you want to send usage statistics and diagnostics? (Y/n):
    ```

    Type `y` or `n` and hit enter.

    ```
    To fully enjoy Scaleway CLI we recommend you install autocomplete support in your shell.
    Do you want to install autocomplete? (Y/n):
    ```
    Type `y` or `n` and hit enter.

    ```
    To enable autocomplete, scw needs to update your shell configuration.
    What type of shell are you using (default: zsh):
    ```
4. Hit enter if the default shell type is already correct for you. Otherwise, enter your shell type and hit enter.
    ```
    To enable autocomplete we need to append to /Users/yourusername/.zshrc the following lines:
    # Scaleway CLI autocomplete initialization.
    eval "$(scw autocomplete script shell=zsh)"
    Do you want to proceed with these changes? (Y/n):
    ```

    Type `y` or `n` and hit enter. This should complete the configuration process:

    ```
    Initialization completed with success.
    ```

## Creating an Instance

1. Type the following command in your terminal to obtain a local-image UUID:

    `scw marketplace image get label=ubuntu_focal`

    A list of local-images UUIDs from marketplace images displays: 

    ```
    Image:
    Label             ubuntu_focal
    Name              Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa
    ModificationDate  3 months ago
    CreationDate      2 years ago

    ```
2. Run the following command to create an Instance:

    `scw instance server create zone=xx-xxx-x image=ubuntu_focal`

    <Message type="note">
      Replace `xx-xxx-x` with the Availability Zone you want to create your Instance in. If you want your Availability Zone to be in Paris for example, use `fr-par-1`. Refer to our [documentation](/compute/instances/concepts/#availability-zone) for more information about Availability Zones.

## Creating an Instance local volume

1. Run the following command to create an Instance volume with a size of 50 GB:

    `scw instance volume create size=50GB name=my-volume`

    You will see an output like the following:

    ```
    ID                12345678-1234-1234-4321-123456789123
    Name              my-volume
    ExportURI         -

    State             available
    Zone              fr-par-1
    ```
2. Write down the ID of your Instance. You will need it in the next steps.

## Creating and attaching a block volume to an Instance

<Message type="important">
  Block volumes are only available for `DEV1`, `GP1` and `RENDER` offers.
</Message>

1. Run the following command to create a [block volume](/compute/instances/concepts/#block-volumes/): 

    `scw instance volume create size=10GB volume-type=b_ssd`

    Your block volume has been created:
    ```
    ID                12345678-1234-1234-4321-123456789123
    Name              cli-vol-albattani
    ExportURI         -
    Size              10 GB
    VolumeType        b_ssd

    State             available
    ```
2. Write down your block volume's ID. You will need it in the next steps.
3. Type the following command in your terminal to attach your block volume to your Instance. Make sure you replace `n4m3-0f-y0Ur-s3rv3r-id` by your server ID and `n4m3-0f-y0Ur-volume-id` by your volume ID.

    `scw instance server attach-volume server-id=n4m3-0f-y0Ur-s3rv3r-id volume-id=n4m3-0f-y0Ur-volume-id`

    You will see an output similar to the following:

    ```

## Powering off an Instance

Type the following command in your terminal and replace "your-server" with the ID of your server.

`scw instance server stop your-server`

You will see the following output:

```
Poweroff successful for the server.
```

Your Instance has been powered off.

## Deleting an Instance

<Message type="important">
  This action will delete all your volumes and data located on your storage server. To avoid losing data, it is recommended to perform regular snapshots.
</Message>

Ensure your Instance is powered off and then run the following command, replacing "your-server" with the ID of your server.

`scw instance server delete your-server`

You will see the following output:

```
successfully deleted volume ubuntu_20.04_focal_fossa:volume-0 (20 GB l_ssd)
```
