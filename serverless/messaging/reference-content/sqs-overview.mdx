## What is SQS?

SQS is a managed messaging service developed by AWS and supported by Scaleway Messaging and Queuing. It is often coupled to work with [SNS](/serverless/messaging/reference-content/sns-overview/).

SQS (Simple Queue Service) became generally available in 2006. It is a highly scalable [queuing](/serverless/messaging/concepts#queuing) service that facilitates the decoupling of software systems. Scaleway Messaging and Queuing provides a gateway that enables you to connect your existing applications without having to significantly modify your code baseline.

  Some SQS features are not yet supported. Refer to our [dedicated documentation page](/serverless/messaging/reference-content/sqs-support/) for more information.

## Activating SQS

Before you can start using SQS with Scaleway Messaging and Queuing, you must first activate it. You can do this in a few clicks from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) by [following our how-to](/serverless/messaging/how-to/get-started/). Alternatively, you can also use the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/messaging-and-queuing/).

## SQS Credentials

Once you have activated SQS, the next step is to [create credentials](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-credentials) that give your applications permission to connect to the Scaleway Messaging and Queuing service.

Credentials are scoped to your SQS service at [Project](/console/my-project/concepts/#project)-level. You can choose to give each set of credentials the required level of permissions:

  - **Read**: receive messages from queues and topics.
  - **Write**: send messages to queues and publish in topics.
  - **Manage**: create or edit resources (such as queues and topics).

## SQS Queues

You can [create queues](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-queues/) via the Scaleway console. You can choose to create either a Standard or FIFO queue, and tweak parameters such as visibility timeout, message retention period, maximum message size and content based deduplication.

## Further actions

All further actions including creating, listing and managing queues, sending messages etc. can be done using the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs. Check out our documentation to help you get started with the [AWS CLI](/serverless/messaging/api-cli/connect-aws-cli/) or [AWS SDKs](/serverless/messaging/api-cli/python-node-sqs/).
