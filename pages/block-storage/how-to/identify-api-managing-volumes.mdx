You can manage Block Storage resources using either the [Block Storage API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/block/), or the [Instances API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/).

This page shows you how to identify the API that manages your volumes and snapshots using the Scaleway console. Refer to our [dedicated documentation](/block-storage/api-cli/identifying-volume-snapshot-api/) to learn how to identify the API managing your volumes and snapshots using the API and CLI.

- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created [Block Storage volumes](/block-storage/how-to/create-a-volume/)
- Created [snapshots](/block-storage/how-to/create-a-snapshot/)
