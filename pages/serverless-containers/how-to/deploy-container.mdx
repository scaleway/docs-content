This page shows you how to deploy Serverless Containers using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/).

You can deploy a container from the [Scaleway Container Registry](/container-registry/quickstart/), or any other public container registry, such as Docker Hub, AWS Container registries, GitLab container registry, etc.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a containers namespace](/serverless-containers/how-to/create-manage-delete-containers-namespace/)
- [Created a Container Registry namespace](/container-registry/how-to/create-namespace/) and [pushed a container image](/container-registry/how-to/push-images/) to it

## Deploy from the Scaleway Container Registry

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The containers page displays.
2. Click the relevant container's namespace.
3. Click **Deploy container**. The container creation wizard displays.

### Container image configuration

1. Select the **Scaleway** Container Registry.

2. Choose an [image](/serverless-containers/concepts/#container-image) from your Container Registry.

3. Select the required Container Registry namespace from the drop-down list, then select the container and tag.

4. Choose the [port](/serverless-containers/concepts/#port) your container is listening on. We recommend configuring your container to listen on the `$PORT` environment variable.

5. Choose a **name** for your container and, optionally, a **description**. The name must only contain alphanumeric characters and dashes.

### Container resources and scaling

1. Choose the **CPU** resources to be allocated to your container at runtime. 

2. Choose the amount of **memory** to be allocated to your container. Available memory options depend on allocated vCPU, and the maximum ephemeral storage value depends on allocated memory.
3. Set your [autoscaling](/serverless-containers/concepts/#autoscaling) preferences:
    - **Request concurrency**: your container automatically scales up/down within the minimum and maximum values entered based on the number of concurrent requests received on each active instance of your container.
    - **CPU percentage**: your container automatically scales up/down within the minimum and maximum values entered based on the CPU load.
    - **RAM percentage**: your container automatically scales up/down within the minimum and maximum values entered based on the RAM used.

### Container advanced options

In the **Advanced options** section, set the following:

<Tabs>
    <TabsTab label="Data">
    - Declare [environment variables](/serverless-containers/concepts/#environment-variables) you want to inject into your container. For each environment variable, click **+Add variable** and enter the key/value pair.
    - Declare [secrets](/serverless-containers/concepts/#secrets) for your container. Secrets are environment variables that are injected into your container, but the values are not retained or displayed by Scaleway after initial validation.
          <Message type="note">
          Encode your environment variables and secrets to `base64` if they are too large, and contain carriage returns.
          </Message>
    </TabsTab>
    <TabsTab label="Security">
      - Set the desired [privacy policy](/serverless-containers/concepts/#privacy-policy) for your container. This defines whether container invocation may be done anonymously (**public**) or only via an authentication mechanism provided by the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-containers/#authentication) (**private**).
      - Tick the box under **HTTPS connections only** to prevent your container from being called from insecure HTTP connections. All HTTP traffic will be redirected to HTTPS.
    </TabsTab>
    <TabsTab label="Requests">
    - Set a custom [timeout](/serverless-containers/concepts/#request-timeout) for the duration of the requests received by your container.
    - Tick the box under [HTTP protocol](/serverless-containers/concepts/#protocol) to listen to HTTP/2 requests if it is required by your application. Otherwise, we recommend you use HTTP/1.
    </TabsTab>
    <TabsTab label="Performances">
    - Select a [sandbox](/serverless-containers/concepts/#sandbox) version:
        - Sandbox v2 for shorter cold starts (recommended).
        - Sandbox v1 if you require full compatibility with the Linux system call interface (legacy).
    </TabsTab>
    <TabsTab label="Health checks">
      - Update the [health check](/serverless-containers/concepts/#health-check) behavior according to your needs:
        - **Probe type**: TCP, or HTTP
        - **Health checks intervals**: 5s - 120s (default: 30s)
        - **Failure threshold**: 3 - 50 (default: 10)
    </TabsTab>
    <TabsTab label="Storage">
    - Modify the [ephemeral storage](/serverless-containers/concepts/#ephemeral-storage) according to your needs.
    </TabsTab>
</Tabs>

### Container cost and validation

1. Update the **Number of requests** and **Average request duration** fields to simulate the behavior of your function.

2. Verify the **estimated cost**. Refer to the [Serverless Functions pricing](/serverless-functions/faq/#how-am-i-billed-for-serverless-functions) for more information on how billing works.

3. Click **Create function** to finish.

## Deploy from an external container registry

Scaleway Serverless Containers allows you to deploy containers from external public [container registries](/container-registry/concepts/#registry), such as Docker Hub, AWS container registries, GitLab container registry, etc.

Private external container registries are currently not supported.

</Message>

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The containers page displays.
2. Click the relevant container's namespace.
3. Click **Deploy container**. The container creation wizard displays.

### Container image configuration

1. Select the **External** Container Registry.

2. Enter the public container **image URL** provided by the external registry. For example:
      - `nginx:latest` to deploy the latest nginx image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
      - `ghcr.io/namespace/image` to deploy an image from [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/features/packages)
3. Choose the [port](/serverless-containers/concepts/#port) your container is listening on. We recommend configuring your container to listen on the `$PORT` environment variable.

4. Enter a **name** for your container, or use the automatically generated one.

5. Optionally, add a **description** and **tags**.

### Container resources and scaling
