Local testing allows you to run your code on your dev environment with really short deploy time.

Available frameworks :

- [Go](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-functions-go)
- [Python](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-functions-python)

# Local testing

Scaleway Serverless Functions can run outside Scaleway infrastructure, this is useful to setup,
develop and test functions locally. By running them directly on their machines, users can debug them, and analyse logs.

Each offline testing framework is written in the respective language, and emulates the calls made to functions by the Scaleway infrastructure. 
The result is a language-specific executable or script, that users can connect to with their favourite debugger and local tools.

## Requirements

Local testing your function will create a local web server that listens to a given port.

You will need to be able to install packages with the dependency manager of the runtime you use 
(ex: `pip`, `go get`...).

## Limitations

Each offline testing library does its best to replicate the Scaleway Functions environment, but cannot fully emulate the surrounding infrastructure. Therefore, although being able to run your function locally is a good indicator that it will work, it may still fail due to the execution environment used in Scaleway Serverless Functions.

The most significant difference is that when running in Scaleway Serverless Functions, we have packaged your function into a custom Docker image, built in our build pipeline, 
This means that at runtime, your function may be launched in a different operating system, with different libraries available to your local development environment.

Performance during local testing can differ from the deployed Serverless Functions environment, and will involve [limitations](/serverless/functions/reference-content/functions-limitations/) around resource usage and quotas.
and CPU/Memory settings does not apply to local testing functions.
