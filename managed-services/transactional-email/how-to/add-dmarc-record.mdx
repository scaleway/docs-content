This page shows you how to configure a basic [DMARC record](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#dmarc-record) on your domain.
If you have registered a domain at Scaleway Domains and DNS, you can still use this documentation, as the process is similar.
For more information about DMARC configuration and examples of DMARC records you can configure, refer to the [dedicated documentation](/managed-services/transactional-email/reference-content/dmarc-configuration/).

## Before you start

To complete the actions presented in this page, you must have:

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- A domain name
- [Configured your domain with Transactional Email](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/configure-domain-with-transactional-email).
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status of the Organization in which the actions will be performed, or be an IAM user with the [necessary permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission)

## How to configure a DMARC record

1. Add a `TXT` record type in the same zone as your Transactional Email's domain, on your DNS zone.
2. Enter `_dmarc` in the **Name** field, followed by the domain name. For example, if your domain is called `my-domain.com`, you should have `_dmarc.my-domain.com.` in the **Name** field.
3. Enter your desired tags and their values in the **Value** section. Make sure that you add the mandatory `v` and `p` tags, and that you separate tags from each other with semi-colons. Find out about DMARC configuration in our [dedicated documentation](/managed-services/transactional-email/reference-content/dmarc-configuration/).
    Your **Value** field should look similar to the following
    ```
    v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:your@email.com
    ```
    <Message type="important">
     It is possible to configure several DMARC records for one domain, but they must have a different name to be valid.
     For example, the `_dmarc.mydomain.com` and `_dmarc.tem.mydomain.com` DMARC records are valid.

6. Confirm the changes and add the DMARC record.

     If you have a domain at Scaleway Domains and DNS, you can access your account from the Scaleway [console](https://console.scaleway.com/), click **Domains and DNS** > **Your domain** > **DNS Zones**, then add a record in the same zone as your Transactional Email's domain.
