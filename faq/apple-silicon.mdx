## What is the minimum allocation period for an Apple Silicon Mac mini?
The minimum lease period for Apple Silicon-as-a-Service is 24 hours due to license constraints. A Mac mini can only be deleted after a minimum allocation period of 24 hours.

## How many public IP addresses can I assign to a Mac mini?
Each Mac mini can have one IPv4 address and one IPv6 subnet (`/128`).

## How can I reinstall my Mac mini?
To reinstall your Mac mini, navigate to the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/), then go to the **Apple Silicon** page. 
From there, select the server you wish to reinstall and locate the **Reinstall** button.
Click it, and you will be prompted to choose the macOS version for the reinstallation process.
Once selected, the reinstallation will commence automatically.

## How can I back up my Mac mini?
You can back up your Mac mini using a backup solution of your choice. Examples include:
- [Restic](/tutorials/restic-s3-backup/) for command-line backups.
- [Arq Backup](/tutorials/arqbackup-pc-mac/) for graphical interface backups.

Both solutions allow you to store backups on our [Object Storage](/storage/object/quickstart/).

## What is preinstalled on the Mac mini?
When you rent a Mac mini, it comes with a bare environment. The pre-installed tools include:
- The latest Xcode version compatible with the OS
- MacPorts for package management
- Fail2ban for VNC access filtering
- Our agent for SSH key application

## What operations are unsupported?
Certain operations are restricted by default MDM configuration profiles:
- You don't have access to the physical machine, thus no access to macOS recovery.
- Certain admin actions, like system Time Machine restoration and boot system policies, are not possible.

## Do I pay for my Mac mini when I am not using it?
Yes, you pay for your Mac mini as long as it is assigned to your account. You must explicitly delete it in the console or via the CLI to stop charges. For deletion instructions, see [How to delete Mac mini](/bare-metal/apple-silicon/how-to/delete-mac-mini/).
