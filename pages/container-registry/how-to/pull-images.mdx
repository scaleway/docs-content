import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'


After [configuring Docker on your local machine](/container-registry/how-to/connect-docker-cli/), you can use it to pull images from your Container Registry.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [Container Registry namespace](/container-registry/how-to/create-namespace/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your local computer
- Access to your [namespace](/container-registry/how-to/connect-docker-cli/)


1. Click **Container Registry** in the **Containers** section of the side menu. A list of your namespaces displays.
2. Click the namespace you want to pull an image from.
3. Click <Icon name="more" />, then **Pull instructions** next to the image you want to pull. A pop-up displays.
4. Copy the command line instructions to pull the image with Docker. Then click **OK** to close the pop-up.
5. Open a terminal window and paste the instructions into it to pull the image.
  <Message type="note">
    The current configuration allows you up to 20 pulls/min per image.
