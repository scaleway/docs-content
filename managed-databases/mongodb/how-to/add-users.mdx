Users can connect to a database and access its data. Each user has a different set of customizable permissions.

<Macro id="requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have a [MongoDB™ Database Instance](/managed-databases/mongodb/quickstart)
</Message>

1. Click **MongoDB™ Databases** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Go to the **Users** tab. A list of users displays. If it is the first time you are creating a user, your list will display the user you set up during the creation of your Database Instance.
4. Click <Icon name="plus" /> to create a new user.
5. Click <Icon name="toggle" /> to grant admin rights to the user.
    <Message type="note">
      Admin rights allow a user to create logical databases and users. These rights do not override the permissions configured for the logical databases. Logical database permissions must be set up in the permissions tab.
    </Message>
6. Enter the `username` and `password`.
    <Message type="note">
      Optionally, you can configure the appropriate permissions according to the user.
      Three types of permissions are available:
        - **None:** No access to the database
        - **Read:** Allow users to read tables and fields in a database
        - **Write:** Allow users to write content in databases
      You can select the permission type in the Permissions tab.
    </Message>
7. Click **Create a user** to confirm.

    Once the user is created, it is displayed in the user list.

To update the password, the permissions or delete the user, click <Icon name="more" /> to display the respective options.
