A hardware RAID is a type of [RAID](/dedibox/hardware/concepts/#raid) implementation where construction and management of the RAID is performed on dedicated hardware, independently of the operating system.

The logical disks of the RAID array are managed by a physical controller, sitting on the PCI bus, which presents only the logical volumes to the operating system. The RAID controller manages the RAID using its own CPU and RAM, without delegating tasks to the main CPU of the machine.
