Created by Upbound, [Crossplane](crossplane.io) is a Kubernetes-based platform that allows you to manage resources through a unified control plane. `crossplane-provider-scaleway` is a Crossplane provider adding support for your Scaleway Kubernetes resources. It is built using [Upjet](https://github.com/upbound/upjet) code generation tools and it exposes managed resources for Scaleway that adhere to Crossplane's eXtensible Resource Model (XRM). As a model, XRM ensures that users can easily and consistently manage cloud resources across different cloud providers.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to install Upbound Universal Crossplane (UXP) into your Kubernetes cluster, install the `Provider` and apply a `ProviderConfig` and create a managed resource using Scaleway's [Kubernetes](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/containers/kubernetes/concepts/)

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have created a [Kubernetes cluster](/en/docs/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/) and downloaded its [Kubeconfig file](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/containers/kubernetes/concepts#kubeconfig)
  - You have [created an API key](/en/docs/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key)
  - You have [installed curl](https://curl.se/download.html)
  - You have [installed `kubectl`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/install.md) on your local computer
</Message>

<Message type="note">
    All commands use the current `kubeconfig` context and configuration.
</Message>

## Installing the Up command-line

Run the following command to download and install the Upbound `up` command-line:

````
curl -sL "https://cli.upbound.io" | sh
sudo mv up /usr/local/bin/
````

<Message type="note">
    This tutorial uses `curl` but other command-line tools are available. You can refer to the [official dedicated documentation](https://docs.upbound.io/cli/#install-the-up-command-line) for more information.
</Message>

## Installing Upbound Universal Crossplane

Open a terminal and run the following `up uxp install` command to install [Upbound Universal Crossplane (UXP)](https://docs.upbound.io/uxp/):

````
up uxp install
UXP 1.9.0-up.3 installed
````

## Installing the provider into your Kubernetes cluster

1. Run the following command to create a `.kube` directory in which you will store your `kubeconfig` file: 

````
mkdir .kube
````

2. Run the following command to open the `config` file in your `.kube` directory. The file should be empty.

````
nano .kube/config
````

3. Paste the content of your Kubeconfig file and save the changes by following the information displayed on your terminal. Here is an example on a Mac Terminal screen.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-kubeconfig-terminal-screen.webp" alt="" />

4. Run the following command to install the provider into the Kubernetes cluster using the previously set Kubernetes configuration file.

````
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: provider-scaleway
spec:
  package: xpkg.upbound.io/scaleway/provider-scaleway:v0.1.0
EOF
````

You should get an output similar to this:

````
provider.pkg.crossplane.io/provider-scaleway Created
````

5. Run the following command to verify whether the provider has been properly installed.

````
kubectl get providers
````

You should get an output similar to this, with the value for `installed` returning `True`: 

````
NAME                INSTALLED   HEALTHY   PACKAGE                                             AGE
provider-scaleway   True        True   xpkg.upbound.io/scaleway/provider-scaleway:v0.1.0        11s
````

<Message type="note">
    The procedure may take up to 5 minutes for `HEALTHY` to report `True`.
</Message>

6. If the `INSTALLED` field is empty, it means the process of downloading and installing the provider has failed. Run `kubectl describe providers` to get more information.

## Creating a Kubernetes secret resource for Scaleway

The provider requires credentials to create and manage Scaleway resources.

1. Run the following command to create a `secret.yaml` file in which your Kubernetes secret configuration will be stored:

````
nano secret.yaml
````

2. Edit the request payload you will use to create your Kubernetes secret configuration file. Replace the parameters in the following example using the information in the Configuration reference table:

````
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: name-of-secret
  namespace: crossplane-system
type: Opaque
stringData:
  credentials: |
    {
      "access_key": "SCWXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
      "secret_key": "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
      "project_id": "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
      "region": "fr-par",
      "zone": "fr-par-1"
    }
````

3. Paste the content of the request payload and save the changes by following the information displayed on your terminal. 

4. Run the following command to create a `crossplane-system` [namespace](/en/docs/containers/container-registry/concepts/#namespace):

````
kubectl create namespace crossplane-system --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
````

You should get an output similar to this: 

````
namespace/crossplane-system created
````

| `access_key` | The first part of your [API key](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/api-keys). It is a like a unique ID or username and not a sensitive piece of information.                                           |
| `secret_key` | The second part of your [API key](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/api-keys). It is a unique ID or password and thus a sensitive piece of information to authenticate your Access Key.                |

## Creating a ProviderConfig file

Create a `.yaml` configuration file to attach your Scaleway credentials to the previously installed provider.

1. Run the following command to create a `ProviderConfig` file:

````
nano ProviderConfig
````

2. Edit the request payload you will use to create your ProviderConfig file. Replace the parameters in the following example using the information in the Configuration reference table:

````
apiVersion: scaleway.upbound.io/v1beta1
kind: ProviderConfig
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  credentials:
    source: Secret
    secretRef:
      name: name-of-secret
      namespace: crossplane-system
      key: credentials
````

3. Paste the content of the request payload and save the changes by following the information displayed on your terminal.

4. Run the following command to apply the previously set configuration to the secret. Make sure to replace the example file path with your own.

````
kubectl apply -f /users/FileName/ProviderConfig
````

You should get an output similar to this: 

````
providerconfig.scaleway.upbound.io/default created
````

5. Run the following command to verify whether the file's contents have been successfully applied to the Kubernetes cluster.

````
kubectl describe providerconfigs
````

You should get an output similar to this:

````

### Configuration reference 

| Parameter   | Description                                |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| `namespace` | The Kubernetes namespace the secret is in. |
| `name`      | The name of the Kubernetes secret object.  |

### Creating a managed resource

1. Run the following command to create a Scaleway Object Storage bucket: 

````
nano bucket.yaml
````
2. Paste the following example and save the changes by following the information displayed on your terminal:

````
apiVersion: object.scaleway.upbound.io/v1alpha1
kind: Bucket
metadata:
  name: object-bucket
spec:
  forProvider:
    name: crossplane-object-bucket
  providerConfigRef:
    name: default
````

You should get an output similar to this:

````
bucket.object.scaleway.upbound.io/object-bucket created
````

3. Run the following command to retrieve details on your newly created bucket:

````
kubectl get buckets 
````

You should get an output similar to this, with the values for `READY` and `SYNCED` returning `True`:

````
NAME                           READY   SYNCED   EXTERNAL-NAME                     AGE
object-bucket                  True    True     fr-par/crossplane-object-bucket   9s
````

### Deleting a managed resource

1. Run the following command to delete the bucket you just created:

````
kubectl delete -f bucket.yaml
````

You should get an output similar to this, confirming the bucket deletion:

````
bucket.object.scaleway.upbound.io "object-bucket" deleted
````

2. Run the following command to verify whether the bucket was properly deleted: 

````
kubectl get buckets
````

You should get an output similar to this:

````
No resources found
````
