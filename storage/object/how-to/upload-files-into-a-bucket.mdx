    <Message type="important">
      Do not close your web browser during an upload, as it might result in an incomplete upload. If you want to upload files bigger than 1 GB, we recommend [using the CLI](/storage/object/api-cli/object-operations/#putobject).
    </Message>
    When the upload is completed, a list of the objects displays, including the newly uploaded objects.
