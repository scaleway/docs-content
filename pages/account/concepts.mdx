## Abuse

[Abuse](https://www.scaleway.com/en/abuse-notice/) of Scaleway services includes cyber-crime, copyright violation, illegal or offensive content, spamming and malware distribution. Abuse can be [reported in the Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/support/abuses/create), even if you do not have a Scaleway account. It is also possible to report abuse via email. Refer to the [Scaleway Trust and Safety](https://www.scaleway.com/en/contact-trust-and-safety/) page for more information.

Multiple instances of abuse from the same offending resource for the same reason within a given time frame are grouped by case. An abuse report either creates a case if no case is currently open or joins an existing case. Scaleway clients are responsible for taking the appropriate security measures to solve the case and related abuse reports.

## Active session

An active session begins when a computer or device signs into your account. To connect you to your account, Scaleway uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT). JWT allows secure transmission of information between parties through tokens. These parties can be users, servers, or any other combination of services. In the case of Scaleway, when a user connects to their account (e.g. via an email address and password), we generate a token, associate it with the session and send it to the user. The token is composed of a header, a payload, and a signature. You can see the list of your active sessions in the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/settings/account/security), to get an overview of all devices that are signed in and recently active on your account.

## Authentication code

An authentication code provides quick and secure access to your account without the hassle of remembering your [password](#login-information). When you choose to sign in with an authentication code, you receive a unique code sent directly to your email inbox that you can use one time only to [authenticate your login](/account/how-to/log-in-to-the-console/#how-to-log-in-with-an-authentication-code).

## Console

The Scaleway console allows you to view and manage your Scaleway products, billing information, support tickets, and more. [Access the Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/organization).

## KYC

**K**now **Y**our **C**ustomer is the process of verifying a client's identity. An ID document such as a passport, driver's license, or identity card is required to [complete KYC verification](/account/how-to/verify-identity/).

## Login information

Consists of the **e-mail address** your account is registered to and its corresponding [**password**](#password). With your login information, you can connect to your Scaleway Organization via the Scaleway console. As an alternative to using a password, you can login using an [authentication code](#authentication-code).

## MAC Address

A **M**edia **A**ccess **C**ontrol Address is a unique ID assigned to network interface cards (NICs), used to ensure the physical address of a computer. It identifies the hardware manufacturer and is used for network communication between devices in a network segment.

## Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

Multifactor authentication (MFA) is any form of verification that requires two factors to authenticate to a device you wish to connect to. Scaleway supports MFA for Cloud accounts in the form of a security code that you use in addition to your [password](#password) when you log in. You can receive the code via SMS or an authenticator app on your smartphone. Enabling MFA adds an additional layer of security against unauthorized access to your account.

Refer to the [How to use MFA](/account/how-to/use-2fa) documentation page for more information.

## Password

A password is a string of characters associated with your account's email address that allows you to access the [Scaleway console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements). It is personal and must not be shared with anyone. Alternatively, you can use an [authentication code](#authentication-code) to authenticate yourself.

## Single Sign-on (SSO)

Single Sign-On (SSO) allows you to use your Google, Microsoft, or Github account to log in to the console. To do so, make sure the email address associated with your Scaleway account matches the email address of your Google, Microsoft, or Github account.

## Support plan

Scaleway provides four different types of [support plans](https://console.scaleway.com/support/plans): Basic, Advanced, Business and Enterprise. Your support plan determines the level of service and dedicated assistance you have access to, and the guaranteed response time of your support requests. You can [configure your support plan in the console](/account/how-to/configure-support-plans/).

Refer to the [Understanding support plans](/account/reference-content/understanding-support-plans) reference page for more details about how each plan works.

## Username

A Username is an identifier set by an Organization administrator for [IAM Members](/iam/concepts/#member).

To log in to the Scaleway console, the Members of an Organization need to provide the Organization ID, username, and password (optional). These identifiers must be communicated to the Members by their Organization admins.

Refer to the [How to manage Members](/iam/how-to/manage-members) documentation page for more information.

## UUID

A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) is a 128-bit label attributed by Scaleway to each resource, used to identify them in CLI and API operations. UUIDs can also identify users and Organizations, as well as cloud resources.
