Before you can order Scaleway resources, you must add your payment method to your account.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

1. Click **Billing** in the Organization drop-down menu to go to the **Billing Overview** page.
 <Message type="tip">
      Alternatively, you can reach the [billing page](https://console.scaleway.com/organization/billing) from your [Organization Dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) by clicking **Go to Billing** above the **Current consumption** area.
    </Message>
2. Click **Payment and billing**.
3. Scroll down to **Payment Methods**.

You can choose between two payment methods: **credit card** or **SEPA mandate.**

### How to add a credit card

1. Enter the details of your credit or debit card.
2. Click **Add credit card** to confirm. A [3D Secure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-D_Secure) validation is initiated. Depending on your bank, you may be asked to enter a code received by SMS or via an application on your smartphone.
3. Enter the code and validate the form.
    <Message type="note">
     When you register a new credit card, an authorization charge of **1€** is debited from your account. This **Authorization Charge** is a dummy transaction made to check the validity of the card and will carry a 4-digit validation code, displayed on your bank account statement. The authorization charge will be reimbursed within 48 to 72 hours.

4. Click **Verify**. A pop-up appears.
5. Enter the 4-digit validation code displayed on your bank account statement.
    <Message type="note">
      Bank account statements have different displays depending on the bank, but the validation code can always be found in the description of your transactions. The image below provides an example of how the validation code might appear in your bank statement:

  You have up to 10 days to enter your validation code in the console.
