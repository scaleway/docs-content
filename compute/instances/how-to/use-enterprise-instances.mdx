This page gathers information about the creation, management and specificities of Scaleway Enterprise Instances. [Enterprise Instances](/compute/instances/concepts#enterprise-instance) are high-end Instances based on the AMD EPYC™ 7003 Series Processor. 

Enterprise Instances come without local storage and you can add one or several Block Storage volumes depending on your requirements. The minimum size of a Block Storage volume is 10GB.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)

## How to create an Enterprise Instance

Follow the instructions for [creating an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance), ensuring you conform to the following:
- Select your **Availability Zone**. 
- Choose an **Image** to run on your Instance. This can be an operating system or a custom image. A complete list of all available Linux distributions can be found [here](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/).
- Select an **Enterprise** Instance as your Instance type 
- When configuring your **Block Storage** volumes, bear in mind the following:
  - You can attach one or several volumes to your Instance, depending on your requirements.
  - The minimum size for a Block Storage volume is 10 GB.
  - If several Block Storage volumes are connected to an Enterprise Instance, the first volume will contain the OS and is required to boot the Instance. You can [change your boot volume](/compute/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes/#how-to-change-the-boot-volume) after you create the Instance.

<Message type="important">

If you have two or more volumes with identical operating systems, or a volume with no operating system, choosing one of these as your boot volume may cause unpredictable boot behavior.

<Message type="note">

When choosing an image for your Enterprise Instance, be aware this Instance type is not compatible with Bootscripts, except for [Rescue Mode](/compute/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes#how-to-use-rescue-mode)

## How to connect to an Enterprise Instance

Follow the instructions for [connecting to an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance).

## How to back up an Enterprise Instance

Follow the instructions for [backing up data with snapshots](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/backup-your-data-with-snapshots/).

<Message type="note">

Snapshots created from a local volume `(l_ssd)` cannot be used to create an Enterprise Instance, as it only supports booting from block volume `(b_ssd)`.

## How to use Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV)

Enterprise Instances rely on the AMD EPYC™ 7003 series Processor, which provides the SEV feature. AMD SEV helps keep your Instance's data confidential, by encrypting the memory of the virtual machine. SEV does not require any changes to your application software, it is enabled in the hypervisor and in the image of the Enterprise Instance. More details on the SEV feature are available at the [AMD website](https://developer.amd.com/sev/).

You can check that SEV is activated on your Enterprise Instance by entering the following into its command line:

```
# dmesg | grep -i sev
```
<Message type="note">

- As the encryption is activated at the boot of the Instance, the boot time can take a few seconds more on larger Enterprise Instances.
- If the Instance is booted into Rescue Mode, SEV is disabled automatically.
