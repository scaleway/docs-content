\* Lower limits may apply before account verification. [Contact our support team](https://console.scaleway.com/support) if you have any questions.

\** Total function memory is the sum of the memory allocated to all your functions at their maximum Scale.

\*** Use [Serverless Jobs](/serverless/jobs/) for longer tasks.

These limits are enforced as [Organization quotas](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/additional-content/organization-quotas/#serverless-functions).

If the limits are exceeded during the execution of the function, a restart occurs.

## Configuration restrictions

To ensure the proper functioning of the product, we restrict the use of certain ports and environment variables.

* Blocked ports:
  * **25**: Due to potential abuse (spam), no outbound traffic is allowed through this port, except from Scaleway Transactional Email SMTP servers.
  * **465**: Due to potential abuse (spam), no outbound traffic is allowed through this port, except from Scaleway Transactional Email SMTP servers.
* Reserved environment variables:
  * `SCW_*`: Reserved for product configuration (for example: token validation).

## Versioning and rollback

Scaleway Functions do not currently support versioning or automatic rollback mechanisms.
However, in the event of a failed deployment, the previously deployed version of the function will continue to handle
incoming requests for up to 24 hours. After this period, the function in error will be deleted, and requests will no
longer be served until a successful deployment is made. This ensures temporary service continuity, but it is important
to monitor and resolve deployment issues promptly, as the fallback is not intended to provide long-term version control
or rollback capabilities.

Below is an example than illustrates this behavior:

* Time +0H: The first function is deployed and works correctly.
* Time +1H: The function is redeployed, but the deployment fails, and the function ends up in an error state.
* Time +2H: Despite the failed deployment, the first function is still handling incoming requests.
* Time +25H: The 24-hour window expires, and both the first working function and the failed function are removed,
leading to service disruption until a new successful deployment is made.
