The LEMP-Stack references a group of software that can be used to serve dynamic web applications and websites. **LEMP** is an acronym and stands for:

- A Linux operating system
- A [Nginx](http://nginx.org/) (pronounced as _Engine-X_) web server
- A [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) (or [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/), which is a drop-in fork of MySQL) database server
- [PHP](http://www.php.net/) for dynamic data processing

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your SSH key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
  - You have a [Scaleway Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) running on Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) or later
  - You have a FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) pointing to your Instance's IP address
  - You have `sudo` privileges or access to the root user
</Message>

## Installing the stack

1. [Connect to your Instance via SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/).
2. Use the `apt` package manager of Ubuntu to install the required packages. Make sure that the system is up-to-date and has the latest bug-fixes and updates installed by running the following command:
    ```bash
    apt update && apt -y upgrade
    ```
3. Install the software stack:
    ```bash
    apt install -y ufw nginx mariadb-server php-fpm php-mysql
    ```

## Configuring the firewall

1. Enable HTTP and SSH connections in the [firewall](/tutorials/installation-uncomplicated-firewall/) configuration of the server by running the following command:
    ```bash
    ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
    ufw allow 'OpenSSH'
    ```
2. Enable ufw:
    ```bash
    ufw enable
    ```

    You are asked if you want to proceed. Confirm the activation of the firewall by typing `y`:

    ```bash
    Command may disrupt existing ssh connections. Proceed with operation (y|n)? y
    Firewall is active and enabled on system startup
    ```
3. Check the status of ufw:
    ```bash
    ufw status
    ```
  
    It will return a list of the allowed services:

    ```bash
    Status: active

    To                         Action      From
    --                         ------      ----
    Nginx HTTP                 ALLOW       Anywhere
    OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
    Nginx HTTP (v6)            ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
    OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
    ```

## Configuring MySQL/MariaDB

1. Launch the configuration assistant for the database server:
    ```bash
    mysql_secure_installation
    ```
2. Press "Enter" when prompted for the current root password for the MariaDB server, as the password is not yet set.
3. Press `Y` to enter a new password for the MariaDB root user:
    ```bash
    Setting the root password ensures that nobody can log into the MariaDB
    root user without the proper authorization.

    Set root password? [Y/n]
    ```
4. Enter the new password and press `Enter`, then repeat this step.
5. Keep the settings proposed by default when prompted by further questions, by pressing `Enter` each time.

## Configuring a Nginx server block

Nginx stores the configuration of virtual hosts in server blocks. All available server blocks are located in the directory `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`.

1. Navigate to the relevant directory:
    ```
    cd /etc/nginx/sites-available/
    ```
2. Create a new server block configuration file and name it after the domain name that points to your Instance. Here we use `example.com`:
    ```
      server {
            listen 80;
            root /var/www/html;
            index index.php index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;
            server_name example.com;

            location / {
                    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
            }

            location ~ \.php$ {
                    include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
                    fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.2-fpm.sock;
            }

            location ~ /\.ht {
                    deny all;
            }
    }
    ```

    Remember to replace `example.com` and any other information necessary as per the overview below:

    Overview:
      - `listen` — Defines the port Nginx will listen on. Here, it listens on port 80, the default port for HTTP.
      - `root` — Specifies the document root where all files of the website are stored.
      - `index` — Gives priority to files named _index.php_, when an index file is requested.
      - `server_name` — The domain name relating to this server block.
      - `location /` — This location block checks the existence of a requested file. It will deliver either the file or return a 404 error.
      - `location ~ \.php$` — The second location block handles the PHP processing by pointing Nginx to the fastcgi-php.conf configuration file and the php7.2-fpm.sock file, which declares what socket is associated with php-fpm.
      - `location ~ /\.ht` — The last location block prevents .htaccess files to be processed by Nginx. Any .htaccess located in the directory root won't be served to visitors.
3. Save and exit the file.
4. Create a symbolic link to enable the server block. Replace `example.com` with your domain.
    ```bash
    ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
    ```
5. Test the configuration for syntax errors.
    ```bash
    nginx -t
    ```
6. Reload the Nginx configuration.
    ```bash
    systemctl reload nginx.service
    ```

## Testing PHP

1. Create a test PHP file to test if your LEMP stack is working.
    ```bash
    nano /var/www/html/phpinfo.php
    ```
2. Put the following content in it:
    ```php
    <?php
    phpinfo();
    ?>
    ```
3. Save the file and point your web browser to `http://example.com/phpinfo.php` (replacing `example.com` with your domain name). When you see an output like the following, it means PHP is set up correctly:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-lemp-php72.webp" alt="" />

## Configuring SSL with Let's Encrypt

By default, the connection between your computer and the server is not encrypted and it is possible to read the communication. To secure the connection you can generate an SSL certificate for free, issued by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org).

Let's Encrypt provides a [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) to configure Nginx automatically with Let's Encrypt.

1. Prepare the system.
    ```bash
    apt update && apt -y install software-properties-common
    add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
    apt update
    ```

    You may be warned that the PPA has been deprecated. You can press [ENTER] to continue adding it nonetheless.
2. Install certbot.
    ```bash
    apt install python3-certbot-nginx
    ```
3. Run certbot.
    ```bash
    certbot --nginx
    ```
4. Answer the prompts.
    ```
