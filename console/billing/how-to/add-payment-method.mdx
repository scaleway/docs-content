- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

     When you register a new credit card, an authorization charge of **â‚¬1** is debited from your account. This **Authorization Charge** is a dummy transaction made to check the validity of the card and will carry a 4-digit validation code, displayed on your bank account statement. The authorization charge will be reimbursed within 48 to 72 hours.
