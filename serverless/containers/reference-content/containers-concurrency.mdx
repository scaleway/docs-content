## Concurrency overview

Concurrency determines the number of incoming requests a single instance of a container can process before scaling up. Serverless Containers autoscale according to the number of instances needed to handle the incoming workload. 

A higher number of instances processing requests at the same time implies a greater usage of memory and [vCPU](/serverless/containers/concepts/#vcpu), and consequently a higher cost.



## Maximum concurrent requests per instance

When [deploying a container](/serverless/containers/how-to/deploy-a-container-from-scaleway-container-registry/), Scaleway Serverless Containers allows you to edit the **Maximum concurrent requests per instance** parameter.

Serverless Containers apply the highest possible value by default: **80 concurrent requests**. We recommend using the default value, as Serverless Containers are designed to efficiently function with it, but you can lower it to better fit specific requirements.

## Examples

If your Serverless Container hosts a resource-intensive application that can only handle a small number of requests with the provisioned memory and vCPU, you can reduce the number of maximum concurrent requests per instance to scale quicker and avoid bottlenecks and queued requests.

You can set the **Maximum concurrent requests per instance** of your container to `1` if it is designed to handle a single request at a time. However, a low maximum concurrency value may affect the performance of your deployment, as several instances of your container will start if it receives a high number of concurrent requests.
