The [webmail](https://webmail.online.net/) used at Scaleway to read your emails, offers options to encrypt your mails with PGP, helping to ensure:

- Confidentiality of emails
- That the sender is who they claim to be

<Message type="note">
  Keep in mind that PGP encryption of your email includes a non-repudiation character, this means once the email is sent and received, you can not say “it was not me, who sent it”.

The [Scaleway webmail interface](https://webmail.online.net) currently offers one way of encrypting your emails: `Mailvelope`. 

## How to configure Mailvelope

`Mailvelope` works on the client side and requires you to install an extension in your browser: 

* [Extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mailvelope/kajibbejlbohfaggdiogboambcijhkke).
* [Extension for Firefox](https://download.mailvelope.com/releases/latest/mailvelope.firefox.xpi).

1. Install the `Mailvelope` extension depending on the browser you use.
2. Once the extension is installed, click **Options**. 
3. **Generate** or **import** an already existing key.You can keep the advanced parameters in their default values.

4. Once generated or imported, the key appears in the list of available keys in the extension.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_once_generated.webp" alt="" />
5. Enter your Scaleway webmail interface and click **the logo of the extension**, then click **Add**.

## How to write a PGP signed or encrypted email 

1. Once you have configured the extension, go back to your webmail and open the interface for writing new emails.
2. Click the **icon of the extension** to write an email with PGP. A pop-up displays.
3. Write your email and when you are done, click **sign** or **encrypt** the email. 
4. Enter your key password: 
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_key_password.webp" alt="" />
5. Click **OK**.

## How to encrypt and sign an email 

1. Choose your identity in the drop-down box. 
2. Choose the addressee of your email to be able to encrypt it with their public key. 
    <Message type="note">
    To sign an email, you have to choose your identity in both the drop-down box and the **Encrypt for**
    section.

    </Message>

## How to send an email

1. Once you have been redirected after encrypting and/or signing, you email will appear in its final form in the window of the extension displaying: 
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_send_email.webp" alt="" />
2. Click **Transfer** to transfer your email into your webmail's interface. 
3. Once transferred, you can send the email from your interface.
