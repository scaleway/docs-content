Scaleway’s [Bare Metal Cloud Servers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/bare-metal-servers/) provide you with dedicated servers on-demand, with all the benefits of the cloud including flexibility and hourly billing. These servers are great for large workloads, big data and (because no-one else is sharing your server) applications that require increased security and dedicated resources.

You can create and manage your Bare Metal servers from the console, via the API or via the Scaleway Command Line Interface.

## Scaleway Command Line Interface Overview

[The Scaleway Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli) allows you to pilot your Scaleway infrastructure directly from your terminal, providing a faster way to administer and monitor your resources. Scaleway CLI is easy to set up and use, and an essential tool for operating efficiently in your cloud environment. The CLI provides many functionalities, including the ability to create and administer Bare Metal Servers.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) 
- You have [configured your SSH Key](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- You have [generated your API key](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key/)
- You have [downloaded and installed the Scaleway CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli)

</Message>

## Configuring the CLI

1. Open a terminal and type the following command to configure the Scaleway CLI on your machine:

  ```
  scw init
  ```

  If you have already configured the CLI, you will see a message like the following:

  ```
  Current config is located at /path/to/config.yaml
  access_key: <YOUR ACCESS KEY>
  secret_key: <YOUR SECRET KEY>
  default_organization_id: <YOUR ORGANIZATION ID>
  default_project_id: <YOUR PROJECT ID>
  default_region: <YOUR DEFAULT REGION, eg fr-par>
  default_zone: <YOUR DEFAULT ZONE, eg fr-par-1>

  Do you want to override the current config? (Y/n):  
  ```

2. Type `n` and go directly to the [Creating a Bare Metal Server](#creating-a-bare-metal-server) step of this tutorial if you do not want to edit your configuration.

  If you have not yet configured the CLI, you will be guided through the configuration process via a series of questions:

  ```
  Enter a valid secret-key or an email
  ```

3. Enter either the email address for your account (you will then be asked for your password), or your [API Secret Key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key)

  ```
  To improve this tool we rely on diagnostic and usage data.
  Sending such data is optional and can be disabled at any time by running "scw config set send-telemetry=false".
  Do you want to send usage statistics and diagnostics? (Y/n):
  ```

 Type `y` or `n`.

  ```
  To fully enjoy Scaleway CLI we recommend you install autocomplete support in your shell.
  Do you want to install autocomplete? (Y/n):
  ```

 Type `y` or `n`.

  ```
  To enable autocomplete, scw needs to update your shell configuration.
  What type of shell are you using (default: zsh):
  ```

4. Enter if the default shell type is the one you are using. Otherwise, enter the correct shell type you are using. This should complete the configuration process:

  ```
  Initialization completed with success.
  ```

## Creating a Bare Metal Server


<Message type="important">

- Bare Metal servers are only available in the `fr-par-2` zone at the moment. 
- The available server types are the following: `GP-BM1-L` `GP-BM1-M` `GP-BM1-S` `HC-BM1-L` `HC-BM1-S` `HM-BM1-XL` `HM-BM1-M`.

</Message>


1. Type the following command in your terminal to create your Bare Metal Server:

    `scw baremetal server create name=name-of-your-server type=GP-BM1-L zone=fr-par-2`


    An output similar to the following displays: 

    ```
    ID              12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789123
    OrganizationID  12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789123
    ProjectID       12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789123
    Name            name-of-your-server
    Description     -

    BootType        normal
    Zone            fr-par-2
    PingStatus      unknown
    ```

    <Message type="note">

   * For more information on creating a Bare Metal server, type `scw baremetal server create --help` in your terminal.
   * You can type additional information such as `description` to add a description of your Bare Metal server, or `tags.0` to add tags.

    </Message>


2. 


  

  You should see output in the console showing the API request and response, and finally confirming the ID and details of your server:

  ```
  ID              <ID of the Bare Metal Server>
  OrganizationID  <Your Organization ID>
  ProjectID       <Your Project ID>
  Name            bm-tutorial-server
  Description     -
  UpdatedAt       now
  CreatedAt       now
  Status          delivering
  OfferID         <Offer ID>
  Tags.0          -
  Domain          -
  BootType        normal
  Zone            fr-par-2
  PingStatus      unknown
  ```

3. Note down the ID of your Bare Metal server, as you will need it in the next step.

  <Message type="note">
  
  You can view a summary of information for your Bare Metal server, and details for any other Bare Metal servers you have previously created, by typing `scw baremetal server list zone=fr-par-2`. For full information, use the command `scw baremetal server get <Server ID> zone=fr-par-2`

  </Message>

## Installing an OS

Now that you have created your Bare Metal server, the next thing you will probably want to do is install an OS.

1. To see a list of available OSes, type:

  ```
  scw baremetal os list zone=fr-par-2
  ```

  You will see an output with available OSes and their associated IDs:

  ```
  ID                                    NAME    VERSION
  03b7f4ba-a6a1-4305-984e-b54fafbf1681  Ubuntu  20.04
  60f5d1e3-fa69-45af-9fc0-c9e3c114dd09  Ubuntu  19.10
  86fd5e3a-b023-4fa8-a3ae-1a194d8cd68c  CentOS  8
  f2aeab5d-6015-4b7c-b4ed-d76e89093621  Debian  10
  eef03f45-057b-4192-b95f-c21cae01e959  Debian  9
  d17d6872-0412-45d9-a198-af82c34d3c5c  CentOS  7.6
  d859aa89-8b4a-4551-af42-ff7c0c27260a  Ubuntu  18.04
  3ea52186-1e57-499e-8146-ab38051a5c10  Ubuntu  BigBlueButton 16.04
  ```

2. Note down the ID of you the OS you want to install.

3. To install your chosen OS on your Bare Metal server, you will also need to know the SSH Key ID associated with your account. Type:

  ```
  scw account ssh-key list
  ```

  You will see an output like:

  ```
  ID                 NAME                    CREATED AT  UPDATED AT  PROJECT ID
  <YOUR SSH KEY ID>  <NAME OF YOUR SSH KEY>  1 week ago  1 week ago  <YOUR PROJECT ID>         
  ```

4. Note down your SSH Key ID.

5. Now that you have the ID of the OS you want to install and the ID of your SSH Key, you can install an OS on your Bare Metal server with the following command. Remember to replace the values of the arguments with the correct values for your IDs. Note that the `hostname` does not have to be the same as the Server Name you chose in step 2.2.

  ```
  scw baremetal server install <Bare Metal Server ID> os-id=<OS ID> hostname=<Hostname for the Server> ssh-key-ids.0=<SSH Key ID> zone=fr-par-2
  ```

  >Note: If you have multiple SSH keys, you can use the argument `all-ssh-keys=true` to install all your SSH keys on the server

  You should see an output similar to the following, which confirms that the OS is being installed:

  ```
  ID                          <ID of the Bare Metal Server>
  OrganizationID              <Your Organization ID>
  ProjectID                   <Your Project ID>
  Name                        bm-tutorial-server
  Description                 -
  UpdatedAt                   8 minutes ago
  CreatedAt                   11 minutes ago
  Status                      ready
  OfferID                     <Offer ID>
  Tags.0                      -
  IPs.0.ID                    <IPs.0.ID >
  IPs.0.Address               <IPs.0.Address>
  IPs.0.Reverse               <IPs.0.Reverse>
  IPs.0.Version               IPv4
  IPs.0.ReverseStatus         active
  IPs.0.ReverseStatusMessage  -
  IPs.1.ID                    <IPs.1.ID >
  IPs.1.Address               <IPs.1.Address>
  IPs.1.Reverse               <IPs.1.Reverse>
  IPs.1.Version               IPv6
  IPs.1.ReverseStatus         active
  IPs.1.ReverseStatusMessage  -
  Domain                      <domain>.fr-par-2.baremetal.scw.cloud
  BootType                    normal
  Zone                        fr-par-2
  Install.OsID                <OS ID>
  Install.Hostname            <Server Hostname>
  Install.SSHKeyIDs.0         2d93ac50-1a57-4476-b686-16b514a35931
  Install.Status              to_install
  PingStatus                  down
  ```

  Installation of the OS should take less than one hour. You can use the `scw baremetal server list zone=fr-par-2` command again if you wish, to check whether the status of your server has moved from `Installing` to `Ready`.

## Using other CLI commands

There are many other functionalities you can access for your Bare Metal Server via the Scaleway CLI. In the following examples, replace the Bare Metal Server ID with the ID of your Bare Metal server:

<Message type="note">

Before powering off your Bare Metal server, you should [log into your server as root](/compute/bare-metal-cloud/how-to/connect-to-server) and execute the `halt` command to shutdown the OS. If you're not sure of the IP address of your Bare Metal server, for login purposes, use the `scw baremetal server get <Server-ID/> zone=fr-par-2` command to see this information in the `IPs.0.Address` field

</Message>

-**To power off** your Bare Metal Server, use the following command:

  ```
  scw baremetal server stop <Bare Metal Server ID> zone=fr-par-2
  ```

-**To power on** your Bare Metal Server, use the following command:

  ```
  scw baremetal server start <Bare Metal Server ID> zone=fr-par-2
  ```

-**To reboot** your Bare Metal Server, use the following command:

  ```
  scw baremetal server reboot <Bare Metal Server ID> zone=fr-par-2
  ```

  For further information, execute the `help` command:

  ```
  scw baremetal server --help
  ```

## Deleting your Bare Metal Server

<Message type="note">

This will permanently delete your Bare Metal server and all your data will be lost. This action is irreversible.

</Message>

When you want to remove your Bare Metal server, at the end of its lifecycle, you can delete it with the following command.

```
scw baremetal server reboot <Bare Metal Server ID> zone=fr-par-2
```

You will see an output like the following:

```

Install.Status              completed
PingStatus                  down
```

Note that the `status` field now says `deleting`. The deletion process may take a few minutes. You can check that your Bare Metal server has been deleted by verifying that it is not returned when you enter the command:

```
scw baremetal server list zone=fr-par-2
```

## Conclusion and going further

You now know how to create a Bare Metal server via the Scaleway CLI, as well as install an OS, power the server off and on, reboot it, and delete it. You can use the `--help` command as described with the Scaleway CLI to find more information about its different functionalities and parameters. More information about the Scaleway CLI is available in the [GitHub documentation](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/tree/master/docs/commands).
