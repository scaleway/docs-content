**S**erver-**S**ide **E**ncryption with **O**bject **N**ative **E**ncryption (SSE-ONE) is an encryption method provided by Scaleway Object Storage to protect your data at rest. It allows you to encrypt data when it is uploaded, and to decrypt data when accessed, with Scaleway managing encryption keys (AES-256).

By default, SSE-ONE is applied per-upload, meaning that you must specify the encryption parameter for each PutObject operation. However, you can enable SSE-ONE on a bucket, so that each object uploaded is automatically encrypted at rest with an individual encryption key. Scaleway manages the creation, lifecycle, and deletion of encryption keys.

Scaleway SSE-ONE behaves similarly to Server Side Encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).

Scaleway also supports SSE-C. Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/object-storage/api-cli/enable-sse-c/) for more information.
