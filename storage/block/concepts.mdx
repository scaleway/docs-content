## Block device

A block device is a storage volume on a network-connected storage system that is exposed to the guest operating system as if it were a physical disk.

## Local volume

The local volume of an Instance is an all SSD-based storage solution, using a RAID array for redundancy and performance, that is hosted on the local hypervisor.

## Storage Area Networks (SANs)

A Storage Area Network (SAN) consists of interconnected machines, network infrastructure and storage devices designed for performance and high-availability. Unlike a Network Attached Storage (NAS) which stores all data on a [file level](https://www.scaleway.com/en/blog/understanding-the-different-types-of-storage/#what-is-file-storage), the SAN stores all data on [block level](https://www.scaleway.com/en/blog/understanding-the-different-types-of-storage/#what-is-block-storage), this makes SAN a perfect solution for business critical applications and input/output intense operations like relational databases. The SAN is a network-connected solution, that operates independently from the local hypervisor hosting the virtual Instance. The storage capacity of the block devices on the SAN can be tailored towards your requirements.

## Volumes

A storage space used by your Instances. Several volumes can be [attached to an Instance](/storage/block/how-to/attach-a-volume/). In addition, they can be [snapshotted](/compute/instances/how-to/create-a-snapshot/), [mounted](/storage/block/how-to/mount-and-use-volume/) or [unmounted](/storage/block/how-to/unmount-a-volume/).
