Failover IP addresses allow you to have several IPs on the server and thus, for example, to have one IP for each website or for each virtual machine.

Your failover IP can be routed at any time to your servers in just a few minutes by using the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net) or through the [Dedibox API](https://console.online.net/en/api/). By switching your failover IP addresses from one server to another, the hosted services remain available without reconfiguring the IP address.

For each server, you can add failover IP addresses according to the offer and your service level.

<Requirements />

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- [Created](/dedibox/how-to/order-a-server/) a Dedibox dedicated server

<FailoverIp />

1. Click **Server** in your Dedibox console to display a list of your dedicated servers. Then click on the server you want to configure.
2. On the server's status page, click **Failover** in the menu on the left.
3. The list of your existing failover IPs displays. Drag and drop your failover IP from the list on the left on the ID of the server you want to use as destination host.
4. Click **Update** once you finish the failover IP destination configuration.

    The failover IP will be routed to the new destination host within a few minutes.
