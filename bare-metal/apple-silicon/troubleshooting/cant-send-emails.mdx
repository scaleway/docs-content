<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created a Mac mini](/bare-metal/apple-silicon/how-to/create-mac-mini/)
</Message>

For security reasons the SMTP ports on Apple silicon machines are blocked. It is therefore not possible to send emails from your Mac mini.
