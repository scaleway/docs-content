## Let's Encrypt Overview

[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is a certificate authority providing free SSL certificates. The creation, validation, installation is automated with certbot — all major browsers trust certificates issued by Let's Encrypt.

In this tutorial you will learn how to create a website for Apache to serve, then secure the Apache web server on Ubuntu Bionic Beaver with a Let's Encrypt certificate using certbot.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/)
  - You have a domain name pointing towards your Instance's IP address (via an A or AAAA record)
  - You have [configured your SSH key](/console/project/how-to/create-ssh-key)
  - You have sudo privileges or access to the root user.

## Installing Apache

1. [Connect to your Instance via SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/), and update the software already installed:
    ```
    apt update
    apt upgrade -y
    ```
2. Install the Apache web server:
    ```
    apt install apache2
    ```
3. Create a directory for the website. In this tutorial we use `myweb.example.com`. Replace it with your domain name whenever you see it:
    ```
    mkdir -p /var/www/html/myweb.example.com/public_html
    ```
4. Create an index page for the website by running the following command:
    ```
    nano /var/www/html/myweb.example.com/public_html/index.html
    ```

    Then copy the following content into the file, save it and exit nano:

    ```
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>myweb.example.com</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>New Website</h1>
        <p>This is the new website of myweb.exaple.com</p>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```
5. Create a configuration file for the website, by making a copy of the default configuration:
    ```
    cp /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/myweb.example.com.conf
    ```
6. Open the file in a text editor:
    ```
    nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/myweb.example.com.conf
    ```
    E
    dit the following lines to match your configuration, add them to the file, save it and exit the editor:

    ```
    ServerAdmin webmaster@myweb.example.com
    ServerName myweb.example.com
    ServerAlias www.myweb.example.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/myweb.example.com/public_html
    ```

    Once edited the file should look like this example:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-config_apache.webp" alt="" />
7. Activate the new site:
    ```
    a2ensite myweb.example.com
    ```
8. Reload the Apache configuration to enable the new site:
    ```
    systemctl reload apache2.service
    ```

## Installing Certbot

Install Certbot via apt:
```
apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache -y
```

## Running Certbot

1. Run Certbot to request a certificate for the domain name:
    ```
    certbot --apache
    ```

    Certbot will ask you a series of questions:

    - Firstly, Certbot asks for your email address. Enter it and press `Enter` on your keyboard.
    - You will then be asked to agree to the terms of service. Do so by pressing `Y`.
    - Decide if you want to share your email address with the [Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)](https://www.eff.org/). Press `Y` for yes or `N` for no.
    - Next, you will be asked for which domains you want to activate SSL. Select the appropriate numbers separated by commas and/or spaces, or leave input blank to select all options shown.
    - Certbot asks if all traffic should be forced to HTTPS. Type `1` for no or `2` for yes.
    - The certificate is requested and the following message appears once it has been obtained:
      ```
      Congratulations! You have successfully enabled https://myweb.example.com

      You should test your configuration at:
      https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=myweb.example.com
      ```
2. Verify the certificate by opening your site in a web browser:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-ssl_enabled.webp" alt="" />

The small padlock icon indicates that the connection to your Instance is now encrypted.
