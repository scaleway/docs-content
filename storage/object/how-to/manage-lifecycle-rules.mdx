With the Scaleway Console, you can change objects to a different storage class [manually](/storage/object/how-to/edit-storage-class/) or automatically with lifecycle rules. These rules also allow users to set expiration dates for objects and object versions.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created an Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)
</Message>

## How to create a lifecycle rule
1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the name of your bucket. The list of your objects displays
3. Click **Lifecycle rules**.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-lifecycle-rule.webp" alt="" />
4. Click **+ Create Lifecycle rule** to add a rule.
5. Enter a name for the rule.
6. Filter the objects you want the rule to be applied to by one or both of the following criteria:
    - **Prefix**: based on the object name. The defined rule will be applied to all objects with the same name prefix.
    - **Tags**: comprised of a **key** and an associated **value**. These tags should be defined prior to rule creation, for either a bucket or an object. You can add one or more tags to your filter.

## How to configure transition rules

If you wish to change the [storage class](/storage/object/concepts/#storage-class) of two or more objects at a time, you can set up a transition rule that will automate the process.

1. Click <Icon name="toggle" /> **Change object class** to transfer the current version of the objects to a different storage class.
2. Select the class.
3. Click **-** or **+** to set a deadline after which your rule's current version will be transferred to another class. You can also directly type in the amount of days you wish to set for your deadline. 
4. Click **Next Step** to proceed.
5. Check that all settings are correct and click **Create Lifecycle rule** to confirm.

    A list of the lifecycle rules displays.


## How to configure expiration rules

If you wish to delete an object after a set number of days, you can set up an expiration rule that will automate the process.

1. Click <Icon name="toggle" /> **Delete after expiration** to define when the current version of your objects will be deleted.
2. Click **-** or **+**, or type in the exact amount of days after the rule's creation you want the current version to be deleted.
3. Click **Next Step** to proceed.
4. Check that all settings are correct and click **Create Lifecycle rule** to confirm.

    A list of the lifecycle rules displays.


## How to disable a lifecycle rule

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. A list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the name of your bucket.
3. Click the **Lifecycle rules** tab. A list of your rules displays.
4. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to name of the rule. 
5. Click **Disable**.

    A confirmation window pops up.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-disable-rule.webp" alt="" />
6. Enter **Disable rule** if you wish to pursue the action.

    Once disabled, the lifecycle rule remains listed and can be enabled again. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Activate** to do so.

If you wish to permanently delete a rule, click  <Icon name="more" /> > **Delete**.
