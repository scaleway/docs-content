- You have a [Smart Labeling](/ai/smart-labeling/quickstart/) workspace

</Message>

1. Click **Smart Labeling** in the **AI** section of the side menu. The list of your workspaces displays.

2. Click on the workspace you want to access. The workspace overview displays.

3. Click **Go to my annotation server** in the workspace overview:

  The CVAT login screen displays.

    Alternatively you can use the **Annotation server URL** to access the server. You can find it in the workspace information block. This URL will take you (or the annotator) to the CVAT annotation interface.

5. Create tasks to annotate datasets of your choice with [image-level tags, as well as points, bounding boxes, polygons, and 3D boxes](https://openvinotoolkit.github.io/cvat/docs/manual/basics/types-of-shapes/) and assign them to your users.

  Users can log in to the CVAT interface to start annotating images in their tasks.


  <Message type="important">

  Annotators can create users who can also log in to the annotation server directly from this interface.
