**Aer** is the high-performance emulator framework for the [Qiskit software stack](https://qiskit.org/documentation/). It provides powerful backends to emulate quantum circuits with realistic noise models, using advanced optimization techniques.

While Aer can run on a local laptop, simulating complex circuits with many qubits requires significant computational power. **Scaleway QaaS** allows you to offload these heavy simulations to dedicated **GPU and CPU clusters** directly from your Python code.

## Why use Aer on Scaleway?

Scaleway provides a seamless bridge between your local Qiskit environment and cloud-based High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources:

* **Multi purpose emulation:** Aer is a robust emulator that supported many simulation methods: `statevector`, `density_matrix`, `matrix_product_state`, `unitary` and `tensor_network`. All this methods are supported by our Platforms.
* **Billed at time:** The billing starting time begins only when the Platform is fully operational and the first Job can be executed.
* **GPU acceleration:** Instantly allocate powerful Nvidia GPUs (like H100 or L40S cluster ) to accelerate tensor-network or statevector emulator.
* **Optimized stack:** We provide pre-configured environments (Platforms) tuned for high performance, ensuring Aer utilizes the underlying hardware to its full potential.
* **Noise model support:** Our Aer-based Platforms support custom noise model with you are willing to mimic a real QPU behaviour. See [further doc](https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-aer/apidocs/aer_noise.html).
* **Data compression:** To minimize latency and bandwidth usage, quantum circuits (upload) and emulator results (download) are automatically compressed during transfer.
* **Transparent pricing:** You connect to resources on-demand. The pricing model is similar to standard Cloud Instances: you pay for the compute resources allocated during your simulation time.

## How to access Aer with Scaleway

Aer emulator is accessible through multiple SDKs. [Please check SDK/Backend compatibility](/quantum-computing/additional-content/sdk-backend-compatibility).

To run your remote emulator, you simply need to switch your Qiskit backend to a Scaleway-hosted emulator.

The following example demonstrates how to run a computation on a Scaleway GPU instance. The workflow is identical to using a local emulator, but the computation happens remotely.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account with a valid **Project ID**
- A Scaleway **API Key** (Secret Key)
- Python and `qiskit` installed on your local machine

1. Install the `qiskit-scaleway` provider. Refer to the [Qiskit Scaleway GitHub repository](https://github.com/scaleway/qiskit-scaleway) for more information.

    ```bash
    pip install qiskit-scaleway
    ```

2. Create a file with the following computation script. Replace `$SCW_PROJECT_ID` and `$SCW_SECRET_KEY` with your Scaleway Project ID and secret key.

    ```python
    from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
    from qiskit_scaleway import ScalewayProvider

    # 1. Initialize the Provider
    # Ensure you have your credentials ready
    provider = ScalewayProvider(
        project_id="$SCW_PROJECT_ID",
        secret_key="$SCW_SECRET_KEY"
    )

    # 2. Select the Aer GPU Platform
    # Example platform ID: 'EMU-AER-H100' (Aer emulator using an Nvidia H100 GPU)
    backend = provider.get_backend("EMU-AER-H100")

    # 3. Create a Quantum Circuit
    # Let's create a Bell state with measurement
    qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
    qc.h(0)
    qc.cx(0, 1)
    qc.measure_all()

    # 4. No transpilation
    # Scaleway QaaS handles the transpilation server-side for you

    # 5. Execute on remote emulator
    # The job is sent to Scaleway, executed on the GPU, and results are returned compressed.
    job = backend.run(qc, shots=10000)

    # 6. Get Results
    result = job.result()

    print("Results:", result)
    ```

4. Save the script. In this example we save it as `aer.py`.

5. Run the script.
    ```bash
    python ~/aer.py
    ```
