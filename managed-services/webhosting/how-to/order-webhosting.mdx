This page shows how to create a Scaleway Web Hosting plan. Web Hosting is a managed service, designed for personal use, business use and everything in between. It allows you to host your website and databases and create personalized email addresses using your domain name.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Registered a domain name](/network/domains-and-dns/how-to/register-internal-domain/) at Scaleway or another registrar

1. Click **Web Hosting** in the **Managed Services** section of the side menu. This takes you to the Web Hosting dashboard.<br />
   If you already have Web Hosting plans, they will be listed. Click the **+ Order Web Hosting** button to add more plans.
2. Click **Order Web Hosting** to start the creation process.
3. Select a **region** and a **control panel** for your Web Hosting plan. 
     * You can choose between:
       * **cPanel**: A web-based control panel for managing web hosting accounts, emails, and websites through a graphical interface.
       * **Plesk**: A user-friendly web hosting control panel for managing websites, emails, and hosting accounts.

          Unsure which control panel to choose? Check out our documentation on [Understanding the differences between cPanel and Plesk](/managed-services/webhosting/reference-content/understanding-differences-cpanel-plesk/).
      </Message>
    * Click Configure Web Hosting to continue.
4. Follow these steps to configure your Web Hosting:
   - Enter your **domain name**. Remember, it must be pre-registered and you must be the registrant. Need to register one? [Read our documentation on how to register a domain name](/network/domains-and-dns/how-to/register-internal-domain/).
   - Choose a **hosting plan** based on your needs.
   - Decide if you want to enable the **backup** feature:
     - Enable it for daily automated backups of your website, emails, and databases. The feature retains backups for three days, with a full weekly backup retained for two months.
   - Choose whether to order a dedicated IP for your Web Hosting, which can improve email reputation and SSL setup.
   - Enter your **email address**. We will send your control panel password there.
5. Click **Create Web Hosting** to finish. Your Web Hosting plan creation starts, and you will be redirected to the **Overview** tab.
    Here, you can find information about your web hosting account, like the link to the control panel and your webmail interface.
