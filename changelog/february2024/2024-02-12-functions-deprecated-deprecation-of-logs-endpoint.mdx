Due to a lack of usage and a change impacting the storage of users logs, the `/logs` endpoint (or `ListLogs` for our SDK users) is now deprecated.
Users can still find their functions logs through their [cockpit](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/observability/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards/): a dashboard ("Serverless Functions Logs") is available there. See also [this documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-functions/#logs).
Users already browsing their logs through cockpit (logs are sent to users cockpit for 6 months now) won't face any change.
The `/logs` endpoint will cease to work in one month (March 12 2024).
