Elastic Stack, formerly known as ELK Stack is a bundle of three open-source software projects maintained by [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/). The stack comprises Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, and Beats. 
It's a comprehensive suite for real-time data search, analysis, and visualization. Elasticsearch handles data indexing and search, Logstash processes and routes data, Kibana provides visualization capabilities, and Beats ships data from various sources. Together, they offer an end-to-end solution for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing vast amounts of information in real-time.

The Elastic stack consists of: 

  - [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch), a NoSQL database based on the Lucene search engine.
  - [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/logstash), a server-side data processing pipeline that accepts data from various sources simultaneously, transforms it, and exports the data to various targets.
  - [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana), a visualization layer that works on top of Elasticsearch.
  - [Beats](https://www.elastic.co/beats/), a free and open platform for single-purpose data shippers.

### Install Elasticsearch:

1. Download and install the Elasticsearch Public Signing Key:
   ```bash
   wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -
   ```

2. Add the Elasticsearch `apt` repository:
   ```bash
   echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg] https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/8.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-8.x.list
   ```

3. Update the `apt` repository index:
   ```bash
   apt update
   ```

4. Install Elasticsearch:
   ```bash
   apt install elasticsearch
   ```

5. Start and enable the Elasticsearch service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start elasticsearch
   sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch
   ```

## Install and configure Logstash:

1. Using the same repository added for Elasticsearch, you can simply install Logstash:
   ```bash
   apt install logstash
   ```

2. Once installed, you can create and modify configuration files for Logstash to set up your data pipelines. These are typically found in `/etc/logstash/conf.d/`.

3. Start and enable the Logstash service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start logstash
   sudo systemctl enable logstash
   ```

## 4. Install and configure Kibana:

1. Install Kibana using the repository:
   ```bash
   apt install kibana
   ```

2. Start and enable the Kibana service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start kibana
   sudo systemctl enable kibana
   ```

3. By default, Kibana is accessible on `http://localhost:5601`. If you need to access it from a remote machine, edit the Kibana configuration file `/etc/kibana/kibana.yml` and set the server host:
   ```
   server.host: "0.0.0.0"
   ```

## Secure the Elastic stack 

It it important to secure your ELK Stack, especially if it is exposed to the public internet. Follwoing are some additional resources to complete your setup:

- [Use a firewal](/tutorials/installation-uncomplicated-firewall/) like `ufw` or `iptables` to restrict access to your Instance.
- [Secure Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-minimal-setup.html) using its built-in security features or with plugins.
- Consider setting up an [HTTPS reverse proxy](/tutorials/nginx-reverse-proxy/) using a third party web server like Nginx or Apache to access Kibana securely.

## Test the installation

Make sure everything is working:

- Elasticsearch Run the following command to test your Elasticsearch installation: `curl -X GET "localhost:9200/"`
- Kibana: Navigate to `http://your_server_ip:5601` in your web browser.

Now, you should have a basic Elastic stack up and running! Adjust configurations as needed for your specific use-case and further secure and optimize your setup for production use.
Refer to the [official Elastic documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/index.html) for the most accurate and up-to-date instructions and advanced configuration information.
