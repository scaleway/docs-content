## Step 1: Assess and document current cluster resources

Begin by documenting your existing cluster configuration. This includes namespaces, deployments, services, storage, and any custom resources or policies in use.

### 1.1 Inventory of resources

- **Namespaces**: List all namespaces in use.
- **Deployments and StatefulSets**: Identify all applications and workloads running.
- **Services**: Document `LoadBalancers`, `NodePorts`, `ClusterIPs`.
- **ConfigMaps and Secrets**: Export configurations and sensitive data.
- **Ingress Controllers**: Note any Ingress resources and controllers used.
- **Persistent Volumes and Claims**: List all storage resources.
- **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**: Document any CRDs and associated operators.
- **Network Policies**: Record any network policies in place.

### 1.2 Export manifests

Use `kubectl` to export the manifests of your resources:

```
kubectl get all --all-namespaces -o yaml > cluster-resources.yaml

kubectl get pvc --all-namespaces -o yaml > pvcs.yaml

kubectl get configmaps --all-namespaces -o yaml > configmaps.yaml

kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o yaml > secrets.yaml

kubectl get ingress --all-namespaces -o yaml > ingress.yaml

kubectl get crd --all-namespaces -o yaml > crds.yaml
```

<Message type="note">
  Be cautious with secrets; ensure they are handled securely.
</Message>

## Step 2: Set Up Scaleway environment

### 2.1 Create a Scaleway account

If you do not already have one, [sign up for a Scaleway account](https://console.scaleway.com/register/).

### 2.2 Install Scaleway CLI (Optional)

[Installing the Scaleway CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli) can simplify some tasks.

Run the following command in a terminal to install the Scaleway CLI:
```sh
curl -s <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/master/scripts/get.sh> | sh
scw init
```

Follow the prompts to configure your access keys.

## Step 3: Migrate container images to Scaleway Container Registry

Your new cluster will need access to your container images.

    </Message>
2. Click **Create cluster** to deploy your cluster. Once deployment is complete, the cluster appears in the clusters list.

### 4.2 Wait for cluster provisioning

- The process may take several minutes.
- Once ready, the cluster status will be **Ready**.

## Step 5: Configure kubectl for Kapsule

### 5.1 Download the kubeconfig file

1. In the Scaleway console, go to your cluster's **Overview** page.
2. Click **Download kubeconfig**.
3. Save the file to `~/.kube/kapsule-config`.

### 5.2 Update kubeconfig

```sh
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/kapsule-config:~/.kube/config

kubectl config view --flatten > ~/.kube/config_combined

mv ~/.kube/config_combined ~/.kube/config

unset KUBECONFIG

```
This merges the Kapsule `kubeconfig` with your existing config.

### 5.3 Set the current context

1. List available contexts to identify the name of the context for your Kapsule cluster
  ```
  kubectl config get-contexts
  ```
2. Set the Kapsule cluster as the current context by replacing `<kapsule-context-name>` with the context name for your Kapsule cluster.
    ```
    kubectl config use-context <kapsule-context-name>
    ```
3. Confirm that your context has been updated
    ```
    kubectl config current-context
    ```

### 5.4 Verify connection

```
kubectl get nodes
```

## Step 6: Adapt Kubernetes manifests and configurations

Your existing manifests may contain cloud-provider-specific settings that need adjustment to align with Scaleway Kapsule's configuration.

### 6.1 Review and modify manifests

#### Storage classes

- Update storage classes to match Scaleway's offerings.
- List available storage classes:
    ```sh
    kubectl get storageclass
    ```
- Common storage classes in Scaleway:
  - `scw-bssd` (Block Storage)
  - `scw-sbs` (Faster Block Storage)

#### Load Balancers

- Modify Service definitions of type `LoadBalancer` to use [Scaleway's Load Balancers](/network/load-balancer/quickstart/). Refer to our [annotations documentation](/containers/kubernetes/reference-content/using-load-balancer-annotations/).
- Ensure annotations specific to other cloud providers are removed or replaced.

#### Ingress controllers

- [Deploy an Ingress controller](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/deploy-ingress-controller/) compatible with Kapsule (e.g., NGINX Ingress Controller).

#### Networking policies

- Review and adjust network policies as needed.
- Ensure they align with Scaleway's network architecture.

#### ConfigMaps and secrets

- Ensure sensitive data is securely managed.
- Recreate secrets in the new cluster.

#### Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)

- Update PVC definitions to use appropriate storage classes.

### 6.2 Remove unsupported resources

- Remove any resources or configurations that are not supported in Kapsule.
- For example, certain annotations or cloud-specific resource definitions.

## Step 7: Migrate persistent Data and storage

### 7.1 Backup data from existing cluster

- Use appropriate tools to back up data from Persistent Volumes.
- Methods include:
  - **Database dumps**: For databases, perform data exports.
  - **File system copy**: For file storage, copy data to a temporary location.

### 7.2 Restore data to Kapsule cluster

- Create PersistentVolumeClaims in Kapsule.
- Restore data into the new volumes:
  - **Init containers**: Use init containers to populate data.
  - **Data import jobs**: Run Kubernetes jobs to import data.

## Step 8: Deploy applications to Kapsule

### 8.1 Apply manifests to the new cluster

```
kubectl apply -f adjusted-manifests
```

<Message type="tip">
  Ensure you are using the correct context for Kapsule.
</Message>

### 8.2 Deploy Ingress Controller

- Deploy NGINX Ingress Controller:
    ```
    kubectl apply -f <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.2.1/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml>
    ```

### 8.3 Verify deployments

```
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

kubectl get services --all-namespaces

kubectl get ingress --all-namespaces
```
<Message type="note">
  Ensure all pods are running and services are correctly configured.
</Message>

## Step 9: Update networking and DNS configurations

### 9.1 External DNS (if used)

- If you use external DNS, configure it to work with Scaleway's DNS or your DNS provider.

### 9.2 Update DNS records

- Point your domain names to the new load balancer IPs or addresses.
- Update A records, CNAMEs, or configure your CDN as necessary.

### 9.3 Configure SSL/TLS certificates

- Use Cert-Manager to manage SSL certificates in Kapsule.
- Install Cert-Manager:
    ```
    kubectl apply -f <https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.8.0/cert-manager.yaml>
    ```

Configure issuers and certificates as per your requirements.

## Step 10: Test and validate deployments

Conduct functional, performance, and end-to-end testing to verify the applications work as expected in the new environment.

### 10.1 Functional testing

- Access your applications via their URLs.
- Perform end-to-end testing to ensure functionality.

### 10.2 Performance testing

- Conduct load testing to verify performance under expected loads.

### 10.3 Monitoring and logging

- Set up monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to observe cluster health.
- Configure logging solutions to collect and analyze logs.

## Step 11: Switch over production traffic

### 11.1 Plan for cutover

- Choose a low-traffic period if possible.
- Notify stakeholders of potential downtime or changes.

### 11.2 Final synchronization

- Sync any data changes that occurred during testing.

### 11.3 Update DNS TTL

- Reduce DNS Time-to-Live (TTL) to allow for quicker propagation.

### 11.4 Update DNS to point to Kapsule

- Change DNS records to point to the new cluster's ingress endpoints.

### 11.5 Monitor traffic

- Ensure that traffic is flowing to the new cluster.
- Monitor for any errors or issues.

## Step 12: Monitor and optimize the new cluster

### 12.1 Resource usage

- Monitor CPU, memory, and storage usage in [Scaleway Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/quickstart/).
- Adjust node pool sizes or autoscaling settings as needed.

### 12.2 Security

- Review security configurations.
- Ensure network policies and IAM roles are properly set.

### 12.3 Cost monitoring

- Keep an eye on the cluster's costs.
- Optimize resource allocation to balance performance and expenses.

## Step 13: Decommission the old cluster

### 13.1 Ensure stability

- Allow the new cluster to run in production for a sufficient period.
- Confirm that there are no outstanding issues.

### 13.2 Backup data

- Take final backups from the old cluster if needed.

### 13.3 Delete resources

- Carefully delete resources in the old cluster to avoid incurring costs.
- Delete the cluster following your provider's procedures.

### 13.4 Update documentation

- Document the new cluster setup.
- Update any operational runbooks or procedures.

## Troubleshooting tips

- **Authentication Issues**: Verify kubeconfig contexts and credentials.
- **Resource Quotas**: Check for any limitations in Scaleway that may affect deployments.
- **Persistent Volume Issues**: Ensure storage classes and PVCs are correctly configured.
- **Networking Problems**: Verify VPC configurations, network policies, and firewall rules.
- **Image Pull Errors**: Confirm that images are correctly tagged and accessible in [Scaleway Container Registry](/containers/container-registry/quickstart/).

## Additional considerations

### Leveraging Scaleway features

- **Elastic Metal nodes**: For workloads requiring dedicated resources, consider adding [Production-Optimized or Workload-Optimized nodes](/compute/instances/reference-content/choosing-instance-type/) to your cluster.
- **Autoscaling**: Use cluster and [pod autoscaling](/containers/kubernetes/concepts/#autoscale) to handle variable workloads efficiently.
- **Private Networking**: Use [VPC and Private Networks](/network/vpc/quickstart/) for enhanced security.

### Cost management

- **Transparent pricing**: Familiarize yourself with [Scaleway's pricing models](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/containers/#kubernetes-kapsule).
- **Cost estimation tools**: Use Scaleway's tools or third-party services to estimate and monitor costs.

### Security best practices

- **IAM policies**: Set up proper [access controls](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-policy/).
- **Regular updates**: Keep Kubernetes and applications up to date with security patches.
- **Secrets management**: Use Kubernetes Secrets securely, and consider external secret management solutions if necessary.
