## What is Scaleway's Cockpit?

Scaleway's Cockpit is a monitoring and alerting solution designed for multi-source observability. Cockpit allows you to collect, store, and analyze metrics and logs from your infrastructure and applications, giving you insights into your system's performance and behavior.
Cockpits are scoped per [Project](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project).

## How does Cockpit integrate with other Scaleway products?

Cockpit integrates seamlessly with Scaleway’s ecosystem. It provides pre-built dashboards and alerts to monitor other Scaleway resources' performance.

## How am I billed for using Cockpit with my Scaleway data?

Cockpit is billed based on [pricing plans](https://console.scaleway.com/cockpit/plans).

Pricing plans specify:

- Retention time for your data:
    * includes data from [Scaleway resources integrated with Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-limitations/#product-integration-into-cockpit) and your external data
- Monitoring and alerting for your Scaleway data:
    * includes data from [Scaleway resources integrated with Cockpit only](/observability/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-limitations/#product-integration-into-cockpit)

Additional costs apply for sending external data to Cockpit. This means that you will be billed for sending **data from Scaleway resources that are not integrated with Cockpit**, or data from any other external resources.

Pricing plans are scoped per [Project](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project).

## How am I billed for using Cockpit with external data?

External data is any data that is external to Scaleway, or **data from Scaleway resources not integrated with Cockpit**. Refer to the [dedicated documentation page](/observability/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-limitations/#product-integration-into-cockpit) to find out which resources are integrated with Cockpit.

The retention time for your external data depends on the [pricing plan](https://console.scaleway.com/cockpit/plans) you have selected.

You will not be charged for **querying** external data.

- External metrics are billed €0.15 per million samples of metrics ingested, per month.
- External logs are billed €0.35 per GB ingested, per month.
- External traces are billed €0.35 per GB ingested, per month.

**Starting April 2024, Scaleway will apply volume discounts to bill external metrics**. This means that the monthly pricing for external metrics will be calculated in levels. **Scaleway applies six levels of volume discounts.**

| Levels       | Range                                    | Monthly pricing with volume discounts    |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Level one    | From 0 to 10 billion external metrics    | €0.15 per million samples                |
| Level two    | From 10 to 25 billion external metrics   | €0.13 per million samples                |
| Level three  | From 25 to 50 billion external metrics   | €0.12 per million samples                |
| Level four   | From 50 to 100 billion external metrics  | €0.11 per million samples                |
| Level five   | From 100 to 200 billion external metrics | €0.10 per million samples                |
| Level six    | From 200 billion external metrics and beyond              | €0.08 per million samples                |


Here is an example of how you would be billed for **sending 52 billion external metrics samples per month**:

- 10,000 million samples of metrics x €0.15: €1.500
- 15,000 million samples of metrics x €0.13: €1.950
- 25,000 million samples of metrics x €0.12: €3.000
- 2 million samples of metrics x €0.11: €2.200

**Total:** €6.650 per month with volume discounts instead of €7.800 without volume discounts.

## How do I send my own data to my Cockpit?

If you have set up an agent, you can send your data using our [dedicated documentation](/observability/cockpit/how-to/send-metrics-logs-to-cockpit/).

If you have not set up any agent, check out our [documentation](/observability/cockpit/api-cli/configuring-grafana-agent/) to find out how to 
configure the Grafana agent, push your data, and visualize it in Grafana.

<Message type="important">
 Sending metrics and logs for Scaleway resources or personal data using an external path is a billable feature. In addition, any data that you push yourself is billed, even if you send data from Scaleway products. Refer to the [product pricing](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/?tags=available,managedservices-observability-cockpit) for more information.

## Will my dashboards be impacted by the Cockpit regionalization?

Soon, a new version of Cockpit will be released. In this version, the concept of **regionalization** will be introduced to offer you more flexibility and resilience for seamless monitoring.

If you have created customized dashboards with data for your Scaleway resources before April 2024, you will need to update your queries in Grafana, with the new regionalized data sources.
