This page explains how to create an OpenSearch deployment using the Scaleway console.

## How to create a Cloud Essentials for OpenSearch deployment

1. Click **OpenSearch** in the **Databases** section of the console. The Cloud Essentials for OpenSearch dashboard displays.

2. Click **+ Create deployment**. A creation form displays.

3. Select an OpenSearch version for your deployment.

4. Select a region where your resource will be deployed.

5. Select a deployment configuration. You can choose between:

    - **High Availability**: ensures fault tolerance in case of node failure, workload distribution across all nodes for improved performance, service continuity during rolling updates.
    - **Standalone**: cost-optimized single-node deployment for testing environments and non-critical, small-scale applications, without redundancy.

6. Choose a node type for your deployment. Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/opensearch/reference-content/shared-vs-dedicated-resources/) for more information on shared and dedicated compute resources.

7. Define a storage capacity for each node. The total storage size for your deployment depends on the number of nodes provisioned.

8. Configure network connectivity for your deployment.

9. Create credentials to log in to your OpenSearch deployment. These credentials will grant `admin` access to the user.

10. Enter a name for your deployment, or keep the automatically generated one.

11. Review the estimated cost for your cluster, then click **Create deployment** to  finish.

You are directed to the **Overview** tab of your deployment.
