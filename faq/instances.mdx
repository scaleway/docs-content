## First steps

### How can I create an image?

You must [create at least one snapshot](/compute/instances/how-to/create-a-snapshot/) before creating an image.

See the documentation on [creating an image from scratch](/compute/instances/how-to/create-image-from-snapshot/).


### What is ImageHub?

Scaleway’s ImageHub is a catalog of system images that allow you to deploy, manage, and scale your favorite applications in seconds using image templates.


### What is a Marketplace image?

A Marketplace is an online store that offers applications and services either built on or integrated with Scaleway’s offerings.

Scaleway Marketplace provides information related to Instance images through variants named “local-images”. This information can include the Instance zone and identification, along with constraints regarding the applicable Instance types.

When you want to create an Instance using an image in the Instance [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/), you need to specify the local-image UUID matching the zone and Instance type constraints you fetch from the marketplace API.

Use the [Marketplace API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/marketplace/) to find the UUID of the image you want to use. Alternatively, you can use this CLI command:

  ```
  scw marketplace image get label=image_name
  ```

Replace `image_name` with the name of your image or distribution, e.g.: `ubuntu_focal` or `debian_stretch`.


## Billing

### How am I billed for my compute Instances?

Instances are billed on a pay-as-you-go basis, and their prices are made up of three parts:

* Instance price,
* Storage price (local or block),
* Flexible IP price.

You can change the storage type and flexible IP after the Instance creation, which may affect the monthly billing.

### What are the storage prices for Instances?

| Product           | All regions*           | PAR3              |
|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Local storage     | €0.000044 GB/hour      | Not available     |
| Local snapshot    | €0.000044 GB/hour      | Not available     |
| Block Storage     | €0.000118 GB/hour      | €0.000177 GB/hour |
| Block snapshot    | €0.000044 GB/hour      | €0.000066 GB/hour |

*All regions include `PAR1`, `PAR2`, `AMS1`, `AMS2`, `AMS3`, `WAW1`, `WAW2`, and `WAW3`. `PAR3` prices are shown separately.


### How much does a flexible IP cost?

Each Instance’s flexible IPv4 costs €0.004/hour, excl. VAT.


## Requirements and configurations

### What is the minimum volume size my Instance can have?

Your **system volume** must be at least 10 GB (125 GB for a GPU OS).


### What are the benefits of Dedicated Resources?

Dedicated Resources give you a more stable experience for compute-demanding workloads, offering benefits such as:
* No “noisy neighbors”,
* No “burst effects”,
* Optimization for demanding and specific needs.


### Which options are available to power off my Instance?

You can choose between four options when powering off your Instance:
* **Hard reboot**: Your Instance performs an electrical reboot and its data is kept on the local storage. We recommend always rebooting your Instance from the OS to avoid data corruption.
* **Power off**: All local volume data is transferred to a volume store, and your physical node is released back to the pool of available machines. The process duration depends on the amount of data archived.
* **Terminate**: Your Instance and its volumes are permanently deleted, but the attached flexible IP is preserved.
* **Standby**: Your Instance is stopped, but its data remains on the local storage. The Instance is still allocated to your account and can be restarted anytime.

<Message type="important">
  The **standby mode** is charged as a running Instance. To avoid being billed for an unused Instance, power it off and ensure no IPs or allocated storage are left in use.
</Message>


### Why do I have to specify the CPU architecture when creating an image from a volume?

ARM and x86-based Instances use a different instruction set, which requires specifying the architecture of the platform when creating an image from a volume.

An ARM CPU uses a Reduced Instruction Set Computing [RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer) architecture, while an x86 CPU uses a Complex Instruction Set Computing [CISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer) architecture.


### Can I reach my Instance using a DNS hostname instead of its IP address?

Yes, each Instance has two DNS hostnames associated with it: 

* A **public DNS hostname**: `<instance-uuid>.pub.instances.scw.cloud` 
* A **private DNS hostname**: `<instance-uuid>.priv.instances.scw.cloud`

Both are automatically updated when the Instance moves to another hypervisor, also changing its IPv6 and private IPv4. You can either use these hostnames directly or configure a [CNAME record](/dedibox-network/dns/concepts/#resource-records) linking to it.


### Can I migrate from a first-generation DEV1 Instance to a PLAY2 Instance?

Yes. Refer to the [changing the commercial type of an Instance](/compute/instances/api-cli/migrating-instances/) documentation.


### Can I migrate from my first-generation GP1 Instance to a PRO2 Instance?

Yes. Refer to the [changing the commercial type of an Instance](/compute/instances/api-cli/migrating-instances/) documentation.


### Can I boot my Instance from a Block Storage volume?

Yes. When creating an Instance, you can select Block Storage as a system volume type. This allows you to reboot Instances from the block volume on which your OS is stored.

You can also add a Block volume after creating an Instance and [choosing it as the boot volume](/compute/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes/#how-to-change-the-boot-volume).


## Offers and availability

### Which Linux distributions are available?

We provide a wide range of [Linux distributions](https://www.scaleway.com/en/imagehub/) and InstantApps for Instances.

You are free to bootstrap your own distribution.


### Which Linux distributions are available for Enterprise Instances?

We provide a wide range of different Linux distributions and InstantApps for Instances. Enterprise Instances will work with a selection of most-acclaimed images:

* Ubuntu Focal
* Ubuntu Bionic
* Ubuntu Xenial
* Debian Buster
* Debian Stretch
* CentOS 8
* Fedora 32


### Where are my Instances located?

Scaleway offers different Instance ranges in all regions: Paris (France), Amsterdam (Netherlands), and Warsaw (Poland).

Check the [Instances availability guide](/console/account/reference-content/products-availability/) to discover where each Instance type is available.


### What makes FR-PAR-2 a sustainable Region?

`FR-PAR-2` is our sustainable and environmentally efficient Availability Zone (AZ) in Paris.

This Region is entirely powered by renewable (hydraulic) energy. It also has an energetic footprint 30-40% lower than traditional data centers, thanks to the fact that it does not require air conditioning. Learn more about [our environmental commitment](https://www.scaleway.com/en/environmental-leadership/).

## Network

## Which Instances support IP Mobility?

All ranges are compatible except for Instances using the “bootscript” feature, which has [reached its end of life (EOL)](/compute/instances/troubleshooting/bootscript-eol/).

### Can I enable “Routed IP” on my bootscript Instance?

Instances using a bootscript are not compatible with Routed IPs. As the bootscript feature has reached its end of life (EOL), refer to [this tutorial](/compute/instances/troubleshooting/bootscript-eol/) for migration instructions.

### Can I revert the migration to “Routed IP”?

No, the migration is permanent.

### Will my Instance retain its public IPv4 after migration?

Yes, your existing flexible public IPv4 will be converted to a routed one and will remain unchanged after migration.

### Will my Instance retain its public IPv6 after migration?

No, you will receive a new IPv6 after migration.

### Will my Instance retain its private IPv4 after migration?

No, the Scaleway private IP will be removed after the migration.

### Will my Instance retain its VPC private IPv4 after migration?

Yes, your VPC configuration will remain intact after migration to a routed public IPv4.

### Can a resource with a routed IP communicate with a resource with a NAT IP?

Yes, they can communicate with each other using their public IPs.

### Are there any limitations on IP autoconfiguration with the routed IP feature?

Currently, additional routed IPv6 addresses do not autoconfigure on CentOS 7, 8, 9, Alma 8, 9, Rocky 8, 9 after migration.
Note that, both additional routed IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are not autoconfigured post-migration on Ubuntu 20.04 focal. However, the primary IPv6 continues to be configured via SLAAC. These limitations are currently being addressed.
