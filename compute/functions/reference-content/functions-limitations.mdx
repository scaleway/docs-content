## Configuration Restrictions

In order to ensure the proper functioning of the product, we restrict the use of certain ports and environment variables.

* Blocked Port: 
  * **25**: Due to potential abuse (SPAM), no outbound traffic is allowed through this port.

* Reserved environment variables: 
  * `SCW_*`: Reserved for product configuration (for example: token validation)
