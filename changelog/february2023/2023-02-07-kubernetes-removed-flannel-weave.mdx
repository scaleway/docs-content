From k8s version 1.25 onwards, all new clusters created in Scaleway Kubernetes will either be with `cilium` or `calico` as CNI.  
To benefit from the newest minor versions, we recommend you recreate your clusters on one of the supported CNIs. Find more details on [our migration policies here](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/containers/kubernetes/reference-content/version-support-policy/).
