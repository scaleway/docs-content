The image feature lets you create an image of your Instance, which contains all its volumes. You can use this image to restore your Instance and its data and create a series of Instances with a predefined configuration.

This feature is available on Instance types. Creating images of your Instance is free. However, keep in mind that as the image feature creates snapshots of your volumes, you will be billed for these snapshots.

<Message type="note">
  This creates an image that is a complete backup of your Instance including **all** of its volumes. The [snapshot](/instances/concepts/#snapshot) feature, on the other hand, creates snapshots of specific volumes. Consider [creating a snapshot](/block-storage/how-to/create-a-snapshot/) if you want to use different snapshot strategies for different volumes of your Instance, e.g., if it has one volume containing the OS and another containing application data.
