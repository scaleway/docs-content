## Getting started with Kubernetes: Part 1 - Containers & Docker

This is the first in a new series of practical videos to help you get started with Kubernetes in minutes. We will walk you through Kubernetes fundamentals for beginners.

Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform, so before using it we need to understand a bit about containers themselves. A container is a portable package of software that includes its own environment and dependencies.

We show you how to containerize two simple applications with the popular containerization open-source platform Docker, starting from the Dockerfile to the basic docker commands with examples. Finally, we demonstrate how to safely push the container images we have created to the Scaleway Container Registry, so they are securely stored in the cloud.

Future videos will show you how to deploy your containerized application with the Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule, and cover topics like load balancing and storage for your Kubernetes application.
