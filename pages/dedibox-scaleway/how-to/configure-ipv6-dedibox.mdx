<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created and uploaded your SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- [Linked](/dedibox-scaleway/how-to/link-dedibox-account/) your Dedibox and Scaleway accounts
- [Created](/dedibox-scaleway/how-to/order-dedibox/) and [installed](/dedibox-scaleway/how-to/install-dedibox/) a Dedibox server and transferred your SSH key to it during installation
- [Activated](/dedibox-scaleway/how-to/activate-ipv6-block/) an IPv6 block

The Internet Protocol Version 6 is the most recent version of the IP protocol used for IP addresses. The Dedibox network is wholly IPv6 compatible in all Availability Zones.

IPv6 can be used as the main IP of a server, and also for failover IPs by using the principle of virtual MAC.

Each Dedibox customer account comes with a /48 IPv6 block that can be divided into:
* as many /56 as you have servers.
* as many /64 as you have failover IPs.

You can assign these blocks to your Dedibox servers by using DHCPv6 and the DUID assigned to each of these blocks. To find more information on IPv6 on Dedibox, refer to our [quickstart](/dedibox-ipv6/quickstart/).
