This page shows you how to create and manage a Serverless Containers namespace. [Namespaces](/serverless/containers/concepts/#namespace) allow you to group your containers and share environment variables between them.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## Creating a Serverless Containers namespace

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The list of your containers namespaces displays.
2. Click **Create namespace**. If you have no existing Serverless Containers resources in your current Project, click **Deploy container**.
3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Enter a **name**, and optionally a **description** for your namespace. The name must only contain alphanumeric characters and dashes.
    - Choose a **region**, which is the geographical location in which your namespace will be deployed.
    - Enter any **environment variables** required for your namespace. Environment variables configured in a namespace will be available in all containers/apps within the same namespace. For each environment variable, click **+Add new variable** and enter the key / value pair.
    - Set secret environment variables (optional). **Secrets** are environment variables that are injected into your container and stored securely, but not displayed in the console after initial validation. Add a **key** and a **value**.
    - Verify the **estimated cost**.
4. Click **Create namespace only** to finish, or click **Create namespace and add container** if you want to [deploy a container](/serverless/containers/how-to/deploy-container/) next.

## Managing a Serverless Containers namespace

### Generating and managing access tokens

The Scaleway console allows you to generate authentication tokens to grant users and applications access to the containers present in your namespace.

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The containers page displays.

2. Click the containers namespace you want to manage.

3. Click the **Namespace settings** tab. Information about the region, registry endpoint and description of your namespace display.

4. Click **+ Generate token** to create an access token for this namespace.

    <Message type="important">
    The token key will only be available for copy once. Make sure to store it securely before leaving the page.
    </Message>

Private containers present in your namespace now require the authentication token to be executed, as shown below:
    ```curl
    curl -H "X-Auth-Token: <YOUR_NAMESPACE_TOKEN>" <YOUR_CONTAINER_ENDPOINT>
    ```

### Adding and managing environment variables and secrets

The Scaleway console allows you to define environment variables and secrets at the namespace-level to pass to the containers present in the namespace.

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The containers page displays.

2. Click the containers namespace you want to manage.

3. Click the **Namespace settings** tab. Information about the region, registry endpoint and description of your namespace display.

4. Add environment variables by clicking the <Icon name="edit" /> icon, **+ Add variable**, entering the key/value pair, and clicking <Icon name="validate"/>.

5. Add secrets by clicking the <Icon name="edit" /> icon, **+ Add secret**, entering the key/value pair, and clicking <Icon name="validate"/>.

The environment variables and secrets defined will now be passed to your containers. Every container in a **ready** state is redeployed to take the change into account.

## Deleting a Serverless Containers namespace

<Message type="important">
  - This action will permanently delete your namespace and all your containers will be lost.
  - This action is irreversible.
  - The Container Registry namespace associated with your Serverless Containers namespace will be deleted.
</Message>

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The containers page displays.

2. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the namespace you want to delete, and select **Delete** from the drop-down menu.

3. Type **DELETE** in the pop-up that asks you to confirm the action, then click **Delete namespace**.
