## ERPNext - Overview

[ERPNext](https://www.erpnext.com/) is a free and open-source ERP software designed for manufacturers, distributors and service companies. It comprises a full range of modules, including accounting, sales, CRM, purchasing, warehouse management, and inventory. Moreover, specialized modules are available, tailored to the needs of the education, healthcare, agriculture, and non-profit sectors. It uses a MariaDB database to store its data, is written in Python, and based on the [Frappé Framework](https://frappeframework.com/). It is written in Python, based on the Frappé Framework, and uses a MariaDB database to store its data. The application is available under the GNU GPLv3 license and its source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext).

This tutorial will show you how to deploy ERPNext 13 on a Scaleway machine running Ubuntu Focal Fossa (20.04 LTS). This could be a [Dedibox](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/), an [Instance](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/) or a [Elastic Metal server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/elastic-metal/).

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your SSH Key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
  - You have one of the following remote machines running Ubuntu Focal Fossa (20.04 LTS):
    - An [Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance)
    - An [Elastic Metal server](/compute/elastic-metal/how-to/create-server/)
    - A [Dedibox dedicated server](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/order-a-server/)
  - You have sudo privileges or access to the root user
  - You have configured an A-record pointing to your server's IP address
</Message>

## Configuring locales

Start by configuring the system's keyboard mapping for the console as well as the language and character encoding on the host. This step is required to avoid any possible troubles during the ERPNext installation process and does not affect the UI language you will use on the ERPNext web interface.

1. Log in to your remote machine using SSH:
    ```
    ssh root@<remote_machine_ip>
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      If you are logging into a Dedibox server, you may not be able to log in as root but rather as the user you created during installation. In this case you may need to prefix commands in the rest of this section with `sudo`.
    </Message>
2. Update the apt package manager and upgrade the software already installed on the system:
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
3. Create a new user. Some of the commands we will be running later in this tutorial should not be carried out as root. Here, we call the new user `mariecurie`, but you could call them `erpnext` or whatever you like. Enter a password for them when prompted. You can leave the user information at default values if you wish.
    ```
    adduser mariecurie
    ```
4. Give the new user sudo privileges:
    ```
    usermod -aG sudo mariecurie
    ```
5. Configure the locale of the system to `en_US.utf8`:
    ```
    localectl set-keymap us && localectl set-locale LANG=en_US.utf8
    ```
6. Open the file `/etc/environment` in a text editor and add the following lines at the end of the file:
    ```
    nano /etc/environment
    ```

    ```
    LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
    LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8
    LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    ```

    Save the file, exit the text editor
7. Reboot your instance using the `reboot` command.
8. Wait a minute for the reboot to finish, then SSH back into your instance with the following command:
    ```
    ssh root@<remote_machine_ip>
    ```
9. Switch to the `mariecurie` user.
    ```
    su - mariecurie
    ```

All following steps will be executed from the newly created user account `mariecurie` and by using `sudo`.

## Installing MariaDB

1. Add a MariaDB mirror to the `apt` configuration. ERPNext relies on MariaDB as database engine, but the version available by default in the repositories of Ubuntu is too old and not supported by ERPNext. The mirror allows us to install a more recent version on the system:
    ```
    sudo apt install software-properties-common
    sudo apt-key adv --fetch-keys 'https://mariadb.org/mariadb_release_signing_key.asc'
    sudo add-apt-repository 'deb [arch=amd64,arm64,ppc64el] https://archive.mariadb.org/repo/10.6/ubuntu focal main'
    sudo apt update
    ```
2. Install MariaDB using the `apt` package manager:
    ```
    sudo apt install mariadb-server-10.6 mariadb-client-10.6
    ```
3. Install the following packages which are required for ERPNext:
    ```
    sudo apt install libmysqlclient-dev python3-mysqldb
    ```
4. Run the interactive setup tool to finalize the installation of MariaDB:
    ```
    sudo mysql_secure_installation
    ```

    The setup tool asks you to enter the current MySQL password. As you have a fresh installation, no password is configured yet. Press _Enter_ to continue. When asked to set a root password for MySQL, press _Y_ and enter a secret password and its confirmation. Press _Y_ to remove anonymous users when prompted, then press _Y_ again to disallow root login, press _Y_ to remove the test database and _Y_ to reload the privileges to activate the new configuration.
5. Log in to the MySQL shell. We use a non-root user with superuser privileges: 
    ```
    sudo mysql
    ```
6. Create a database named after the user that you want to use for connections to your MariaDB server. In this tutorial, we use `mariecurie` again, but you can choose whatever identifier you like.
    ```
    CREATE DATABASE mariecurie;
    ```
7. Create the new user account and grant superuser privileges to it. Replace `strong_database_password` in the following command with a secure password for the user:
    ```
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'mariecurie'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'strong_database_password' WITH GRANT OPTION;
    ```
8. Flush the privileges to activate the new user account:
    ```
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    ```
9. Exit the MariaDB shell:
    ```
    EXIT;
    ```
10. Open the file `/etc/mysql/conf.d/50-server.cnf` in a text editor:
    ```
    sudo nano /etc/mysql/conf.d/50-server.cnf
    ```

    Add the code below. Then save the file and exit the text editor:

    ```
    [mysqld]
    character-set-client-handshake = FALSE
    character-set-server = utf8mb4
    collation-server = utf8mb4_unicode_ci
    innodb_read_only_compressed = FALSE

    [mysql]
    default-character-set = utf8mb4
    ```
11. Repeat step 10 for the file `/etc/mysql/my.cnf`:
    ```
    sudo nano /etc/mysql/my.cnf
    ```
12. Restart the MariaDB server:
    ```
    sudo service mysql restart
    ```

## Setting up ERPNext

### Installing prerequisites

1. Install the following dependencies using the `apt` package manager before continuing with the installation of ERPNext:
    ```
    sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https build-essential curl mariadb-client python3-setuptools python3-dev python3-mysqldb libffi-dev python3-pip libcurl4 dnsmasq fontconfig git htop libcrypto++-dev libfreetype6-dev liblcms2-dev libldap2-dev libcups2-dev pv libjpeg8-dev libtiff5-dev tcl8.6-dev tk8.6-dev libssl-dev libdate-manip-perl zlib1g-dev libsasl2-dev libwebp-dev libxext6 libxrender1 libxslt1-dev libxslt1.1 libffi-dev logwatch ntpdate postfix python3-dev python-tk screen vim xfonts-75dpi xfonts-base python3-testresources
    ```
2. Continue to install the required python dependencies and upgrade `pip`
    ```
    sudo -H python3 -m pip install --upgrade setuptools cryptography psutil
    ```
3. Download a script to add the NodeSource repository to your system and save it locally:
    ```
    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
    ```
4. Run the script to configure the NodeSource repository with the `apt` package manager:
    ```
    sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
    ```
5. Install NodeSource using `apt`:
    ```
    sudo apt install nodejs
    ```
6. Install `yarn` using `npm`:
    ```
    sudo npm install -g yarn
    ```
7. Download the `wkhtmltopdf` package in the `/tmp` directory. ERPNext uses `wkhtmltopdf` to convert HTML content into PDF files using the Qt WebKit rendering engine for generating printable invoices, quotations, and other reports.
    ```
    cd /tmp && wget https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/packaging/releases/download/0.12.6-1/wkhtmltox_0.12.6-1.focal_amd64.deb
    ```
8. Install the downloaded package using `dpkg`:
    ```
    sudo dpkg -i wkhtmltox_0.12.6-1.focal_amd64.deb
    ```
9. Copy all the relevant binary files from the installation to the `/usr/bin` directory:
    ```
    sudo cp /usr/local/bin/wkhtmlto* /usr/bin/
    ```
10. Make those files executable:
    ```
    sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/wkhtmlto*
    ```
11. Return back into the `/home` directory of the user:
    ```
    cd /home/mariecurie
    ```

### Installing Redis

ERPNext uses the caching features of [Redis](https://redis.io/) to increase database performance.

1. Install redis using the `apt` package manager:
    ```
    sudo apt install redis-server
    ```
2. Configure Redis to start automatically during system boot:
    ```
    sudo systemctl enable redis-server.service
    ```

### Installing the Frappe Bench CLI

As the ERPNext stack's major prerequisites are installed, go on by installing the Frappe `bench` command-line interface. It has been designed to assist users with installing, configuring, and managing applications using the [Frappe Framework](https://frappeframework.com/), like ERPNext.

1. Clone the `bench` [GitHub repository](https://github.com/frappe/bench) using `git`:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/frappe/bench /home/mariecurie/.bench --depth 1 --branch master
    ```
2. Install the `bench` CLI using `pip3`:
    ```
    sudo pip3 install -e /home/mariecurie/.bench
    ```

### Installing the Frappe framework

1. Increase Ubuntu's file limit with the following command. This may be necessary for the Frappe Framework installation to succeed:
    ```
    echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
    ```
2. Initialize the Frappe framework using the following command. Remember to replace `/home/mariecurie` with the proper home path of your user:
    ```
    bench init /home/mariecurie/frappe-bench --frappe-path https://github.com/frappe/frappe --frappe-branch version-13 --python python3
    ```

    This step may take a while. Note that the script is able to recover from warnings such as `Command not being executed in bench directory` and `x is not a valid editable requirement`.

    <Message type="tip">
      The Frappe framework requires specific versions of certain Python packages. In case the `bench init` command fails, install the versions required by running the following command: 
      ```
      sudo pip3 install markupsafe==2.0.1 setuptools==40.8.0 ansible==5.3.0 ansbile-core==2.12.2 jinja2==2.10.3
      ```
    </Message>

    Once the installation completes, you see an output like the following example:

    ```
    ✨  Done in 94.7s
    Done in 96.74s.
    INFO:bench.utils:setting up backups
    no crontab for mariecurie
    SUCCESS: Bench /home/mariecurie/frappe-bench initialized
    ```

### Installing ERPNext web application

1. Change into the directory into which `frappe-bench` has been installed:
    ```
    cd /home/mariecurie/frappe-bench
    ```
2. Download ERPNext using the `bench` command-line interface:
    ```
    bench get-app ERPNext https://github.com/frappe/erpnext --branch version-13
    ```
3. Run the following command to install any missing dependencies:
    ```
    bench setup requirements
    ```
4. Create a new site for your ERPNext installation. Ensure you replace the parameters in the command as appropriate:
    ```
    bench new-site your_erpnext_domain --admin-password 'a_secure_erpnext_admin_password' --mariadb-root-username mariecurie --mariadb-root-password 'your_mariadb_root_password'
    ```

    The site creation may take a moment, and you can follow the progress in the status bars:

    ```
    Installing frappe...
    Updating DocTypes for frappe        : [========================================]
    Updating country info               : [========================================]
    ```
5. Install ERPNext on your new site using `bench`:
    ```
    bench --site your_erpnext_domain install-app erpnext
    ```

    Once again you can follow the process in the status bar:

    ```
    Installing ERPNext...
    Updating DocTypes for ERPNext       : [========================================]
    Updating customizations for Address
    ```
6. Test the installation of the site using `bench`:
    ```
    bench start
    ```

    Bench will deploy a test environment and you can access ERPNext at `http://your_erpnext_domain:8000`. If you open this URL in your web browser, the ERPNext login screen displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-erpnext_test.webp" width="900" alt="" />

    Press `CTRL + C` in your terminal to stop the test environment.

## Getting production-ready

Our test environment has proven that our ERPNext installation is working, but some additional steps are required to secure it and make it production-ready. We are again using the `bench` command-line tool to install the following tools on the machine:

- **Fail2Ban**, a useful tool that analyses server log files for recurring patterns of failures, allowing us to block IP's trying to run bruteforce attacks against a server.
- **Nginx**, a versatile web server that will be used as a proxy to redirect all requests on the standard HTTP (Port 80) and HTTPS (Port 443) to the ERPNext application listening on port 8000.
- **Supervisor**, a service that ensures all required processes of ERPNext are constantly up and running. In case of any failure, it will restart them.

1. Run `bench` with the following parameters. Replace `mariecurie` with the name of your user owning the production environment if necessary. Ensure you execute the command from the `frappe-bench` directory of your user.
    ```
    sudo bench setup production mariecurie
    ```

    It will create the following configuration files:
      - **Nginx:** Two configuration files: `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`, and `/etc/nginx/conf.d/frappe-bench.conf`
      - **Fail2Ban:** One proxy jail (`/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/nginx-proxy.conf`), and one filter configuration (`/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nginx-proxy.conf`)

    The default values configured in these files are suitable for an essential start and the goals of this tutorial. However, depending on your workload, you may tweak them further.
2. Install [`certbot`](https://certbot.eff.org) using snap. To increase security, we will use TLS to encrypt the connection between clients and the server.Certbot is a tool that can manage the request and renewal of Let's Encrypt certificates and the automatic configuration of Nginx.
    ```
    sudo snap install certbot --classic
    ```  ```
3. Run `certbot` to obtain a Let's Encrypt TLS certificate and to reconfigure Nginx to use it:
    ```
    sudo certbot --nginx
    ```

    When prompted, enter your email address, agree to the terms of service, and choose to redirect all requests to HTTPS.
    Certbot will then request the certificate and update the Nginx configuration accordingly. A message displays once the configuration is done:

    ```
    IMPORTANT NOTES:
    Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
      /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_erpnext_domain/fullchain.pem
      Your key file has been saved at:
      /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_erpnext_domain/privkey.pem
    [...]
    ```
