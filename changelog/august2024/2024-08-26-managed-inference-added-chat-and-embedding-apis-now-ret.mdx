Managed Inference endpoints now return usage stats (number of tokens in prompt, completion and totals) both for streaming and non-streaming responses.

For streaming responses, the usage field is incremented in each chunk, and completed in the very last chunk of the response.

More details and examples in our [OpenAI API compatibility documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/ai-data/managed-inference/reference-content/openai-compatibility/).
