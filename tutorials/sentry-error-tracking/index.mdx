## Sentry - Overview

Sentry is an open source solution for error tracking in applications. It is written in Python and can provide real-time reporting of errors in applications based on a client/server architecture. You can easily integrate it into your applications via its SDK and let them automatically report the errors via common messaging tools like Slack, IRC and more. This helps reduce the time for development of your applications and increases the user experience.

You can find all reports on a dashboard which makes it easy to triage the problem - how often it occurs, which impact it has on the user experience of your application, which part of your code causes the problem and so on.

This tutorial details how to setup a [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) server on a Scaleway compute Instance to start error tracking in your applications.

## Installing Sentry

In this tutorial, we will install Sentry on an [Ubuntu Focal Fossa (20.04 LTS)](https://www.ubuntu.com) based Instance.

1. Update the system and install the required prerequisites.
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates certbot curl git gnupg-agent nginx python3-certbot-nginx sendmail software-properties-common ufw -y
    ```
    Sentry runs in a Docker container using `docker-compose`.
2. Install the GPG Key of Docker and configure Docker's software repositories.
    ```
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | apt-key add -
    add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
    ```
3. Update the apt package manager and install Docker-Engine using `apt`.
    ```
    apt update && apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io -y
    ```
4. Download the binary file of `docker-compose` and make the file executable.
    ```
    curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/2.3.3/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    ```
5. Enter the `/opt` directory on your instance and clone the `onpremise` repository of Sentry.
    ```
    cd /opt
    git clone https://github.com/getsentry/onpremise
    ```
6. Enter the `onpremise` folder and run the automatic installation script of Sentry.
    ```
    cd /opt/onpremise
    ./install.sh
    ```

    The automatic installer runs several compatibility tests on the system and installs Sentry. An output like the following example displays. Fill in the required information when prompted to do so:

    ```
    [...]
      Applying sentry.0106_service_hook_project_id_nullable... OK
      Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK

    ----------------
    You're all done! Run the following command to get Sentry running:

      docker-compose up -d
    ```
7. Start Sentry by running the following command.
    ```
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
8. Test the installation by pointing your web browser to `http://<your_instance_ip>:9000`. The Sentry login displays.

## Configuring a reverse proxy

By default, Sentry listens on port `9000`. Therefore we configure an Nginx proxy that listens on port `80` (for HTTP) and `443` (for HTTPS) and forwards all requests on these ports to port 9000.

1. Edit the file `/etc/nginx/sites-available/sentry.example.com.conf` and put the following content in it. Edit the `server_name` to the DNS name of your Sentry Instance:
    ```
        server {
          listen 80;
          server_name sentry.example.com;

          location / {
            proxy_pass         http://localhost:9000;
            proxy_redirect     off;

            proxy_set_header   Host              $host;
            proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
          }

        }
    ```
2. Create a symlink to enable the new site in Nginx.
    ```
    ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/sentry.local.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/sentry.local.conf
    ```
3. Restart `nginx` to activate the new configuration.
    ```
    service nginx restart
    ```
4. Run `certbot` to request a [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) TLS certificate for HTTPS connections to Sentry.
    ```
    certbot --nginx
    ```

    The interactive certificate creation wizard of `certbot` prompts for additional information during certificate creation:

    ```

    cancel): me@myemail.com <- Enter your email address

    IMPORTANT NOTES:
    - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
      /etc/letsencrypt/live/sentry.example.com/fullchain.pem
      Your key file has been saved at:
      /etc/letsencrypt/live/sentry.example.com/privkey.pem
      Your cert will expire on 2020-12-23. To obtain a new or tweaked
      version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot again
      with the "certonly" option. To non-interactively renew *all* of
      your certificates, run "certbot renew"
    - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
      configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
      secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
      also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
      making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
    - If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:

      Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt:   https://letsencrypt.org/donate
      Donating to EFF:                    https://eff.org/donate-le
    ```

## Disabling direct access to the Sentry application

We disable direct access to the Sentry application, running on port `9000` for security reasons. All requests to the application have to pass via the Nginx reverse proxy. To do this we use the [UFW firewall](/tutorials/installation-uncomplicated-firewall/).

1. Start by defining the policy, that refuses everything by default.
    ```
    ufw default deny
    ```
2. Enable outgoing traffic.
    ```
    ufw default allow outgoing
    ```
3. Authorize SSH, HTTP and HTTPS connections to the machine.
    ```
    ufw allow 22/tcp
    ufw allow 80/tcp
    ufw allow 443/tcp
    ```
4. Enable the new firewall configuration.
    ```bash no-copy
    $ ufw enable
    Command may disrupt existing ssh connections. Proceed with operation (y|n)? y <- type **y**
    Firewall is active and enabled on system startup
    ```

## Connecting to the Sentry interface

1. Connect from a browser: `https://sentry.example.com/` once the installation completes. 
2. Log in with the user created during the installation.
3. Provide additional information and parameters. The Sentry Dashboard displays:

4. Click **Projects** > **New Project** to create a new project. 3. Provide additional information and parameters. The Sentry Dashboard displays:

4. Click **Projects** > **New Project** to create a new project.   <Lightbox src="scaleway-sentry_project.webp" alt="" />

Your Sentry server is running now, and you can integrate it with your applications. You can also add additional features by adding different [Plugins](https://docs.sentry.io/server/plugins/) into Sentry. 

Sentry is a powerful tool you can use to automate your workflow and increase the user experience by reducing the time to market of your applications. There are many [SDK's](https://docs.sentry.io/clients/) for various programming languages available.
