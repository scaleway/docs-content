## What is Scaleway Topics and Events?

Scaleway Topics and Events is a managed messaging service that facilitates the sending of notifications or messages to a large number of subscribers, including email addresses, webhooks, and more. Topics and Events uses an in-house implementation of AWS SNS protocol

## What is SNS?

**S**imple **N**notification **S**service, or SNS, is a managed messaging service developed by AWS. It was released in 2010, and enables users to interconnect their applications and systems using a [publish/subscribe](/topics-and-events/concepts#publishsubscribe) pattern. Many publishers can send messages to [topics](/topics-and-events/concepts#topic), while consumers, e.g. applications, can subscribe to topics to receive all (or a subset) of messages sent to this topic. 

## What is the relationship between Scaleway Topics and Events, and AWS SNS?

Scaleway has developed its own service based on AWS SNS protocol. Scaleway Topics and Events does not have any dependencies on the AWS SNS infrastructure or offering, we use our own stack which is fully self-hosted and developed in-house.

Scaleway Topics and Events makes it easy to migrate your existing SNS-connected applications by providing a dedicated protocol gateway.

  - **Read**: receive messages from queues and topics.
  - **Write**: send messages to queues and publish in topics.
  - **Manage**: create or edit resources (such as queues and topics).

## Topics and subscriptions

You can [create topics](/topics-and-events/how-to/create-manage-topics/) and [subscriptions](/topics-and-events/how-to/create-manage-subscriptions/) via the Scaleway console.
