Spamhaus is a database that analyzes data and lists internet resources such as IP addresses or domains with poor [reputation](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#ip-reputation). Spamhaus tracks malicious activity (ransomware, malware, phishing, and spam) and produces several block lists that mailbox providers use to protect themselves against malicious activity.

Your [deliverability](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#deliverability) will be affected if you are blocklisted on Spamhaus.

## How to get a domain removed from the block list

Use the [Spamhaus Checker](https://check.spamhaus.org/) to see if your domain is listed. If your domain is listed, you will find out why and what you need to do to make sure it is not listed again.

Make sure you are sending emails to people who have agreed to receive them and to delete hard bounce emails. You can also [contact our support team](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets) to help you address the issue.

Once you have identified what the issue is, you can [submit a removal request](https://www.spamhaus.org/faq/section/General%20Questions#251). Once your removal request is received, Spamhaus will try and answer any questions you may have before approving the removal.
