Kubernetes Kapsule clusters are provisioned with a default security group as standard. Clusters deployed prior to May 2023 permit inbound traffic to the nodes.<br /><br />
Since May 2023, each Kapsule cluster comes with a default security group implementing an inbound `DROP ALL` policy, effectively blocking all incoming connections by default.<br /><br />
To activate the preinstalled SSH server for node access within the cluster, it is necessary to manually [configure a custom rule](/compute/instances/how-to/use-security-groups/#how-to-edit-a-security-group) in the cluster's security group to permit inbound traffic on TCP port 22.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster) a Kubernetes Kapsule cluster
  - [This feature is available on the nodes of your cluster](#how-to-know-if-this-feature-is-available-on-the-nodes-of-your-cluster)
</Message>
1. Click **Instances** in the side menu, followed by **Security groups** to view the [security group](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/security-groups) section in your Scaleway console.
2. Select "more" <Icon name="more"/> adjacent to the security group you intend to configure and choose **More info**. The security group's overview displays.
    <Message type="tip">
      Alternatively, click directly on the security group's name to display the groups' overview page.
    </Message>
3. Access the **Rules** tab to view the security group rules.
4. In the **Rules** section of the security group, select "edit" <Icon name="edit" />.
5. Configure a new custom inbound rule:
    * Rule: accept
    * Protocol: TCP
    * Port: 22 (standard SSH port)
    * IP range: Specify a CIDR IP range authorized for connection to your Instance. As an option, select **All IPs** to permit connections from any IP. It is recommended to resctrict access to your rule to a limited IP range for maximum security.
6. Confirm the security group configuration by clicking "validate" <Icon name="validate" />.
