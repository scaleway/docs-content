The [DNS zone](/dedibox-network/domains/concepts/#dns-zone) is the roadmap of the domain name. It contains all the required information to operate the domain on the Internet.

For example, A records will indicate where to find the website, MX records will indicate where emails should be sent etc.

This document shows you how to manage your domain's DNS zones.

## How to understand DNS records/entries 

The most common types of DNS entries are as follows:

| Type        | Description     | 
| ----------- | --------------- | 
| **A**       | Allows you to link a domain name with an IP address (ipv4) (`www.online.net.` IN A 212.27.35.195) | 
| **AAAA**    | Allows you to link a domain name with an IP address (ipv6) (irc.online.net. IN AAAA 2a01:e0b:1:f:2d0:b7ff:fea9:4da8)|
| **CNAME**   | Allows for the mapping between a DNS name and another DNS name (sql.domain.ext. IN CNAME mysql1.online.net.) |  
| **MX**      | Allows to set the responsible mail server for a domain (online.net. IN mx.online.net.). The DNS name MUST be an IPv4 and can not be an IP address or a CNAME. Priority defines the time in which the servers are contacted if there are more than one |
| **TXT**     | This record can store a string of 1024 characters. |
| **SRV**     | This registration enables automatic discovery services, this type of record is reserved for expert users ONLY. |

  Errors in the configuration of your DNS zone may result in the unavailability of your website or emails. The modification of a DNS zone is a function that should only be used by experts. We do not provide support for web hostings or domain names with DNS zones modified by the user.

## How to manage your DNS zones

You can manage multiple versions of your DNS zones at Scaleway.

Each modification on an existing DNS zone will launch the creation of a new temporary zone. Once you have finished your modifications, you will be able to create a permanent zone from the temporary zone and to set it as active to allow its usage on the Internet.

1. From the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net), click **Domain**. A list of your domains displays.
2. Click **Configure domain name** next to the relevant domain. 
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-domain-configure.webp" alt="" />
3. Click the **Edit DNS zone** tab.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-edit-dns-zone.webp" alt="" />
4. Note the following parts of the interface:
    - At the top of the screen, the **Select a zone version** drop-down menu lets you navigate between your different zone versions to modify them and set them as active.
    - The pen icon next to the zone name in the **Active Version** panel lets you manage the zone's options. Click the pen to edit the zone name or set it as active.
    - The list of zone entries in the lower part of the screen lets you add, modify or delete DNS entries in your zone.

## How to modify a DNS zone

1. From the **Edit DNS zone** tab, make your changes (eg adding or deleting an entry) in the current zone shown to you.
2. Click **Create a new version**.
3. Click **Set as active** and wait for propagation of the zone.
    <Message type="note">
      * **Provisioning time**: The provisioning of your DNS zone on the Dedibox side is done instantly. If you want to verify that your changes have been taken into account, you can directly query the servers `ns0.online.net` and `ns1.online.net`.
      * **Propagation time**: The time it takes to propagate a DNS zone depends on the TTL (or Time To Live). This is the default refresh information during which other DNS servers on the Internet keep the information about your DNS zone in their cache. By default this value is 24 hours (86400 seconds). You can edit the TTL to your convenience, knowing that the new TTL will not be applied until the next reload, at the end of the current TTL. On the Internet it is generally recommended to set a minimum TTL of one hour (3600 seconds). Many DNS servers will not respect your values if your TTL is below that value.

## How to use BIND configuration mode (Advanced)

To facilitate the management of your zones, reserved for experts, we provide you with the option of sending and downloading your DNS zone in the BIND format. This is the format mostly used for the configuration of a BIND DNS Server, and allows you to re-import your zones if they were previously in this format, or if you are used to it. 

1. From the **Edit DNS zone** tab, click the arrow in the middle panel next to **Open BIND file options**.
2. Enter the desired content in the text box that displays. Alternatively, if you want to recover your current zone, click the **Download** button.

    Here is an example of a DNS zone in the BIND format:

    ```
      ;; Zone dump from zone version "Zone 1"
      $ORIGIN mutu-essentiel.com.
      @ 3600 IN  SOA ns0.online.net. hostmaster.online.net. 20170209060437 10800 3600 604800 3600
      @ 86400 IN A 212.47.231.228
      * 86400 IN CNAME pf114.mutu-perf.online.net.
      @ 86400 IN MX 10 mxproxy-1.cloud.online.net.
      @ 86400 IN MX 20 mxproxy-2.cloud.online.net.
      autoconfig 86400 IN CNAME mail-autoconfig.cloud.online.net.
      @ 86400 IN TXT "v=spf1 include:spf.online.net ?all"
      db93577 86400 IN CNAME pf114.mutu-perf.online.net.
      phpmyadmin 14400 IN CNAME pf114.mutu-perf.online.net.
    ```
3. Click **Submit your zone**.
