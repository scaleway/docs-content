You define your Database Instance's node configuration upon its [creation](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/create-a-database). Two node configuration modes are available with PostgreSQL or MySQL Database Instances.

- **High Availability**: creates a secondary Instance with an up-to-date replica of the database. If the primary Instance fails, the secondary takes over requests.
- **Standalone**: a standalone database provisioned on a single node.

If you are standalone mode, you can change the node configuration to High Availability in the console anytime.

<Message type="important">
  Once you upgrade to the High Availability mode, you cannot revert to standalone.
