Domains and DNS allows you to manage and register your [internal](/network/domains-and-dns/concepts/#internal-domain) and [external domains](/network/domains-and-dns/concepts/#external-domain) and configure and manage their DNS zones. Register and (auto-)renew your domains easily! Domains and DNS provide support for queries via both IPv4 and IPv6.
