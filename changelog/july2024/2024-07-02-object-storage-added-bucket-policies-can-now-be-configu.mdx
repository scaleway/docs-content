You can now create, view and edit bucket policies directly from the Scaleway console, right next to your buckets list. Additionally, you can now see which buckets lack policies and get a centralized view of all your bucket policies. 

Simple and intuitive access management is key for reducing the risk of configuration errors and enhancing security. With a user-friendly interface that allows you to configure both IAM and bucket policies, [granting granular access to your Object Storage resources](/storage/object/api-cli/combining-iam-and-object-storage/) is much easier, and more reliable than ever. 

Refer to our [dedicated documentation](/storage/object/how-to/create-bucket-policy/] on how to create and manage your bucket policies from the [Scaleway console](http://console.scaleway.com) for more information.
