The personalized RAID configuration allows you to create a RAID mode that cannot be created via the management console of Online.net (RAID10, for example).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- A [Dedibox dedicated server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/) with an HP Smart Array P410 RAID controller

1. Click **Server** > **Server list** to display the list of your servers. Click the identifier of the server you want to configure. The server information page displays.
2. Click **iLO** in the menu on the right and validate the terms. Then enter your connection's IP address and click **CREATE**. Your iDRAC session credentials display. Login to iDRAC using the credentials shown.
3. The iDRAC dashboard displays. Click **Launch** in the **Virtual Console Preview** section to launch the Java-based KVM-over-IP applet. Once the server's screen output is visible in the KVM applet, reboot the machine.
