## Veeam Overview

[Veeam Backup & Replication](https://www.veeam.com/vm-backup-recovery-replication-software.html) is a proprietary backup application, developed by Veeam for virtual environments built on VMware vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisors.

The solution provides backup, restore, and replication functionality for virtual machines, physical servers, and workstations as well as cloud-based workloads.

A native S3 interface for Veeam Backup & Replication is part of the Release 9.5 update 4, available in General Availability since January 22nd, 2019. It allows to push backups to an S3-compatible service to maximize backup capacity.

The following schema represents the functionality of Veeam Backup and Restore which acts as an intermediate agent to manage primary data storage and secondary and archival storage:

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A machine running [VMware vSphere](https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere.html)
- An intermediate Instance running [Veeam Backup & Replication](https://www.veeam.com/vm-backup-recovery-replication-software.html)
- An [Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)

<Message type="important">
  - **[Glacier storage class](/storage/object/concepts/#storage-class) is currently not supported by Veeam.**
  If you use lifecycle rules to transition your objects from Standard to Glacier, you will lose the link between Veeam and your data. 
  In this case, your data will still exist, but it will no longer be usable. 
</Message>

<Message type="tip">
  By default, Veeam manages data in small objects of 1 MB/object. For optimal performance and storage of your backups, the configuration of **Local Target (Large Blocks)** in the storage options of Veeam is recommended. This setting allows you to store your backups in objects of 4MB/object:

  We are currently working on a new backend (available in private beta), which will remove this limitation.

## Configuring Veeam backup & replication

<Message type="important">
  A Veeam **Enterprise** or **Enterprise Plus** license is required to configure the Scale out Repository feature which is required for Object Storage. Contact your Veeam Account Manager in case you need a license upgrade. [More information on Veeam Backup & Replication licensing.](https://www.veeam.com/products-edition-comparison.html)

5. The local machine is pre-configured in this step. Click **Next**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-16.webp" alt="" />
6. Click **Browse** to select a folder for local backups, then click **Next**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-17.webp" alt="" />
7. Keep these settings with the default values and click **Next**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-18.webp" alt="" />
8. A summary of the configuration is shown, click **Apply** to apply the configuration to the repository:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-19.webp" alt="" />
9. Veeam applies the configuration and runs some checks. Once they have completed, exit the wizard by clicking on **Finish**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-20.webp" alt="" />

### Configuring a scale-out repository

## Troubleshooting

This section is designed to help you solve common issues encountered while performing the actions described in the procedure.

### Bucket access errors

#### Error messages

- `Failed to preprocess target Error: S3 error: Access Denied`
- `Error: Shared memory connection was closed.`
- `Failed to upload disk 'shadowSpec>'`
- `Agent failed to process method {DataTransfer.SyncDisk}.`

#### Cause

The application cannot access the S3 resource.

#### Solution

If you encounter one or several of the error messages above:

- make sure that you have the `ObjectStorageFullAccess` [IAM permission](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission).

- make sure that there is no [bucket policy](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/) preventing the application to access your bucket.

### Too many requests error

#### Error messages

- `Error: S3 error: Too Many Requests`
- `Code: Too Many Requests`
- `Shared memory connection was closed.`
- `Agent failed to process method {DataTransfer.SyncDisk}.`

#### Cause

Scaleway Object Storage applies a rate limit on PUT operations for safety reasons.

#### Solution

You can limit the number of concurrent tasks and update the timeout duration of S3 requests on the Veeam Backup & Replication server managing the backup copy operation by adding the elements below:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Veeam\Veeam Backup and Replication

S3ConcurrentTaskLimit
Type: REG_DWORD
Value: 8

Type: DWORD
Name: S3RequestTimeoutSec
Value: 900

Type: DWORD
Name: S3RequestRetryTotalTimeoutSec
Value: 9000
```

Then, restart every Veeam service, or restart the Veeam server.
