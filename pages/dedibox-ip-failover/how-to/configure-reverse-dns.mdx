Failover IP addresses allow you to assign multiple IP addresses to your server. This enables you to allocate different IPs to websites, virtual machines, or services.

Your failover IP can be routed at any time to your servers within a few minutes using the Scaleway Account Management console or API. By transferring failover IP addresses between servers, hosted services remain available without requiring IP reconfiguration.

You can add failover IP addresses to each server based on your offer and service level.

<Requirements />

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- A [Dedibox dedicated server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox)

## Configuring Reverse DNS

1. From your Scaleway console, navigate to **Server** > **Network Configuration**. The list of your failover IPs and IP blocks is displayed.

2. Click **Edit Reverse DNS**. The list of your current reverse DNS records appears.

<Message type="tip">
  Ensure that a valid **[A record](/dedibox-dns/concepts/#dns-record)** is configured and pointing to your IP address before updating the reverse DNS.

<Message type="note">
  Reverse DNS updates may take some time to propagate. You can verify changes using the following commands:

  - Linux/macOS:
    ```sh
    dig -x <failover_IP>
    ```
  - Windows:
    ```sh
    nslookup <failover_IP>
    ```
