At Scaleway, a certificate is automatically created and attached to a device upon creation, if you have not previously set up your own Certificate Authority. You also have the option of setting up a **specific certificate** for your device.

<Message type="important">
  If you choose to replace the certificate, the previous one will be deleted and cannot be recovered.
  If you want to use a different Scaleway-managed certificate you can delete the device and create a new one using the same device name.

  For a custom device certificate to be valid, it must be unique across all your Hubs.
</Message>

When using a custom device certificate, the device must present the certificate as provided during the certificate replacement.

Switching to a custom device certificate allows for greater flexibility through:

- different key sizes & algorithms.
- different timeframe validity.
- your own personal private key not to be shared on the internet.

1. Click **IoT Hub** in the **Managed Services** section of the side menu. The list of your IoT Hubs displays.
2. Click the name of the IoT Hub on which the targeted device is attached. The hub overview page displays.
3. Click the **Devices** tab of your hub. A list of your devices displays.
4. Click the name of the device for which you want to provide a custom certificate.
5. Scroll to the **Replace Certificate** section of the page. Then click **Replace Device Certificate**.
6. Click **Upload** to select your Device certificate `pem` file.
7. Click **Replace Device Certificate** to complete the replacement.

    You can now set up your device and use the certificate.
