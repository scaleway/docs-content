Serverless SQL Database is based on PostgreSQL engine and thus provides standard PostgreSQL compatibility for most PostgreSQL features and commands. Due to the nature of a managed service, autoscaling support and connection pooling support, some features are not currently supported. This means either the corresponding SQL command will not be authorized, or will not behave similarly to a standard PostgreSQL instance.

If you require strict compatibility with all PostgreSQL features, you can use [Managed Databases for PostgreSQL](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/quickstart/) instead.

## Unsupported SQL features

- Notifying and listening channels using the `NOTIFY` and `LISTEN` commands can be performed, but message delivery isn't guaranteed. 

    ```
    LISTEN channel;
    NOTIFY channel, 'message';
    ```

- Creating temporary tables or views is not supported. 

    ```
    CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE table as {query};
    CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW view as {query};
    ```

- Refreshing materialized view concurrently cannot be performed. 

    ```
    REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY view
    ```

    <Message type="note">
    You can still refresh materialized views without the `CONCURRENTLY` option.
    </Message>

- Asynchronous commands such as `PQsendQuery` and `PQgetResult` cannot be performed.

- Declaring a cursor in transactions with `WITH HOLD` is not supported.

    ```
    BEGIN;
    DECLARE cursor CURSOR WITH HOLD FOR {query};
    COMMIT;
    ```

- Creating subscriptions cannot be performed.

    ```
    CREATE SUBSCRIPTION subscription CONNECTION 'connection' PUBLICATION publication;
    ```

- Preparing transactions is not supported.

    ```
    PREPARE TRANSACTION 'transactionid';
    ```

## Unsupported SQL clients features

- Grafana: Serverless SQL Databases cannot be added as a PostgreSQL data source in Grafana 10.1 and older versions, as Server Name Indication (SNI) is not supported. However, this feature is supported by Grafana 10.2 or higher.

- The `client_encoding` option can only be set to `UTF8` or `UNICODE`:
    ```
    pgcli postgresql://{username}:{password}@{host}:{port}/{databasename}?client_encoding=UTF8|UNICODE
    ```
    Setting the client-side encoding to a different value, such as `SQL_ASCII` when connecting with a client is not supported.

## Unsupported configuration commands

- DDL (Data Definition Language) queries on objects such as databases and users cannot be performed. Corresponding actions can still be performed directly using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/), the API, Terraform, and [IAM](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users).

    ```
    CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE DATABASE database;
    CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE USER username;
    GRANT SELECT ON TABLE table TO role;
    REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE table FROM role;
    ```

- `SET` or `RESET` commands to change run-time configuration parameters can be performed, but will be shared across multiple clients and might be lost when a database switches to an idle state, or during autoscaling operations. 

    ```
    SET TIME ZONE 'Europe/Paris';
    RESET timezone;
    ```

- Security labels cannot be defined or changed.

    ```
    SECURITY LABEL FOR provider ON TABLE table IS 'label';
    ```
