The Llama-2-70b model is an instance of the Llama language model developed by OpenAI. It's part of the family of large-scale language models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer).
Llama models are designed to understand and generate text in multiple languages, with a focus on languages other than English.
The "2-70b" in its name likely refers to its version and size, with "70b" possibly indicating a model with 70 billion parameters. These parameters are the weights that the model uses to generate text based on the input it receives.
