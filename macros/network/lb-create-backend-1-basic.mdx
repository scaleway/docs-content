1. Enter a **name** for your backend.

2. Enter a **protocol** and **port** for your backend. The Load Balancer initiates connections to its backend servers using the protocol and port you define here. Available protocols are **HTTP** or **TCP**. 

3. Choose whether to activate **TLS encryption** (default setting is deactivated), to encrypt connections between the Load Balancer and its backend servers.

4. Choose whether to activate **proxy protocol** (default setting is deactivated), to transfer connection information from the client through the Load Balancer and on to the destination backend server. If you choose to activate proxy protocol, you are prompted to select the **version** to use.
