Slack is a real-time messaging platform that offers traditional IRC functionalities like direct messaging, private groups, and channels, but with a modern twist. By joining Scaleway's Slack workspace, you gain convenient communication channels with Scaleway teams and fellow community members. This allows for seamless collaboration and discussion about your ongoing projects on the Scaleway infrastructure, facilitating knowledge sharing and idea exchange.

## Signing up for Slack

1. Navigate to the [Scaleway homepage](https://www.scaleway.com/en/) and click **Slack Community** in the **Resources** section at the bottom of the page, or access it directly via [this link](https://slack.scaleway.com/).

2. You will be directed to the registration page. Choose one of the suggested **Single Sign-On (SSO)** methods or opt to **Continue with Email** by providing your email address.

4. Check your email for an account validation message. Once received, click **Join Now** to finalize the signup process.

Once signed in, you'll land on the Scaleway Community Slack workspace, where you'll find suggestions from Slack on how to get started, such as messaging someone, setting up a profile picture, or joining channels.

## Joining a channel

Channels in Slack are persistent chat rooms designed for discussing specific topics and projects. In the Scaleway Slack Community, you will discover channels dedicated to various Scaleway products and services, along with a general community channel for broader discussions.

1. By default, you are added to the **#community** and **#community-fr** channels. Click on **Channels** to explore additional channels you may wish to join.
2. Sort channels by _Channel name_, _Creation date (newest first)_, _Members (most to fewest)_, or _Members (fewest to most)_. You can also filter channels by _All channels_, _Private channels_, or _Archived channels_. Click on a channel to view it.
3. At the bottom of your workspace, you have the following options: **Join Channel** or **See More Details**. Click **Join Channel** to participate and send messages.
