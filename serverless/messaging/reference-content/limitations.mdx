## Usage limits

For the usage limits that apply when using Messaging and Queuing, see the dedicated section on our [Organization quotas](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/additional-content/organization-quotas/#messaging-and-queueing) page. Limits (quotas) apply to, for example, the maximum number of queues, streams, topics and consumers/subscribers, as well as to message retention duration and storage.

## VPC

Messaging and Queuing is not currently compatible with [Scaleway VPC](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/network/vpc/quickstart/).
