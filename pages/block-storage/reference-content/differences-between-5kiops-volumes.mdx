This page provides information about the differences between Block Storage legacy, Block Storage 5K IOPS, and Block Storage 15K IOPS volumes.

Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/instances/concepts/#volumes) to learn about the differences between Block Storage and Local Storage volumes.

## Block Storage volume types overview

## Block Storage 5K and Block Storage legacy comparison

|              | Block Storage legacy volumes | Block Storage 5K IOPS volumes |
|--------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Underlying hardware** | Built using older-generation SSDs. 5K IOPS split between read and write (total 10K IOPS). | Powered by modern NVMe disks. NVMe provides better performance and is optimized for high-speed operations. |
| **Performance** | Limited by older SSD hardware, slower data access, higher latency. | Better performance with NVMe disks, 5K IOPS for both read and write combined, faster and more efficient. |
| **Latency** | Higher latency due to older SSDs, slower application response times. | Lower latency, faster access times, ideal for quick data retrieval, smoother experience with NVMe. |

## Summary

- **Block Storage legacy volumes** rely on older, slower SSD technology, leading to higher latency and lower overall performance.
- **Block Storage 5K IOPS volumes** use advanced NVMe disks, offering improved performance, lower latency, and faster data access.

For tasks where performance and low latency are crucial, Block Storage 5K and 15K IOPS volumes provide a more effective solution due to the modern hardware and technological improvements.
