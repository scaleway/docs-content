An [ingress controller](/kubernetes/concepts/#ingress-controller) is an entry point that ingests your HTTP/HTTPS traffic and dispatches it to your services. More precisely, it is a reverse proxy that will dynamically configure itself and will forward HTTP/HTTPS traffic to your services.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created a [Kubernetes Kapsule cluster](/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/)

1. Navigate to the **Containers** section within the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) sidebar and select **Kubernetes**. The Kubernetes Kapsule dashboard displays.
2. From the drop-down menu, select the geographical region you want to manage.
3. Locate the cluster you want to modify and click on its name to access the **cluster dashboard**.
4. Within the dashboard, navigate to the **Easy Deploy** tab to display the Easy Deploy feature. Then click **Deploy application** to create a new application.
5. Select the **Application Library** application type. Then select the desired ingress controller for deployment onto your cluster.
   <Message type="note">
     You can customize the Helm chart or keep its default configuration. Helm charts are formatted in YAML. Keep in mind that any alterations carry inherent risks and may impact the successful deployment of your application.

6. Assign a name and namespace for your application.
7. Click **Deploy application** to initiate the deployment of your ingress controller.
