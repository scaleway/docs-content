By subscribing to the JMRP (Junk Mail Reporting Program), you can register your IPs with Microsoft's mail delivery system. This registration enables you to take appropriate actions in case your IP is identified as a source of spam, preventing it from getting blacklisted.

By default, the authorities use the IP owner's information (Scaleway/Online.net) to determine the association of a mail address with a specific IP. 
However, if you have properly configured the reverse DNS of your IP [you can find instructions on how to do this in our (how to configure reverse dns documentation](/dedibox-network/ip-failover/how-to/configure-reverse-dns), you have the option to select an email address within your domain.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage your IP reputation and maintain a clean email delivery system.

1. Open the JMRP website in your web browser using this link: [JMRP interface](https://postmaster.live.com/snds/JMRP.aspx).
2. Log in using your Microsoft account.
3. Provide the necessary information about your IPs.
4. Choose an email address associated with the domain of the reverse DNS configuration.
5. Complete the subscription process.
