## What is Topics and Events?

Scaleway Topics and Events is a product for creating managed messaging topics, using an in-house implementation of AWS SNS protocol. Previously, it was part of the Messaging and Queuing product.

## What is the relationship between Scaleway Topics and Events, and AWS SNS?

**S**imple **N**otification **S**ervice, or SNS, is AWS's [publish/subscribe](/topics-and-events/concepts/#publishsubscribe) notification service for the mass delivery of messages. SNS acts as a single message bus that can be sent to a variety of devices and platforms through a single code interface. It is also possible to adapt message formats to the particular needs of each platform. 

Scaleway has developed its own service based on AWS SNS protocol. Scaleway Topics and Events does not have any dependencies on the AWS SNS infrastructure or offering, we use our own stack which is fully self-hosted and developed in-house.

## Which subscriber types are supported by Scaleway Topics and Events?

The following subscriber types are supported:

- HTTP/S clients
- Serverless Functions and Containers
- Scaleway Queues

## Does Topics and Events support all AWS SNS features?
