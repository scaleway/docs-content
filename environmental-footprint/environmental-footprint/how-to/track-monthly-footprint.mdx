The environmental footprint estimation tool is currently in private beta. Sign up for the beta via [the Scaleway betas page](https://www.scaleway.com/fr/betas/#environmental-footprint-calculator).

  The monthly report shows the total environmental footprint of your Scaleway Organization. However, Elastic Metal servers are currently the only product considered in the calculation. Therefore, **only results related to Elastic Metal servers are shown in the report**.

1. Click **Environmental Footprint** in the Organization drop-down menu to go to the **Environmental Footprint Overview** page. The **Environmental Footprint** dashboard appears, displaying the list of your current and past monthly reports.

2. Click the <Icon name="download" /> next to the month for the report you want to download.
    The monthly report is downloaded to your local computer in PDF format.
3. Open the PDF file.
4. Read through the document, considering the following elements on the page:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-env-monthly-report-detailed.webp" alt="" />

    - **1.** The start and end date of the period being tracked (month).
    - **2.** The name of your Organization.
    - **3.** The total carbon footprint of your Organization per month, which takes into account the impact of the **manufacture** and **use** of all the components that run your active Scaleway products in relation to each service's useful life.

          For a detailed description of how the carbon emissions are calculated, refer to the [Environmental Footprint calculation breakdown](/environmental-footprint/additional-content/environmental-footprint-calculator) documentation page.
        </Message>
    - **4.** The total water consumption of your Organization per month, which is calculated on the basis of the [Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE)](/environmental-footprint/concepts/#water-usage-effectiveness) of the data centers in which each of your services are located, as well as the services' electricity consumption.
        <Message type="note">
          For a detailed description of how the water consumption is calculated, refer to the [Water Consumption section](/environmental-footprint/additional-content/environmental-footprint-calculator/#water-consumption) of the Environmental Footprint calculation breakdown documentation page.
        </Message>
    - **5.** The total water consumption and carbon footprint of each of your Projects.
    - **6.** The total water consumption and carbon footprint per geographical location (Region and Availability Zone)
    - **7.** The total water consumption and carbon footprint of each of your products.

For both the carbon emissions, and the water consumption, the power consumption of your active resources is used in the calculation. The way you use your resources has a direct impact on power consumption. Therefore, results may vary greatly from one month to another.

For example, if you start your Elastic Metal server on the 15th of the month and leave it running until the end of the month, the data will be calculated for the 15 days of use, not for the whole month. If you leave the server on, non-stop, in the following month, the impact data will be calculated for a full month.

<Message type="note">
  Currently, for the electricity consumption, which is part of the calculation, we rely on estimates based on internal tests in which the Elastic Metal servers were tested in different configurations. We will soon provide an electricity consumption agent to get your exact electricity consumption and provide more accurate reports.
