This page explains how to access and use the notebook environment of your Data Lab for Apache Spark™ cluster using the Scaleway console.

You can also use your Data Lab cluster using a separate notebook (JupyterLab, Zeppelin, etc.) running on a Scaleway Instance within the same Private Network as your cluster. Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/data-lab/how-to/use-private-networks/) for more information.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created a [Data Lab for Apache Spark™ cluster](/data-lab/how-to/create-data-lab/) with a notebook
- Created an [IAM API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)

## How to access the notebook of your cluster

1. Click **Data Lab** under **Data & Analytics** on the side menu. The Data Lab for Apache Spark™ page displays.

2. Click the name of the desired Data Lab cluster. The overview tab of the cluster displays.

3. Click the **Open notebook** button. A login page displays.

4. Enter the **secret key** of your API key, then click **Authenticate**. The notebook dashboard displays.

You are now connected to your notebook environment.
