## How to attach a failover IP

The routing of your failover IP will be updated. Once the blue dot turns green, your IP is operational, and you can configure it on your machine.

<Message type="tip">
  Alternatively, you can attach a failover IP by clicking <Icon name="more" /> and  **Assign IP**. Then, enter the ID of your Dedibox to attach the IP.

## How to detach a failover IP

1. Click **Dedibox** in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu.
2. Click the **Failover IPs** tab to display a list of your failover IPs.
3. Move your mouse over the failover IP you want to detach from a Dedibox server. Click the IP and drop it in the failover IP list on the left of the screen.

    The routing of your failover IP will be updated. Once the blue dot turns green your IP is no longer routed to the Dedibox and is ready to be attached to another machine.

<Message type="tip">
  * You can also drop the IP directly on another Dedibox to assign it to that machine without service interruption.
  * Alternatively, you can detach a failover IP by clicking <Icon name="more" /> -> **Reassign IP**. Then click **Unassign** in the pop-up to detach the IP.
