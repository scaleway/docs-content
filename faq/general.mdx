## Where is my data hosted?

## What is the authorization charge of €1 for?

We initiate what is called an "authorization charge" of €1 when you register a new credit card. 
This is a dummy transaction to check the validity of the card. The authorization will also carry a 4-digit Magic Code, displayed on your bank account statement. This Magic Code will be used to verify your credit card for your Scaleway account.
For more information refer to [how to add a Credit Card](console/my-account/how-to/manage-billing-information#how-to-add-a-credit-card).

## How to create a support ticket?

## How do I get in touch with a Solution Advisor? 

If you need help to choose and configure the best solution for you, [get in touch with our Solution Advisors](https://scwexperiences.force.com/contactus/s/?language=en_US).

## How Can I Reset My Password?

In case you have lost the password associated with your Scaleway account, you will be able to retrieve access to your account by using the “Lost Password” button on the Scaleway console.
However, if you need to reset your password, but you have difficulties accessing your email account, you will not be able to use this function. In this case, follow the authentication procedure described in our [documentation](console/my-account/how-to/recover-a-lost-password/).

## What is the difference between an image and a snapshot?

An image is a complete backup of your server including all volumes.
A snapshot can be done from a specific volume (for example you have a server with a volume containing the OS and another one containing the application data, and you want to use different snapshot strategies on both volumes).
Creating snapshots of your volumes gives you total freedom which volumes you want to back up while images are convenient for full backups of your instance.

## Do you offer IPv6?

`/64` IPv6 block are available on all our Instances. However, note that for our legacy servers including `START` and `VC1 /64` IPv6 block is available at the cost of an archive.
The subnetwork is automatically activated on new Instances. To benefit from an IPv6 `/64` subnetwork on an existing Instance, first archive it and then restart it.

## Why can I not send any email?

To avoid spam, remote mail ports (25, 465, 587) cannot be reached from our infrastructure by default. If you need to open the mail ports to send emails, you can enable them from the security group configuration:

<Message type="important">
The SMTP ports are blocked by default for security reasons. To enable them, complete the identification process (KYC) and upgrade your account to Build level.
</Message>

1. Click **Instances**, on the side menu of the Scaleway Console.
2. Click on the Security Groups tab.
3. Select the security group for which you want to enable SMTP ports.
4. Tick the checkbox Enable SMTP in the security group information.

The security group settings will immediately be updated on all your virtual Instances.
