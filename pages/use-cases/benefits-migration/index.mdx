## Benefits of migrating to Scaleway

Cloud migration is the process of moving applications, workloads, and data from one cloud provider to another. Organizations may choose to migrate their infrastructure to improve scalability, optimize costs, simplify operations, or modernize their infrastructure.

Choosing a provider has long-term implications: it impacts not only the technical performance of your infrastructure, but also cost control, compliance, security, and sustainability. Scaleway offers a European alternative to global hyperscalers, combining reliable infrastructure with transparency, sovereignty, and a strong commitment to environmental responsibility. 

## Why choose Scaleway?

Since its creation in 1999, Scaleway has supported developers, startups, and companies in building and scaling digital services. Over the years, it has grown into a full cloud ecosystem, offering compute, storage, networking, and AI resources that scale with your needs.

[Pricing](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/) is transparent and predictable: Scaleway offers hourly billing with monthly caps, predictive pricing, and no egress fees for most services such as Object Storage or Kubernetes.

Scaleway makes sovereignty a priority: your data remains in Europe and complies fully with GDPR and local regulatory standards.

What’s more, Scaleway is underpinned by nine data centers across France, the Netherlands, and Poland, all of which run on renewable energy. Scaleway’s average Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) for all data centers used was 1.37 in 2023, which is below the global average of 1.55.

Scaleway also has a track record of bringing new technologies to Europe: from ARM-based Bare Metal SSD servers in 2015, to Serverless containers, Apple Silicon M1 instances, and more recently RISC-V servers in 2024. In 2025, Scaleway began the SecNumCloud qualification process, further strengthening its focus on security and compliance. These milestones illustrate Scaleway’s ongoing focus on delivering cutting-edge technologies accessible to European customers.

On top of that, Scaleway designs and assembles most of its own infrastructure, operates entirely on renewable energy, and publishes clear environmental and cost data so that customers can make informed choices.

    Migrating to Scaleway means gaining access to a platform that is designed to adapt to a wide variety of use cases. Scaleway’s ecosystem supports multiple architectures, from dedicated bare metal servers, to containerized applications orchestrated through Kubernetes, and fully managed Serverless functions and containers. This variety allows you to choose the most appropriate model for your projects and evolve as your needs change.

    Scaleway’s services are built on a regional architecture, offering three Availability Zones within a single region in France, The Netherlands, and Poland. This allows organizations to build resilient architectures with true multi-AZ redundancy. Scaleway is also expanding its global footprint, with new regions planned in Italy and Sweden, ensuring wider coverage in Europe.

    Scaleway provides APIs and developer tools that make it simple to combine its services with those of other providers, enabling hybrid and multi-cloud deployments. For organizations that want to avoid vendor lock-in, this interoperability ensures long-term freedom of choice. [The Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) offers a clear, unified view of your infrastructure and links to the Scaleway documentation when necessary, making your cloud resources easier to manage. The Scaleway documentation website helps you adopt and configure services efficiently with quick start guides, glossaries to help you get familiar with technical terms, or more in depth content. What’s more, [Scaleway Learning](https://www.scaleway.com/en/scaleway-learning/), our training and certification program teaches you how to identify products that match your business needs, manage your team’s access to cloud resources, and optimize costs.

  <TabsTab label="Cost optimization">

   Many organizations turn to the cloud for cost savings, but without proper visibility and control, expenses can quickly rise. Scaleway addresses this challenge through transparent pricing, free egress on many services, and built-in cost management tools. Services are billed hourly and capped at predictable monthly rates, ensuring that organizations only pay for the resources they actually use.

   Beyond pricing, Scaleway provides a tool to monitor and control your expenses. Scaleway’s [Cost Manager](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/billing/concepts/#cost-manager) provides a clear view of consumption data and the ability to filter by period, category, project, or resource type. You can use historical data going back five years to analyze trends and inform budget planning. The Scaleway [Billing API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/billing/) further simplifies the process of consolidating costs, enabling accurate re-invoicing or budget allocation.

   As a complement, Scaleway’s [Notification Manager](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/account/how-to/manage-notifications/) helps organizations stay on top of billing and account-related events. Teams can be alerted about new invoices, expiring payment methods, or budget thresholds using customized notifications which can be sent either to existing organization members or to external recipients. This allows finance and technical teams to maintain transparency and accountability across the entire organization.

   Together, these tools allow you not just to lower your infrastructure costs, but to actually monitor, forecast, and optimize your usage.

    Security and compliance are central to Scaleway’s mission as a European provider. The company operates under a rigorous information security management framework, regularly reinforced through continuous improvement processes and external audits.

    Day-to-day practices include:

    - continuous asset and risk management to keep systems patched and secure
    - mandatory cybersecurity training for all employees, and
    - strong access controls, including Single Sign-On (SSO) and role-based permissions.

    Email systems are protected by advanced filtering, and phishing simulations are conducted regularly to strengthen awareness.

    Incident response is handled by Scaleway’s dedicated Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT). This team monitors systems for suspicious activity, assesses incidents, contains threats, and conducts forensic analysis when necessary. It also coordinates with partners and authorities to ensure that responses are effective and compliant.

    These practices are supported by internationally recognized certifications. Scaleway is certified under ISO/IEC 27001:2022 for its Information Security Management System and, since July 2024, has also been certified as a Health Data Host (HDS) in France. This certification covers selected products (Elastic Metal, Dedibox without customization, Object Storage, and VPC) in our French datacenters (DC2, DC3, DC4, DC5), ensuring that sensitive health data is hosted securely and in compliance with French law.

    In 2025, Scaleway entered the SecNumCloud qualification process, which represents the highest standard of cloud security in France and the EU. As a European provider, Scaleway also guarantees full compliance with GDPR, ensuring data protection and privacy.

    All of these measures are reinforced by sovereignty guarantees: customer data remains in Europe, and for HDS-certified offers, no health data leaves France or the EEA. Scaleway’s full control over its infrastructure minimizes the risk of foreign access.

  <TabsTab label="Sustainable cloud">

    Sustainability is at the heart of Scaleway’s approach. All data centers run on renewable energy, and the average PUE is well below industry norms. For example, DC5 achieves a PUE as low as 1.15 by using adiabatic cooling instead of air conditioning, cutting energy use by up to 40% while minimizing water consumption.

    Hardware is carefully maintained, reconditioned, and reused to extend its lifespan and reduce waste.

    Scaleway also gives you tools to track your own impact. The [Environmental footprint calculator](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/environmental-footprint/) provides real-time insight into the carbon and water footprint of your workloads, with data broken down by project, region, and product. This allows you to measure the exact impact of your infrastructure, include it in CSR and ESG reports, and make informed decisions when choosing between different products or deployment models.

    Migrating to Scaleway means making a strategic, environmental, and sovereign choice for the long term. Find out more in the [Scaleway Impact Report](https://www.scaleway.com/en/environmental-leadership/).
