This page shows you how to send [metrics](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#metric) and [logs](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#logs) to your [Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#cockpit). The Observability Cockpit provides you with 2 Remote Write endpoints to be able to push metrics and logs. You can push metrics with any `Prometheus Remote Write` compatible agent such as the [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/) or [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) agents.
You can push logs with any Loki compatible agent such as the [Promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/), [Fluentd](https://docs.fluentd.org/), [Fluent Bit](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/) or [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/introduction.html) agents.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Activated your Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/how-to/activate-cockpit/)

<Message type="important">
 - Having the default configuration on your agents might lead to more of your resources' metrics being sent, a high consumption, and a high bill at the end of the month.
 - Sending metrics and logs for Scaleway resources or personal data using an external path is a billable feature. In addition, any data that you push yourself is billed, even if you send data from Scaleway products. Refer to the [product pricing](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/?tags=available,managedservices-observability-cockpit) for more information.

1. Click **Cockpit** in the Observability section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Cockpit** overview page displays.
2. [Create a token](/observability/cockpit/how-to/create-token) from the **Tokens** tab.
3. Check **Metrics** and **Logs** for the **Push** permission when selecting your token permissions, so your token can write logs and metrics.
    <Message type="important">
     - Make sure that you create your token in the same region as the [data sources](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#data-sources) you want to use it for.
     - Once you have created your token, your secret key displays only once. Make sure you copy and save it before you exit the page.
    </Message>
4. Configure your applications to send metrics and logs to your Cockpit [endpoints](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#endpoints), using your newly created token for authentication.

    <Message type="important">
     - The `Prometheus Remote Write` endpoint to push your metrics is the following: `https://metrics.cockpit.fr-par.scw.cloud/api/v1/push`
     - The Remote Write endpoint to push your logs is the following: `https://logs.cockpit.fr-par.scw.cloud/loki/api/v1/push`

    ## Example: send Python logs to your Scaleway Cockpit on a new logs dashboard

    We need to install [logging_loki](https://pypi.org/project/python-logging-loki/) using the command `pip install python-logging-loki`.

    The following output displays:

    ```
    snippet_python_to_scw_cockpit.py

    import logging
    import logging_loki


    handler = logging_loki.LokiHandler(
        url="https://logs.cockpit.fr-par.scw.cloud/loki/api/v1/push",
        tags={"job": "logs_from_python"},
        auth=("api_key", "YOUR_COCKPIT_API_KEY_WITH_PUSH_LOGS_AUTHORIZATION"),
        version="1",
    )

    logger = logging.getLogger("my-first-python-logger")
    logger.addHandler(handler)
    logger.error(
        "Logging a python error with Scaleway cockpit example",
        extra={"tags": {"service": "my-service"}},
        )
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      If you are using the Scaleway Loki API, you can `POST` through the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, or `POST` directly using the following endpoint: `https://api_key:YOUR_COCKPIT_API_KEY@logs.cockpit.fr-par.scw.cloud/loki/api/v1/push`.

    Python logs are sent to your Cockpit from the Scaleway Loki API. Complete the following steps to retrieve them on the Scaleway Cockpit with Grafana:

    * Choose a [Grafana logs dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/13639-logs-app/).
    * [Log into Grafana](/observability/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards/) using your [Grafana credentials](/observability/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/).
    * Click the **Dashboards** icon, then click **Browse**.
        <Lightbox src="scaleway_obs_dashboards_browse.webp" alt="" />
    * Click **New** in the top right corner of your screen and **Import** to import your Grafana dashboard.
    * Load the URL for the [Grafana logs dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/13639-logs-app/) or enter `13639` in the ID field.
    * You can view your log line from the Python snippet.

5. [Log in to your Grafana account](/observability/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards).
6. Create your [Grafana dashboard](/observability/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards) and start monitoring your data.
