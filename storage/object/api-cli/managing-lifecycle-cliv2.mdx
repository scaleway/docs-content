[Scaleway Object Storage](/storage/object/concepts#object-storage/) is a service based on the S3 protocol. It allows you to store different types of objects (documents, images, videos, etc) and to distribute them instantly, anywhere in the world. In addition, many existing libraries or CLI clients can be integrated into your application or scripts.

You can create and manage your Object Storage from the console, or via the [Scaleway Command Line Interface v2](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli#scaleway-cli-v2) that uses external tools such as `rclone`, `s3cmd` and `mc`.
