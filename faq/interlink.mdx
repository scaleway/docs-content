## What is InterLink?

InterLink is Scaleway's product to let you create a secure, private connection between your external infrastructure, and your Scaleway VPC. This allows you to direct your traffic safely from your Scaleway infrastructure to your on-premises infrastructure, away from the public internet.

Currently, InterLink is available in **hosted** version only. This means that you must choose a compatible [partner](/network/interlink/concepts/#partner) to facilitate the physical connection between the external infrastructure and the Scaleway VPC. The physical connection may be shared between several clients, each allocated a specific amount of bandwidth for their InterLink.

For more information on how InterLink works, see our [detailed overview](/network/ipam/reference-content/overview/).

## What is the difference between a V C-Private Network, a site-to-site VPN and a Scaleway InterLink?

VPC is a logically isolated private network within a Scaleway infrastructure where you can deploy resources, such as Instances, Managed Databases or Kubernetes Kapsule, away from the public internet.

Site-to-site VPN allows secure communication between your on-premises network and your cloud-based VPC over the public internet.

Scaleway InterLink provides a hosted, private, and high-performance connection between your on-premises network and your VPC (physically hosted in a Scaleway data center).

## Does Scaleway InterLink support MPLS and L2 interconnections?

No, so far Scaleway InterLink only supports layer 3 interconnections in BGP mode.

## Which partners are available to host my InterLink?

You can see the full range of available partners in the Scaleway [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) when you create an InterLink, or via the [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/interlink/#path-partners-list-available-partners). If you're looking for a partner that isn't available, [get in touch](https://www.scaleway.com/en/contact-sales/) to let us know.
