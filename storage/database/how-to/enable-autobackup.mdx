Backups are logical data dumps of an individual database. They are useful when you need to restore a specific logical database. 

For Database Instances that use Block Storage volumes, Scaleway Database uses the [Snaphots](/storage/database/how-to/manage-snapshots/) feature to create autobackups. When the autobackup feature is enabled, the Scaleway Database Instances create and manage backups according to your backup schedule configuration.

  The autobackup feature is enabled by default upon the creation of an Instance. Simultaneously, a backup schedule policy is created. The default backup frequency is of 1 per day and the retention period of 7 days. You can change this default configuration after you create the Instance from the database information page.

  Although autobackup is enabled by default, you can disable the feature before you create the Instance, by unchecking the box in the creation wizard. You can also disable it after the Instance is ready.

You can restore your backup by following the procedure of [how to restore snapshots](/storage/database/how-to/manage-snapshots/#how-to-restore-snapshots).
