## Problem

The logs of my Serverless Function display the following message:

```
ERROR - Forked function has terminated with error error="signal : terminated" source=core
```

## Cause

This message appears when a Serverless Function scales down, reducing the number of running instances according to the autoscaling settings.

This message is system-generated and can be safely ignored. No requests were dropped.
