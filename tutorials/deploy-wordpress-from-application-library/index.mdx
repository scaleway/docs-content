WordPress is a well-known CMS (**C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystem) allowing you to create evolving websites.

This tutorial teaches you how to install WordPress on a Scaleway [Kubernetes Kapsule](/containers/kubernetes/quickstart/) or Kosmos cluster by using the [Application Library in the Easy-Deploy feature](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/enable-easy-deploy/). 
You can perform most of these steps directly from within the Scaleway console. 

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />
 
<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have a [Kubernetes cluster](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/) at Scaleway (Kapsule or Kosmos)
  - You have [kubectl](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/connect-cluster-kubectl/) installed on your local computer

## Creating a Kubernetes Kapsule Cluster and deploying WordPress

1. Go to the [Kubernetes dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/kapsule/clusters) in the Scaleway console.
2. Select the cluster you want to deploy WordPress to.
3. Select the **Easy Deploy** tab.

    The Application Library allows you to deploy a WordPress CMS application. You can use the search bar to locate the application. 
4. Click **Deploy an application**.
5. Select **Application Library** as the application type.

6. Search for the application you want to deploy using the search bar.
    <Lightbox scr="scaleway-kubernetes-wordpress-app.webp" alt="" />

    The default configuration for the application is set automatically in a [YAML](https://yaml.org) format when you select it.
    You can edit the configuration to fit to your application deployment within the YAML editor displayed.

7. Enter a name for your application and the Kubernetes namespace you want to deploy it to.
    <Message type="important">
      If no namespace is chosen, your application will be deployed in your cluster's `default` namespace. Deploying in the `default` namespace is not a good practice and it is highly recommended to split your deployments, services, and application in separate namespaces, thus allowing a more secure configuration of your cluster.

8. Once configured, click **Deploy an application** to deploy your application on your Kubernetes cluster.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubernetes-deploy-app-summary.webp" alt="" />

    You are then redirected to the listing page of our deployed applications.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubernetes-deployed-apps-list.webp" alt="" />
9. Check that the deployment is successful by running the command `kubectl get all -n cms-ns` in your terminal.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubernetes-kubectl-all.webp" alt="" />

    You can see that your WordPress application is running, and has even created a [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) database within your cluster to store our data on [Scaleway Block Storage](https://www.scaleway.com/en/object-storage/).
    You also have access to the Load Balancer that was created to access your WordPress using the external IP displayed.
10. Access your WordPress application by entering the external IP provided in a web browser. The WordPress website displays in your browser.

    <Message type="note">
    * When updating the configuration of your application, you may run into some errors returned by the API. Read these errors carefully, as they contain the instructions you need to solve them.<br />
    * When you update your WordPress application setup, you will run into an error that asks you to use the correct password to update the application.<br /><br /> 

    This behavior is a security measure as the Application Library automatically creates the missing credentials that are not set at the deployment of the application and stores them into secrets within your Kubernetes cluster.<br />
    To retrieve these secrets, you might need to run command lines such as the following:<br />
    `kubectl get secret --namespace "cms-ns" wordpress-mariadb -o jsonpath="{.data.mariadb-password}" | base64 --decode`<br /> 
    All required instructions are given in the error message.
