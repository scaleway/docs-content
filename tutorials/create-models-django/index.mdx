## Django Overview

Django is a web development framework for developing dynamic websites and applications. Django allows the use of less code and eases the creation of complex websites. It provides a very good structure and easy methods that help to do the heavy lifting when writing web applications.

To follow this tutorial, we assume that you completed the [first tutorial on Django installation and configuration](https://www.scaleway.com/docs/how-to-install-django-web-framework/).

<Message type="tip">

## Creating models

Now that your environment (`my-django`) is set up, we can create a new application. The difference between an application and a project is that an app is a Web application that does something. A project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular Web site. A project can contain multiple apps. An app can be in multiple projects.

1. To create your app, make sure you are in the same directory as `manage.py` and type
    ```
    python manage.py startapp polls
    ```

    We create two models: Question and Choice. A Question has a question and a publication date. A Choice has two fields: the text of the choice and a vote tally. Each Choice is associated with a Question.

2. Edit the `polls/models.py` file so it looks like this
    ```python
    from django.db import models

    # Create your models here.
    from django.db import models

    class Question(models.Model):
        question_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        pub_date = models.DateTimeField('date published')

    class Choice(models.Model):
        question = models.ForeignKey('Question',
            on_delete=models.CASCADE,
        )
        choice_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        votes = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    ```
3. To activate the app, edit the `myDjangoProject/settings.py` file again
    ```python
    nano myDjangoProject/settings.py
    ```
4. Change the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting to include the string `polls`
    ```
    # application definition
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.messages',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',
        'polls',
    ]
    ```
5. Run `makemigrations` to indicate Django that you've made some changes to your models
    ```
    python manage.py make migrations polls
    ```

    which returns

    ```
    Migrations for 'polls':
      polls/migrations/0001_initial.py
        - Create model Choice
        - Create model Question
        - Add field question to choice
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      You can read the migration for your new model if you like; it's the file `polls/migrations/0001_initial.py`
    </Message>
6. Run the migrations with the `migrate` command to manage your database schema automatically
    ```
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

    which returns

    ```
    Operations to perform:
      Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, polls, sessions
    Running migrations:
      Applying polls.0001_initial... OK
    ```

    The `migrate` command takes all the migrations that have not been applied and runs them against your database, synchronizing the changes you made to your models with the schema in the database.

## Playing with the API

1. Invoke the Python shell
    ```
    python manage.py shell
    ```
2. Paste the following content to the shell
    ```
    >>> from polls.models import Question, Choice   # Import the model classes we just wrote.

    # No questions are in the system yet.
    >>> Question.objects.all()
    []

    # Create a new Question.
    # Support for time zones is enabled in the default settings file, so
    # Django expects a datetime with tzinfo for pub_date. Use timezone.now()
    # instead of datetime.datetime.now() and it will do the right thing.
    >>> from django.utils import timezone
    >>> q = Question(question_text="What's your name?", pub_date=timezone.now())

    # Save the object into the database. You have to call save() explicitly.
    >>> q.save()

    # Now it has an ID. Note that this might say "1L" instead of "1", depending
    # on which database you're using.
    >>> q.id
    1

    # Access model field values via Python attributes.
    >>> q.question_text
    "What's your name?"
    >>> q.pub_date
    datetime.datetime(2018, 10, 31, 10, 54, 26, 985783, tzinfo=<UTC>)

    # Change values by changing the attributes, then calling save().
    >>> q.question_text = "What's your name?"
    >>> q.save()

    # objects.all() displays all the questions in the database.
    >>> Question.objects.all()
    <QuerySet [<Question: Question object (1)>]>
    ```

    Exit the Python shell by pressing Control+D.
3. Edit the `polls/models.py` to add a `__str__()` method to both Question and Choice.
    <Message type="note">
      The **str**() method is called whenever you call str() on an object. In Python 3, Django uses str(obj) in a number of places. Most notably, to display an object in the Django admin site and as the value inserted into a template when it displays an object.
    </Message>

    ```
    nano polls/models.py
    ```

    and paste

    ```python
    from django.db import models

    # Create your models here.
    from django.db import models

    class Question(models.Model):
        question_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        pub_date = models.DateTimeField('date published')

        def __str__(self):
            return self.question_text

    class Choice(models.Model):
        question = models.ForeignKey('Question',
            on_delete=models.CASCADE,
        )
        choice_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        votes = models.IntegerField(default=0)

        def __str__(self):
            return self.choice_text
    ```
4. Save these changes and start a new Python interactive shell by running python `manage.py` shell again
    ```
    python manage.py shell
    ```

    and paste the following to make sure our `__str__()` addition worked.

    ```
    >>> from polls.models import Question, Choice

    >>> Question.objects.all()
    [<Question: What's your name?>]

    # Django provides a rich database lookup API that's entirely driven by
    # keyword arguments.
    >>> Question.objects.filter(id=1)
    [<Question: What's your name?>]
    >>> Question.objects.filter(question_text__startswith='What')
    [<Question:'What's your name', 'What's up?'>]

    # Get the question that was published this year.
    >>> from django.utils import timezone
    >>> current_year = timezone.now().year
    >>> Question.objects.get(pub_date__year=current_year)
    <Question: What's your name?>

    # Request an ID that doesn't exist, this will raise an exception.
    >>> Question.objects.get(id=3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    DoesNotExist: Question matching query does not exist.

    # Lookup by a primary key is the most common case, so Django provides a
    # shortcut for primary-key exact lookups.
    # The following is identical to Question.objects.get(id=1).
    >>> Question.objects.get(pk=1)
    <Question: What's your name?>
    ```

## Rendering the application visible in the Console

1. When you are logged in, the `poll` app is not displayed on the admin console. To make it appear, edit the `polls/admin.py` to match the following:
    ```
    from django.contrib import admin
    from .models import Question
    admin.site.register(Question)
    ```
2. Reload the Admin Console and login.
    ```
    python manage.py runserver your_server_ip:8000
    ```

    You now have several questions on your admin interface.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-django_admin_questions.webp" alt="" />

    If you click `Question`, it displays the list of questions we added to the configuration file.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-django_admin_questions_2.webp" alt="" />

    Click each question to either edit or delete it.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-django_edit_question.webp" alt="" />

## Adding Related Objects

Now that we have the questions on the admin page, we need to configure the multiple choices response.

1. Edit the `polls/admin.py` to add the following
    ```
    from django.contrib import admin

    from .models import Choice, Question

    admin.site.register(Choice)
    ```
2. Reload the Admin Console and login.
    ```
    python manage.py runserver your_server_ip:8000
    ```

    You now have `Choice` displayed on your admin interface.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-django_choices.webp" alt="" />
3. You can add as many choices as you wish. Click **Choices** to add a choice.
4. Select your question and type your answer.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-django_choice_oceane.webp" alt="" />

    You now have a poll with questions and answers. If you want to customize your interface, follow the [official Django documentation.](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/tutorial02/#customize-the-admin-change-list)
