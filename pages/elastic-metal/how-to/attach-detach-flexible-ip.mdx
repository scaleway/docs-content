You can order up to 64 flexible IPs (IPv4 or IPv6) for each of your Elastic Metal servers. These [Elastic Metal flexible IPs](/elastic-metal/concepts/#flexible-ip) can be attached and detached from any of your Elastic Metal servers using the console's drag-and-drop interface.

<Message type="important">
  Scaleway offers flexible IPs for [Elastic Metal servers](/elastic-metal/concepts/#elastic-metal-server), [Instances](/instances/concepts/#instance), and [Public Gateways](/public-gateways/concepts/#public-gateway). Each set of flexible IPs is independent and can only be used with its respective product. Instance flexible IPs cannot be attached to Elastic Metal servers or Public Gateways, and vice versa.

## How to attach a flexible IP to an Elastic Metal server

1. Click **Elastic Metal** in the **Bare Metal** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Elastic Metal dashboard displays.
2. Click the **Flexible IPs** tab to display the list of available failover IPs.
3. Drag and drop the flexible IP from the **Flexible IP** panel to your server in the **Elastic Metal servers** panel to attach it to a machine.
   <Message type="tip">
      You can assign both flexible IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in the same way.
   </Message>
4. Click **Validate** to confirm and complete the allocation.
   <Message type="note">
      If you are using virtual MAC groups, all flexible IPs sharing the same MAC address will be moved from one server to another.
