This page shows you how to execute Serverless Containers from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com). The **Test** feature of a container allows you to run your code using a selection of methods to make sure it behaves as expected.

<Message type="note">
Testing **Private** Serverless Functions is not possible using the Scaleway console due to CORS limitations. Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/serverless-containers/how-to/create-auth-token-from-console/) for more information on how to secure and test a private function.
