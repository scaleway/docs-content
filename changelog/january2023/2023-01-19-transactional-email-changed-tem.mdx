- The new Transactional Email sending domain `scw-tem.cloud` is now available. If you are a new client, you can use this sending domain by default. If you were using the previous sending domain, you can [configure a new SPF record](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/add-spf-dkim-records-to-your-domain/) with `scw-tem.cloud` and delete the old SPF record.

- Emails returned with error code 452 (recipient's mailbox is full) will be deleted with no further attempts made to resend.

- A minimum number of characters is now required in an email to avoid it going to spam. The subject and the body of the email must respectively contain at least 6 and 10 characters.
