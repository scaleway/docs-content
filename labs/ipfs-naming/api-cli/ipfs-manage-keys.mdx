To manage your keys, we use [Kubo](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/command-line/), the official IPFS implementation in Golang.

## Export key using a Kubo client

To export your kubo client key and convert it to base64 for import into our naming service, you can use this sequence of commands.

1. Run the following CLI command to list the keys you own:
    ```
    ipfs key list
    ```
2. Run the following CLI command to export the key to a privkey.pem file:
    ```
    ipfs key export myKey -o privkey.pem
    ```

    <Message type="important">
        The key must be exported in libp2p-protobuf-cleartext format, which is the default.
    </Message>
3. Convert the file contents to base64 to import them into the naming service via the Scaleway CLI.
    ```
     cat privkey.pem | base64
    ```

## Import key to Kubo client

Once you have exported your key from the Scaleway IPFS service, you will get your key in base64. Then you can import the key into Kubo client. 

1. Run the following CLI command to decode your base64 key into a binary file:
    ```
    base64 -d myKeyFileBase64 > privkey.pem
    ```

2. Run the following CLI command to import your decoded key into your Kubo client:
    ```
    ipfs key import myKey privkey.pem
    ```
