import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'


Users can connect to a database and access its data.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
- A [MongoDB® Database Instance](/managed-mongodb-databases/quickstart)

## How to create a new user

1. Click **MongoDB® Databases** under **Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Go to the **Users** tab.
4. Click **Create user**. A pop-up appears.
5. Enter a username and password for the user.
6. Click **Create User** to confirm. Your user is created. The privilege configuration wizard displays.
7. Set the privileges of your new user. You can select one or both of the following:

    - **Global roles** - the privileges you set will apply to all your databases, existing and future. You can set one or more global roll at a time. The available global roles include:
        - **Ready-only** (`read`) - Read privileges on all non-system collections and the `system.js` collection.
        - **Read and write** (`read_write`) - Read and write privileges on all non-system collections and the `system.js` collection.
        - **Sync** (`sync`) - Role that aggregates three MongoDB roles: `clusterMonitor`, `backup` and `restore`. This role can only be granted as a global role
        - **DB admin** (`db_admin`) - Privileges to perform administrative tasks on the database, such as schema-related tasks, indexing, and gathering statistics. This role does not grant privileges for user and role management.
    - **Specific roles** - the privileges will only apply to the databases you define. All global roles except `sync` can also be defined as specific roles.

        <Message type="important">
          You can manually enter a database that does not yet appear in the list and set privileges for it. This might be helpful as it can take up to 15 minutes before a recently created database appears in the list. You can also set privileges for databases before you create them. Keep in mind that the name you define in this step must be identical in spelling to that of the actual database.
        </Message>

        <Message type="tip">
        Refer to the [official MongoDB® documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/built-in-roles/) for an extensive list of the privileges granted to each role.
        </Message>

    If you set a **global role**, select one or more roles in the drop-down.

    If you set **specific roles**, enter the database(s) to which you want to apply the role first, then click **Set privileges**.
    Check the box corresponding to the role(s) you wish to apply to each database in the list.

8. Click **Confirm** after reviewing your configuration.

The list of your users is updated. You can see an overview of the global and speficic roles next to the name of each user.
