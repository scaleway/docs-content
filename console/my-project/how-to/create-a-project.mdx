If you have a [Scaleway account](/console/my-account/how-to/create-an-account), and subsequently an [Organization](/console/my-project/concepts/#organization), you will also automatically have a [default Project](/console/my-project/concepts/#default-project), that contains all your existing [resources](/console/my-project/concepts/#resources). You can also create additional Projects, allowing you to group your resources.

<Message type="note">
  The default Project takes on the Organization ID. Therefore, the **default** status cannot be transferred to other Projects, nor can the default Project's name be altered.

1. From the Organization Dashboard which displays when you log into the console, click the **Projects** tab. A list of your Projects displays.

3. Enter the **Project Name** and **Description** in the corresponding boxes. 
4. Click **Create new Project** and the new Project is added to the list.
