This page shows you how to create and manage an authentication token from the console.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [functions namespace](/serverless/functions/how-to/create-a-function/)
- A [function](/serverless/functions/how-to/create-a-function/)

## Creating authentication tokens from the console

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The Serverless Functions page displays.

2. Click the relevant functions namespace to see a list of functions in this namespace.

3. Click the name of the relevant function in the **Functions** tab. The function's **Code** tab displays.

4. Click the **Security** tab. The function's security settings page displays.

5. Set the **privacy policy** to **private**.

6. Click **Generate token**. A pop-up displays.

7. Enter the token description and set an expiration date for the token. Optionally, tick the box **No expiration date**, to have a token with unlimited validity. Then click **Generate token**.

8. Copy the token from the pop-up and store it in a safe environment.

    The token key will only be available for copy once. Make sure to store it securely before leaving the page.

## Using tokens

To use the token, you have to add the generated token to an `X-Auth-Token` header.

To execute a private function by providing a token using `curl`, run the following command:

```bash
curl -H "X-Auth-Token: <YOUR_FUNCTION_TOKEN>" <YOUR_FUNCTION_ENDPOINT>
```

A **private** function observes this behavior:

* If a call is made without the `X-Auth-Token` header, the call is rejected (status code 403).
* If a call is made with the `X-Auth-Token` header, the token is validated using a public key attached to the namespace.

## Deleting tokens

Tokens will expire by default on their given expiry date. You can delete them manually if they are no longer needed.

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The Serverless Functions page displays.

2. Click the relevant functions namespace to see a list of functions in this namespace.

3. Click the name of the relevant function in the **Functions** tab. The function's **Code** tab displays.

4. Click the **Security** tab. A list of your functions settings displays.

5. Click <Icon name="delete" /> in the **Tokens** panel. A pop-up displays.

6. Confirm by clicking **Delete token** to delete the token and revoke access to the function.

    <Message type="important">

    This action is irreversible and this token will not be able to access your function anymore.
