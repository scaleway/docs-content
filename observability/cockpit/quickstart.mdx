Scaleway's Observability Cockpit allows you to monitor your applications and their infrastructure by giving you insights and context into their behavior. Cockpit also enables you to visualize your metrics, logs and traces through a Grafana dashboard.

The Observability Cockpit provides you with four [endpoints](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#endpoints) to push metrics, logs, and traces. You can push metrics with any Prometheus-compatible agent such as [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/) or [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/).
You can push logs with any Loki-compatible agent such as [Promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/), [Fluentd](https://docs.fluentd.org/), [Fluent Bit](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/) or [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/introduction.html).
You can push traces with the Tempo-compatible agent supported by Scaleway: [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/what-is-opentelemetry/).

Read [our documentation](/observability/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-limitations/) to find out which Scaleway products are integrated into Cockpit and learn [how to reduce extra costs and understand Cockpit pricing](/observability/cockpit/reference-content/understanding-cockpit-usage/).

In this quickstart, we show you how to activate your Cockpit, how to retrieve your Grafana credentials and how to create a push token to send metrics and logs to your Cockpit.

  You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)

<Message type="important">
 - Having the default configuration on your agents might lead to more of your resources' metrics being sent, a high consumption and a high bill at the end of the month.
 - Sending metrics and logs for Scaleway resources or personal data using an external path is a billable feature. In addition, any data that you push yourself is billed, even if you send data from Scaleway products. Refer to the [product pricing](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/?tags=available,managedservices-observability-cockpit) for more information.
