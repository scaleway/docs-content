The [secret](/secret-manager/concepts/#secret) creation process slightly differs depending on whether you are using Secret Manager for the first time or not. Upon secret creation, you are prompted to choose a Scaleway-managed encryption key or specify an existing [Key Manager](/key-manager) key which will encrypt your data. This allows for secure and flexible encryption of your data, compliant with industry standards.

This page explains how to create a [secret](/secret-manager/concepts/#secret) for the first time using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) and how to create a secret if you have already created resources in Secret Manager.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

      1. Click **Secret Manager** in the **Security & Identity** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu.
      2. In the **Region** drop-down, select the [region](/secret-manager/concepts/#region) in which you want to store your secret.
          <Message type="important">
          Secrets cannot be moved from one region to another after creation.
          </Message>
      3. Click **+ Create secret**.
      4. Add your secret:
          - Choose whether to add your secret manually or import it.
              <Message type="note">
              The maximum file size for your secret is 64 KiB.
              </Message>
          - Choose a [secret type](/secret-manager/concepts/#secret-types) and enter or upload your secret value.
      5. Choose a Key Manager encryption key:
          - Scaleway-managed encryption key: requires no configuration on your side.

          - Manually-managed encryption key: an existing [Key Manager](/key-manager) key you have previously created.
      6. Choose a [path](/secret-manager/concepts/#path) for your secret.
          <Message type="important">
          A [path](/secret-manager/concepts/#path) is the directory structure to access your secrets and their [versions](/secret-manager/concepts/#version). Each path **must be prefixed** with a slash.
          </Message>
      7. Enter a name for your secret, and, optionally, add a description and tags.
      8. Optionally, click <Icon name="toggle" /> to enable [secret protection](/secret-manager/concepts/#secret-protection).
      9. Optionally, click <Icon name="toggle" /> next to **Enable single access** or **Enable Time to Live** to apply an [ephemeral policy](/secret-manager/concepts/#ephemeral-policy) to your secret and its versions.
          <Message type="important">
          - **Single access**: allows you to set your secret versions to **expire after one single access**.
          - **Time to Live**: allows you to set a time frame of up to one year, during which your secret versions are valid and accessible.
          - The ephemeral policy can only be applied to a secret at creation, and **cannot be removed** once applied.
          - Once applied to a secret, the ephemeral policy's settings will be applied to all the secret's versions (even those created subsequently).
          </Message>
      10. Check the estimated cost and click **Create secret** to confirm. The **Overview** tab of your secret displays with information such as the region of your secret, its encryption key, the secret's ID, etc.
          <Message type="note">
