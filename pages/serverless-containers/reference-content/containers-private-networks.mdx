## Compatibility

Scaleway Serverless Containers support [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](/vpc/) and can be attached to a Private Network, which allows you to securely connect your resources in an isolated environment. Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/serverless-containers/how-to/use-private-networks/) for more information.

## Features

- Containers in the same namespace can be attached to different Private Networks.
- Both [sandbox](/serverless-containers/concepts/#sandbox) environments (`V1` and `V2`) are compatible with Private Networks.
- Attaching Serverless Containers to Private Networks **does not entail additional cost**.
- **Egress** (outbound private traffic from a container to resources within the same Private Network) will be routed through the private interface, but external traffic (from the Internet) will be through the public endpoint of the container.
- All DNS resolution is done through the Private Network (using the VPC DNS server `169.254.169.254`), which allows to resolve `*.internal` records.

## Quotas

Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/organizations-and-projects/additional-content/organization-quotas/) for more information on Private Networks quotas for Serverless Containers.

## Limitations

- VPC works with Namespaces that have **VPC support enabled**. VPC support can only be enabled at [namespace creation](/serverless-containers/how-to/create-manage-delete-containers-namespace/#creating-a-serverless-containers-namespace), and cannot be updated afterward.
- Only one Private Network can be attached to a container.
- **VPC routing** (custom routes and cross-PN automatic routing) is not supported yet.
- **Ingress** (inbound private traffic from resources to a container within the same Private Network) is not supported yet.
- Each [container instance](/serverless-containers/concepts/#instance) has a unique IP automatically assigned by Scaleway in the Private Network. This implies the following:
    - Users **cannot preemptively book an IP** with [IPAM](/ipam/), and reference it in the attachment.
    - A single Serverless Container can have a **large number of IPs** being used within the Private Network, depending on the number of concurrent instances.
    - **Cold-starts are slightly longer** due to the additional steps required to attach the node to the Private Network and book an IP.
