This page shows you how to configure your sending domain to start sending [transactional emails](/transactional-email/concepts/#transactional-email).

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A domain name


1. Click **Transactional Email** in the **Domains & Web Hosting** section of the [console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements) side menu. The **Transactional Email** overview page displays.
2. Click **Select a plan**. The Transactional Email creation wizard displays.
3. Select a plan. Two plans are available:
    - **Essential** - pay-as-you-go plan designed for occasional or low-volume email sending needs. This plan offers simplified management and a single webhook per domain.
    - **Scale** - fixed-price plan tailored for high-volume email sending. Includes 100K emails. Additional emails are charged. This plan includes a [dedicated IP address](/transactional-email/reference-content/tem-dedicated-ip) and unlimited webhooks per domain. It also features advanced blocklist management, allowing for manual additions.
    <Message type="important">
      When you select the **Scale plan**, keep in mind that:
        - A 30-day commitment is required to ensure a progressive and effective [warm-up of the IP address](/transactional-email/concepts#ip-warm-up).
        - 100K emails are included in the offer, with an additional cost of €0.20 for every 1000 additional emails
    </Message>
4. Click **Choose a plan and add a domain**.
5. Select whether to **Use a Scaleway domain** or **Add a domain external to Scaleway**. Follow the next steps according to your choice.

  <Message type="tip">
    When you use a domain name registered with [Scaleway Domains and DNS](/domains-and-dns/), you can benefit from DNS autoconfiguration. We can automatically configure SPF, DKIM, DMARC, MX on your behalf so your domain name can be validated automatically and you can focus on sending emails and observing the reputation status of your domain.
  </Message>
  1. Choose your existing Scaleway domain from the drop-down list.

      <Message type="important">
        If you do not have an active domain in your current Project, click **Register a domain** to [register a domain](/domains-and-dns/how-to/register-internal-domain/) with Scaleway Domains and DNS.
      </Message>

  2. Optionally, tick the checkbox **Add a domain prefix** to configure a subdomain for use with the Transactional Email service.

  <Message type="important">
    If your domain is registered with an external registrar, you can use it with the Transactional Email service by configuring the required DNS records manually. Validation time of domain ownership may be extended.
  </Message>

  1. Enter the domain name you want to use with Transactional Email.
  2. Click **Validate domain name**.
      <Message type="important">
      For external domains, you need to configure your [SPF](/transactional-email/concepts/#spf-record), [DKIM](/transactional-email/concepts/#dkim-record), [DMARC](/transactional-email/how-to/add-dmarc-record) and [MX](/transactional-email/concepts/#mx-record) records **manually** to verify your domain and to be able to send emails.
