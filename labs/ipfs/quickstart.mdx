IPFS is a protocol, made by [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/), for decentralized storage and content sharing.

You can leverage our IPFS Pinning service to permanently store your data on the public IPFS network. You can [create and manage your volumes](/labs/ipfs/api-cli/volumes-operations) and [Pins](/labs/ipfs/api-cli/ipfs-operations) from the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/login), via the [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/ipfs/) or via the [Scaleway Command Line Interface](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli).

<Message type="important">
- Data is **public**: our IPFS nodes are bootstrapped with public IPFS nodes. This implies that any pinned content will be **available on the public IPFS network**.
- Data is **shared**: public IPFS nodes can fetch and host your pinned content. Your data could be hosted **anywhere** from America, Asia and everything in between. Scaleway is not able to delete it once the content is delivered to external peers.
- Data is **not encrypted**: we **do not apply any encryption** algorithm to your data.

## Scaleway Command Line Interface Overview

[The Scaleway Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli) allows you to pilot your Scaleway infrastructure directly from your terminal, providing a faster way to administer and monitor your resources. Scaleway CLI is easy to set up and use, and an essential tool for operating efficiently in your cloud environment. The CLI provides many functionalities, including the ability to create and manage Volumes and Pins.

## How to create a volume

<Message type="important">
    To enable the IPFS command in the Scaleway CLI, you need to export the following environment variable: `export SCW_ENABLE_LABS=true`.
</Message>

A volume serves as a storage area for a set of pins. Think of it as Object Storage [buckets](/storage/object/concepts/#bucket).

Create your volume with the CLI:
```
SCW_ENABLE_LABS=true scw ipfs volume create project-id=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 name=my-volume
```

**Response**
```
ID         11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
ProjectID  00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
Region     fr-par
CountPin   0
CreatedAt  now
UpdatedAt  now
Name       my-volume
```

## How to pin a content from a CID

Now that we have a volume, we can pin content from [CIDs](/labs/ipfs/concepts/#content-identifier-(cid)) and URLs to it. Let's see how it works with a CID.

<Message type="note">
  The content pointed by the CID must already be present on the public IPFS network.
</Message>

<Message type="important">
    To enable the ipfs command in the Scaleway CLI, you need to export the following environment variable: 'export SCW_ENABLE_LABS=true'.
</Message>

1. Add content by CID.
  ```
  scw ipfs pin create-by-cid volume-id=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111 cid=QmQ6znATkFZdgniHofhFUSm3imBWN5yf5yiU5sLp56VRCu name=MyPinByCID
  ```
2. Check the status of your pin to see if the content is pinned at Scaleway.
  ```
  scw ipfs pin get pin-id=22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222 volume-id=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
  ```

**Response**
```
Status          pinned
CreatedAt       5 minutes ago
Cid.Cid         QmQ6znATkFZdgniHofhFUSm3imBWN5yf5yiU5sLp56VRCu
Cid.Name        value:"MyPinByCID"
```

## Retrieve your pinned content

Once your content is pinned on our service, you can fetch it via any compatible IPFS client connected to the public IPFS network ([Kubo](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/command-line/), or IPFS desktop).

If you installed Kubo, just do as follow:

```
ipfs get QmQ6znATkFZdgniHofhFUSm3imBWN5yf5yiU5sLp56VRCu
```

## How to unpin a content

If you no longer want to store a content, you can delete it by indicating the pin-id to remove.

<Message type="note">
  If you were the last owner of the content, it will be removed from Scaleway's storage.
</Message>

Delete a content by indicating the pin-id.
```
scw ipfs pin delete pin-id=22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222 volume-id=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
```

## How to delete a volume

It is possible to delete the entire volume, which removes all attached pins.

Delete volume storage.
```
scw ipfs volume delete volume-id=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
```
