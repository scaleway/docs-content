To add a new [resource](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#resource) to your Project, first ensure you are currently editing the correct Project. 

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />
 
<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) 
  - You have [added and validated a payment method](/console/my-account/how-to/manage-billing-information/#how-to-add-a-payment-method)
</Message>

1. Log into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) and click **Project Dashboard** in the side menu to check if you are logged in the correct Project. 
2. You can also check if the name of your Project appears in the **Selected Project** dropdown menu.

3. Select the resource you want to create from the console side menu.
4. Click the resource and follow deployment instructions. 

    Once the resource is created, it is automatically included in your Project. 

<Message type="note">
  It is currently not possible to transfer resources from one Project to another. For Object Storage, you can [import copies of your objects to buckets in different projects](/storage/object/api-cli/import-copy/).
