The **notification manager** allows you to configure different types of notifications about your Organization. It also provides shortcuts to your [Budget alerts](/console/billing/how-to/use-billing-alerts/), [Cockpit alerts](/observability/cockpit/how-to/enable-alert-manager/), and the Scaleway [status page](https://status.scaleway.com/).
