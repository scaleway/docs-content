In this quickstart, we show you how to create a [secret](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#secret/) within a [path](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#path/), and how to add [versions](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#version/) to your newly-created secret.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner/) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission/) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to create a secret

1. Click **Secret Manager** in the **Security and Identity** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu.
2. Click **+ Create secret**.
3. Choose the [region](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#region/) in which you want to store your secret.
    <Message type="important">
     Secrets cannot be moved from one region to another after creation.
    </Message>
4. Add your secret:
    - Choose whether to add your secret manually or import it from a file.
        <Message type="note">
         The maximum file size for your secret is 64 KiB.
        </Message>
    - Choose a [secret type](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#secret-type/) and enter or upload your secret value.
5. Choose a [path](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#path/) for your secret.
    <Message type="important">
      A [path](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#path/) is the directory structure to access your secrets and their [versions](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#version/). Each path **must be prefixed** with a slash.
    </Message>
6. Enter a name for your secret and add tags (optional).
7. Optionally, click <Icon name="toggle" /> to enable [secret protection](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#secret-protection/).
8. Optionally, click <Icon name="toggle" /> next to **Enable single access** or **Enable Time to Live** to apply an [ephemeral policy](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#ephemeral-policy/) to your secret and its versions.
    <Message type="important">
     - **Single access**: allows you to set your secret versions to **expire after one single access**.
     - **Time to Live**: allows you to set a time frame of up to one year, during which your secret versions are valid and accessible.
     - The ephemeral policy can only be applied to a secret at creation, and **cannot be removed** once applied.
     - Once applied to a secret, the ephemeral policy's settings will be applied to all the secret's versions (even those created subsequently).
    </Message>
9. Click **Create secret**. The **Overview** tab of your secret displays.

    <Message type="note">
      - You have created a secret on the go. The value of your secret is stored in its first version, which is [enabled](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#enabling-a-version/) by default. At creation, your secret only has one version. Keep reading our quickstart to find out how to add more versions to your secret.
    </Message>

## How to add a secret version

1. Click your secret's **Versions** tab.
2. Click **+ Create version**. A pop-up displays.
3. Add your version manually or import it from a file.
    <Message type="note">
      By default, all your secret versions have the same type as the secret they belong to. You cannot change the type after you have created the secret.
    </Message>
4. Enter or upload the new values.
5. Click the <Icon name="toggle" /> icon if you want to [enable](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#enabling-a-version/) the version.
6. Click **Create version**. Your secret versions display.
