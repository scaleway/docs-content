Scaleway's Kubernetes (K8s) Kapsule provides you with a managed environment to create, configure and run a cluster of pre-configured machines for containerized applications. You will be able to create clusters without the complexity of managing the infrastructure.

You can [create](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/) and [manage](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/edit-cluster/) your Kapsule clusters from the console, via the [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/kubernetes/) or via the [Scaleway Command Line Interface](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/).

## Scaleway command line interface overview

[The Scaleway command line interface (CLI)](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/) allows you to pilot your Scaleway infrastructure directly from your terminal, providing a faster way to administer and monitor your resources. Scaleway CLI is easy to set up and is an essential tool for operating efficiently in your cloud environment. The CLI provides many functionalities, including the ability to create and manage Kubernetes clusters.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
- Downloaded and installed the [Scaleway CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli#scaleway-cli-v2/)

## Configuring the CLI

1. Run the following command into your terminal to configure the Scaleway CLI on your machine:

    `scw init`

    If you have already configured the CLI, you will see a message like the following:

    ```
    Current config is located at /path/to/config.yaml
    access_key: <YOUR ACCESS KEY>
    secret_key: <YOUR SECRET KEY>
    default_organization_id: <YOUR ORGANIZATION ID>
    default_project_id: <YOUR PROJECT ID>
    default_region: <YOUR DEFAULT REGION, eg fr-par>
    default_zone: <YOUR DEFAULT ZONE, eg fr-par-1>

    Do you want to override the current config? (Y/n):
    ```
2. Type `n` and go directly to the [Creating a Kubernetes Kapsule cluster](#creating-a-k8s-kapsule-cluster) step of this tutorial, if you do not want to edit your configuration.

    If you have not yet configured the CLI, you will be guided through the configuration process via a series of questions:

    ```
    Enter a valid secret-key or an email
    ```
3. Enter either the email address for your account (you will then be asked for your password), or your [API secret key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/):
    ```
    To improve this tool we rely on diagnostic and usage data.
    Sending such data is optional and can be disabled at any time by running "scw config set send-telemetry=false".
    Do you want to send usage statistics and diagnostics? (Y/n):
    ```

    Type `y` or `n` and hit enter.

    ```
    To fully enjoy Scaleway CLI we recommend you install autocomplete support in your shell.
    Do you want to install autocomplete? (Y/n):
    ```
    Type `y` or `n` and hit enter.

    ```
    To enable autocomplete, scw needs to update your shell configuration.
    What type of shell are you using (default: zsh):
    ```

    Hit enter if the default shell type is already correct for you. Otherwise, enter your shell type and hit enter.

    ```
    To enable autocomplete we need to append to /Users/yourusername/.zshrc the following lines:
    # Scaleway CLI autocomplete initialization.
    eval "$(scw autocomplete script shell=zsh)"
    Do you want to proceed with these changes? (Y/n):
    ```
4. Type `y` or `n` and hit enter. This should complete the configuration process:
    ```
    Initialization completed with success.
    ```

## Creating a Kubernetes Kapsule cluster

1. Type the following command in your terminal to create a [Kubernetes Kapsule cluster](/containers/kubernetes/concepts/#cluster/):

    `scw k8s cluster create name=name-of-your-cluster`

    <Message type="tip">
      You can add the `type` argument to specify the cluster type. For an extensive list of the available cluster types, run the [list cluster types CLI command](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/blob/master/docs/commands/k8s.md#list-available-cluster-types-for-a-cluster/). If you do not specify a cluster type, a cluster of Kapsule type is created by default.<br /><br />

      It is possible to change the cluster type anytime. Depending on your current cluster type, the types you can change to vary. Refer to the [Changing the control plane offer](/containers/kubernetes/api-cli/changing-control-plane-offer) documentation page for more information.<br /><br />

      For more information about cluster types, refer to the [Kubernetes FAQ page](/faq/kubernetes/#can-i-choose-the-type-of-control-plane-for-my-cluster).

2. Write down the ID of your cluster, as you will need it in the next steps.

## Installing a KubeConfig configuration file

Type the following command in your terminal and replace `your-cluster-ID` with the ID of your previously generated cluster:

`scw k8s kubeconfig install your-cluster-ID`

You will see the following output:

```
Kubeconfig for cluster your-cluster-ID successfully written at /Users/yourusername/.kube/config
```

## Adding a pool to a Kubernetes cluster

A pool is a set of identical nodes. A pool has a name, a size (its current number of nodes), nodes number limits (min and max), and a Scaleway Instance type.

<Message type="note">
  Instance type with insufficient memory are not eligible to become nodes (DEV1-S, PLAY2-PICO, STARDUST)
</Message>

Changing these limits increases/decreases the size of a pool. Thus, when autoscaling is enabled, the pool will grow or shrink inside those limits, depending on its load.

<Message type="note">
  For more information about pools, refer to the [Scaleway CLI documentation](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/blob/master/docs/commands/k8s.md/#kapsule-pool-management-commands/).
</Message>


Type the following command in your terminal:

`scw k8s pool create cluster-id=id-of-your-cluster name=name-of-your-pool node-type=GP1_XS size=number-of-nodes-wanted`

You will see an output similar to this:

```

Type the following command in your terminal and replace `your-pool-ID` with the pool ID you want to delete:

`scw k8s pool delete your-pool-ID`

You will see an output similar to this:

## Uninstalling a Kubeconfig from a specific cluster


Type the following command in your terminal and replace `your-cluster-ID` with the cluster ID you want to delete the Kubeconfig from:

`scw k8s kubeconfig uninstall your-cluster-ID`

You will get an output similar to this:

```
Cluster your-cluster-ID successfully deleted from /Users/yourusername/.kube/config
