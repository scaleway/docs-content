To ensure the security of your Scaleway Dedibox account, it is strongly advised that you regularly verify and update your contact details, especially your email address. This precautionary measure helps prevent any potential account lockouts if you lose access to both your console password and email account.

In the unlikely event you encounter such a situation, the following procedure outlines the steps to recover access to your Scaleway Dedibox account.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)

If you cannot access your email account, send us a contact update request, including the following details:

* Your current and new email addresses,
* Your postal address,
* Two distinct identity documents (such as your passport or local ID card, for individual accounts, and incorporation certificate, for companies),
* A reachable phone number for contact purposes,
* A copy of your most recent Scaleway Dedibox invoice. If you do not have it, you can provide the amount charged.
* A card statement displaying the Scaleway bill debit.

Submit the complete set of required documents, via email, to [document@scaleway.com](mailto:document@scaleway.com).

Upon receiving your application, we will proceed with updating your email address, subject to validation.

Once your email address is updated, you submit a [lost password form](https://console.online.net/en/user/recovery) to request the recovery codes for your account.
