<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net)
  - You have created a **Webhosting Classic**
</Message>

Email filters allow you to sort your emails depending on different criteria such as the sender, the subject, etc. If the email meets one or more criteria, you can define different actions such as deleting the email, moving it into a folder, etc. Email filters only work on email accounts.

## How to configure your email filters? 

1. Log into your [Scaleway webmail](https://webmail.online.net/) account.
2. Click **Settings** on the upper right corner of your screen, then click **Filters**. You can create filter groups, and activate or deactivate your filters by groups to easily manage your emails. 
    
    <Message type="important">
    - You need to know if there is a filter active. If you activate another filter group the previous one will be disabled. 
    - We recommend you name your filter group different than "console" because this name is used for default filters.
