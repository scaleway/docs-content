When hosting healthcare data using Scaleway Block Storage, you must follow the recommendations outlined in the [shared responsibility model](/block-storage/reference-content/storage-shared-responsibility-model/) to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, such as data protection laws, and industry standards.

Adhering to these guidelines helps safeguard sensitive information against unauthorized access, breaches, and data loss, while also clarifying the roles and responsibilities between the cloud provider and the customer.

This documentation provides the following elements:

- A procedure to create a compliant volume
- Information on prohibited actions
- Compliant encryption methods
- Compliant deletion methods
- A checklist to ensure you are ready to safely store healthcare data

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Signed an HDS contract with Scaleway for the garantees outlined in the [shared responsibility model](/block-storage/reference-content/storage-shared-responsibility-model/) to apply

## How to create a compliant volume

Even though you can use an existing volume to host healthcare data, we strongly recommend you create a dedicated volume for this purpose.

## Prohibited actions on a compliant volume

to host healthcare data, you must comply to the following requirements:

<Message type="important">
Failure to comply with these requirements may lead to voiding compliance on the objects contained in the bucket.
</Message>

## How to encrypt data



## How to delete objects

data must be deleted in a compliant way to make sure data can not be retrieved by any means immediately afterward.

This mechanism guarantees your objects can not be immediately retrieved, even if it takes additionnal time to process the delete of all the remaining chunks of your deleted objects.

## Compliant bucket creation checklist

Make sure that your bucket follows the requirements below:

1. Make sure you [created your volume](#how-to-create-a-compliant-volume) in the **France - Paris** (`fr-par`) region.



7. Follow the provided security best practices at all times.

Refer to the [Block Storage Shared Responsibility Model](/block-storage/reference-content/storage-shared-responsibility-model/) for comprehensive information on the legal framework to host healthcare data.
