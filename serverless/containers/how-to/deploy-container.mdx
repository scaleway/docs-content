This page shows you how to deploy Serverless Containers using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/).

You can deploy a container from the [Scaleway Container Registry](/containers/container-registry/quickstart/), or any other public container registry, such as Docker Hub, AWS Container registries, GitLab container registry, etc.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a containers namespace](/serverless/containers/how-to/create-manage-delete-containers-namespace/)
- [Created a Container Registry namespace](/containers/container-registry/how-to/create-namespace/) and [pushed a container image](/containers/container-registry/how-to/push-images/) to it

## Deploy from the Scaleway Container Registry

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The containers page displays.
2. Click the relevant container's namespace.
3. Click **Deploy container**. The container creation wizard displays.
4. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Select the **Scaleway** Container Registry.
    - Choose an [image](/serverless/containers/concepts/#container-image) from your Container Registry. 
    - Select the required Container Registry namespace from the drop-down list, and then select the container and tag.
    - Choose the [port](/serverless/containers/concepts/#port) your container is listening on. We recommend configuring your container to listen on the `$PORT` environment variable.
    - Choose a **name** for your container and, optionally, a **description**. The name must only contain alphanumeric characters and dashes.
    - Choose the **resources** to be allocated to your container at runtime. These define the performance characteristics of your container.
        <Message type="note">
        Available memory depends on allocated vCPU, and the maximum ephemeral storage value depends on allocated memory.
        </Message>
    - Set your [scaling](/serverless/containers/concepts/#scaling) preferences, or leave them at default values. The Scaleway platform automatically scales the number of available instances of your container to match the incoming load, depending on the settings you define here.
    - Click **Advanced options** to define any [environment variables](/serverless/containers/concepts/#environment-variables) you want to inject into your container. For each environment variable, click **+Add variable** and enter the key/value pair.
    - Add [secrets](/serverless/containers/concepts/#secrets) for your container. Secrets are environment variables that are injected into your container, but the values are not retained or displayed by Scaleway after initial validation.
        <Message type="note">
        Encode your environment variables and secrets to `base64` if they are too large, and contain carriage returns.
        </Message>
    - Set the desired [privacy policy](/serverless/containers/concepts/#privacy-policy) for your container. This defines whether container invocation may be done anonymously (**public**) or only via an authentication mechanism provided by the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-containers/#authentication) (**private**).
    - Set a custom [timeout](/serverless/containers/concepts/#timeout) for your container.
    - Verify the **estimated cost**.
5. Click **Deploy container** to finish.

## Deploy from an external container registry

Scaleway Serverless Containers allows you to deploy containers from external public [container registries](/containers/container-registry/concepts/#registry), such as Docker Hub, AWS container registries, GitLab container registry, etc.

Private external container registries are currently not supported.

3. Click **Deploy container**. The container creation wizard displays.
4. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Select the **External** container registry.
    - Enter the public container **image URL** provided by the external registry. For example:
      - `nginx:latest` to deploy the latest nginx image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
      - `ghcr.io/namespace/image` to deploy an image from [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/features/packages)
