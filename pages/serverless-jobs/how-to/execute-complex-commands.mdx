Scaleway Serverless Jobs allows you to execute specific startup commands when running a job. Due to technical specifications, complex commands (e.g. piped commands, `xargs` commands) may fail occasionally, preventing jobs from running successfully.

You can bypass this limitation by passing complex commands and scripts to a Serverless Job via a [secret reference](/serverless-jobs/concepts/#secrets-reference). You can then inject this secret as a file in your job, and call it at startup to execute the commands it contains.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- created a [Serverless Job](/serverless-jobs/how-to/create-job/)

## How to create a secret containing your command

1. Click **Secret Manager** in the **Security & Identity** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu.

2. In the **Region** drop-down, select the [region](/secret-manager/concepts/#region) in which you want to store your secret. Secrets cannot be moved from one region to another after creation.

3. Click **+ Create secret**.

4.  Select **Import secret**, choose the **Opaque** secret type, then drag and drop your file to the dedicated area. The maximum file size for your secret is 64 KiB.

5. Choose the **Scaleway-managed encryption key**, as it requires no configuration on your side.

6. Choose a [path](/secret-manager/concepts/#path) for your secret.

7. Enter a name for your secret, and, optionally, add a description and tags.
      
8. Click **Create secret** to confirm.

Your file can now be passed to your Serverless Job as a secret reference.
