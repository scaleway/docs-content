Function as a Service allows developers to run code without the hassle of managing the server/instance running it.

IoT Hub allows messages to be exchanged between devices and business-specific software. Some or all components of this software can be implemented using Function as a Service, and IoT Hub can be configured to trigger these functions to process messages being exchanged on the Hub.

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created a function](/compute/functions/how-to/create-a-function/)
  - You have [created an IoT Hub](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/create-hub/) and [added a Device](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/add-device/)

</Message>

## How to set up a Route to a Function

1. Instruct your IoT Hub to trigger your function when a message is published on the `my/super/topic` topic. To do so we will use an IoT Hub REST Route.

2. Click the Routes tab of your IoT Hub. 

3. Create a new route with the following settings:

    - Name: any name you want
    - Topic: `my/super/topic`
    - Route type: REST Query
    - Method: `POST`
    - Endpoint: the Function endpoint you got earlier
    - HTTP Headers: leave empty

In a typical use-case, the same Function will be used for many topics. It is possible to achieve this by using MQTT wildcards in the Route topic. You can then rely on the `X-Mqtt-Topic` HTTP header in your Serverless Function for your topic-based processing. Please see [this blog post](https://blog.scaleway.com/2020/scaleway-iot-hub-introduction-to-mqtt-topics/) for more information about MQTT topics.

## How to trigger the Function

1. Click the `MQTT Webclient` button on your device information page. The client will open and automatically connect.

2. Publish a message to the `my/super/topic` topic. In the `Publish` block:
    - Write `my/super/topic` as the topic
    - Leave QoS as 0
    - Leave Retain unticked
    - Write `Hello World !` as the message
    - Click `Publish` (no confirmation will be issued)

  You can see your published message in the function logs. 
  
  <Message type="note">

    There may be a few minutes delay before the logs show up.

  </Message>

## How to reply to a message

In many cases, your Function will want to publish a message to react to the received message.

To allow this action, add an `X-Mqtt-Topic` header to your reply, and a new message will be published on your IoT Hub under the topic. 

The content of the message will be the body of the reply. 

<Message type="important">

  The HTTP status code needs to be in the 2xx range.

</Message>


## How to use private Functions

If you require authentication to protect your Serverless Function, here is how to do it:

1. Click the settings tab of your function settings tab and tick the `Private` option.

2. [Generate a token](/compute/functions/api-cli/restricting-access-to-a-function) for your function.

3. Re-create your IoT Hub Route with the following HTTP header: `SCW_FUNCTIONS_TOKEN: <function token here>`.

Your Function is now private and still accessible from IoT Hub!
