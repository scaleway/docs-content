## BF16

BF16, or Brain Floating Point 16, is a numerical format optimized for neural network computations. 
It strikes a balance between range and precision, making it efficient for deep learning tasks while maintaining accuracy.
BF16 uses 1 bit for the sign, 8 bits for the exponent, and 7 bits for the mantissa (fractional part). This format provides a wider range than IEEE 754 half-precision (FP16) while still maintaining better precision than integer formats. 
It was introduced to address the limitations of FP16 for deep learning tasks, offering improved efficiency and accuracy for training and running neural network models.

## Moore's Law

Moore's law, originally observed by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965, describes a consistent trend wherein the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits doubles every year since their inception.
However, over the past decade, Moore's law has shown signs of deceleration, mainly due to the rapid advancement of GPU architectures, which have outpaced the rate of CPU performance-per-watt growth.

## Scratch storage

Scratch storage refers to a type of temporary storage space used in computing systems, particularly in high-performance computing (HPC) environments and supercomputers. 
It is used for short-term cache storage of data that is being actively processed, but it is not meant for long-term or permanent storage.
Scratch storage is an ephemeral storage solution that does not support features like snapshots, backups, or restores.

<Message type="note">
  Scratch storage does not survive once the server is stopped: doing a full stop/start cycle will erase the scratch data. However, doing a simple reboot or using the stop in place function will keep the data.

## Structural sparsity

Modern AI networks are characterized by their substantial size, as they contain millions or even billions of parameters.
However, not all these parameters are indispensable for precise predictions, and certain ones of these parameters can be transformed into zeros, resulting in "sparse" models that maintain accuracy.
Although the sparsity feature in the A100 and H100 GPUs primarily enhances AI inference, it also contributes to improved model training performance.
