The **Scaleway Operator** is a Kubernetes controller that lets you create Scaleway Resources directly from Kubernetes via [Kubernetes Custom Resources Definitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/).

<Message type="important">

This project is under active development and should be considered alpha.

## Features

Currently, **Scaleway Operator** only supports RDB instances, databases and users. Other resources will be implemented, and [contributions](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-operator/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) are more than welcome!

If you want to see a specific Scaleway product, please [open an issue](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-operator/issues/new) describing which product you would like to see.

## Getting Started

1. Install [Cert Manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/) in order to handle the webhooks certificates.

  ```bash
  $ kubectl apply --validate=false -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.0.3/cert-manager.yaml
  ```

2. Once Cert Manager is up and running, you have to install the CRDs. First clone the repo, and then making sure your `KUBECONFIG` environment variable is set on the right cluster, run:

  ```bash
  $ make install
  ```

3. Then, run:

  ```bash
  kubectl create -f deploy/scaleway-operator-secrets.yml --edit --namespace=scaleway-operator-system
  ```

  and replace the values.

4. In order to deploy the Scaleway Operator, run:

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -k config/default
  ```
