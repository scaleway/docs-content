## What is Scaleway Queues?

Scaleway Queues is a product for creating managed message queues, using an in-house implementation of AWS SQS protocol. Queues allows you to implement your message queues without the hassle of managing the infrastructure, scaling or updates. Message queues are ideal for facilitating asynchronous job processing and communication between microservices.

## What is SQS?

**S**imple **Q**ueue **S**ervice, or SQS, is AWS's distributed message [queuing](#queuing) service, that supports programmatic sending of messages via web service applications. It became generally available in 2006, and is a highly scalable queuing service that facilitates the decoupling of software systems. 

## What is the relationship between Scaleway Queues and AWS SQS?

Scaleway has developed its own service based on AWS SQS protocol. Queues does not have any dependencies on the AWS SQS infrastructure or offering, we use our own stack which is fully self-hosted and developed in-house.

Scaleway Queues provides a gateway that enables you to connect any existing SQS-connected applications without having to significantly modify your code baseline.

  Some SQS features are not yet supported. Refer to our [dedicated documentation page](/queues/reference-content/queues-support/) for more information.

## Credentials

You must [create credentials](/queues/how-to/create-credentials/) to give your applications permission to connect to the Scaleway Queues service.

Credentials are scoped to your Scaleway Queues service at [Project](/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project)-level. You can choose to give each set of credentials the required level of permissions:

  - **Read**: receive messages from queues and topics.
  - **Write**: send messages to queues and publish in topics.
  - **Manage**: create or edit resources (such as queues and topics).

## Creating queues

You can [create queues](/queues/how-to/create-manage-queues/) via the Scaleway console. You can choose to create either a Standard or FIFO queue, and tweak parameters such as visibility timeout, message retention period, maximum message size and content based deduplication.

## Further actions

All further actions such as sending messages can be done using the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs. Check out our documentation to help you get started with the [AWS CLI](/queues/api-cli/connect-aws-cli/) or [AWS SDKs](/queues/api-cli/python-node-queues/).
