## Gitlab - Overview

[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) is an open-core Git-repository manager providing a Wiki, Issue-Tracking and CI/CD pipeline features. Open-core means that the core functionalities of the software are released under an open-source licence with added optional modules.
The tool is used by many large technology companies to manage their software development life cycle. The tool was initially developed in Ruby and uses in the current technology stack also Go and Vue.js.

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)  
- You have [configured your SSH Key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- You have a Virtual Cloud Instance or Bare Metal Server running on Ubuntu Bionic Beaver (18.04)
- You have a domain or subdomain configured to point to the IP address of your Instance
- You have [enabled the SMTP ports](https://www.scaleway.com/en/faq/why-can-i-not-send-any-email/) to be able to send emails from your Instance

</Message>

## Installing GitLab

1. Connect yourself to your instance using [SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/)
  ```
  ssh root@<your_instance_ip>
  ```

2. Update the `apt` packet cache and upgrade the software already installed on the instance:
  ```
  apt update && apt upgrade -y
  ```

3. Install the following packages using `apt`:
  ```
  apt install -y curl ca-certificates postfix
  ```

4. Add the GitLab package repository and prepare the installation of GitLab Community Edition by running the script:
  ```
  curl https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ce/script.deb.sh | bash
  ```

5. Set configure your domain name in the `EXTERNAL_URL` variable, then install GitLab using `apt`:
  ```
  EXTERNAL_URL="https://gitlab.example.com" apt install -y gitlab-ce
  ```

  <Message type="important">

  GitLab will automatically request a [Let's Encrypt](/tutorials/configure-nginx-letsencrypt/) certifcate for your domain name. Make sure you have pointed the `A-Record` of your domain to your instances IP address to be able to obtain a valid certificate.

## Configuring the GitLab Database

To configure GitLab with your Scaleway Elements Datatabase Instance, you need to configure the database from your [Console](https://console.scaleway.com) in a first step:

- Enter the [Database section](https://console.scaleway.com/rdb/instances) of the console and select your Database Instance.
- Click the **Databases** tab, then on **Create Database**.
- Enter the database name (`gitlab_production`) and confirm by clicking on **Create Database**.
- Click the **Users** tab, then on **Add User**.
- Enter the username (`gitlab`) and a secure password. In the permission tab give `ALL` permissions for the user on the `gitlab_production` database.
- Retrieve the Database Instance **IP address** and **Port** as they will be required for the following steps:

1. Open the file `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` in your favourite text editor (For example `nano` or `vim`).

2. Add the following parameters in the Gitlab configuration file:
    ```
    # Disable the built-in Postgres server
    postgresql['enable'] = false

    # Connection details of the Scaleway Elements Database
    gitlab_rails['db_adapter'] = 'postgresql'
    gitlab_rails['db_encoding'] = 'utf8'
    gitlab_rails['db_database'] = '<SCALEWAY_DATABASE_BASE>'
    gitlab_rails['db_host'] = '<SCALEWAY_DATABASE_IP>'
    gitlab_rails['db_port'] = '<SCALEWAY_DATABASE_PORT>'
    gitlab_rails['db_username'] = '<SCALEWAY_DATABASE_USERNAME>'
    gitlab_rails['db_password'] = '<SCALEWAY_DATABASE_PASSWORD>'
    ```
    Replace the following values in the configuration:
    - `<SCALEWAY_DATABASE_BASE>`: The name of your Scaleway Elements Database. It is recommended to use a name like `gitlab_production`
    - `<SCALEWAY_DATABASE_IP>`: The IP address of your Scaleway Elements Database Instance
    - `<SCALEWAY_DATABASE_PORT>`: The port of your Scaleway Elements Database Instance
    - `<SCALEWAY_DATABASE_USERNAME>`: Your Scaleway Elements Database user
    - `<SCALEWAY_DATABASE_PASSWORD>`: Password of your Scaleway Elements Database user

3. Once modified save the file and exit the text editor.

4. Reconfigure GitLab:
  ```
  gitlab-ctl reconfigure
  ```

5.  Seed the GitLab database:
  <Message type="important">
  
  This command overwrites your GitLab database. Be carefully when using it. You will lose any previous data stored in the database.
  
  </Message>

  ```
  DISABLE_DATABASE_ENVIRONMENT_CHECK=1 gitlab-rake gitlab:setup
  ```

6. Confirm the database seed by typing `yes` when prompted.

## Logging into GitLab

1. Open your web browser and go to your Gitlab URL (for example: `https://gitlab.example.com`)

2. Configure a password for your first user.

3. Login using the user `root` and the password you have defined previously.

4. The GitLab Dashboard displays. You can now configure your GitLab installation, add additional users and repositories. All data is stored securely on your Scaleway Elements Database Instance:
