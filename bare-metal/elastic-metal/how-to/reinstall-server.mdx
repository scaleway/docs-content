An Elastic Metal server can be reinstalled at any time from the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com). This can be useful when you want to run a different image on the machine or if you want to have a fresh installation.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)  
  - You have [configured your SSH key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key)
  - You have [created](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/create-server) and [installed](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/install-server) an Elastic Metal server

  Be careful when using this feature. Reinstalling your server erases the disk
  and all data on the disk will be lost. Make sure to have a backup before
  reinstalling your server.

1. Click **Elastic Metal** in the **Bare Metal** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Elastic Metal dashboard displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the server you want to reinstall. A drop-down menu displays.
3. Click **Reinstall** in the menu to enter the installation wizard.
4. Choose the operating system that you want to install on the machine.
5. Add your [SSH key](/console/my-account/concepts/#ssh-key). If you have already [uploaded a key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/#how-to-upload-the-public-ssh-key-to-the-scaleway-interface), it displays in the list of keys. Choose the keys to grant access to the server by ticking or unticking the corresponding checkbox.
6. Click **Reinstall server** to launch the installation. It will take about 10 minutes to complete.
