Managed MongoDB® Databases provide fully-managed document Database Instances, with MongoDB® as a database engine.

Document databases enable users to store and retrieve data in a document format, such as `json`. Compared to traditional relational databases where data is stored in a table-like format, document-type storage supports storing multiple nested keys and values in each document key.

## How to create a database

1. Click **MongoDB®** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu, if you do not have a Database Instance already created, the creation page displays.
2. Click **Create a Database Instance**. The creation wizard displays.
3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Select **MongoDB®** as a database engine.
    - Choose a region. This is the geographical location where your database will be deployed.
    - Select a replica set configuration. You can choose between:
        - **Replica-set 1-node** - an instance of MongoDB® that runs as a single server and does not provide redundancy or high availability.
        - **Replica-set 3-nodes** - a group of 3 MongoDB® servers (1 primary and 2 standby nodes) that maintain the same data set. Replica sets provide redundancy and high availability and are the basis for all production deployments. If the main node fails for any reason, one of the remaining standby nodes is assigned and can take over requests, reducing downtime.
    - Select a node type.
    - Define the size of your Block Storage volume. You can increase your storage space without changing your node type, with no downtime. You can increase your volume size to up to 10 TB.
    - Add a name and set a password for your user.
