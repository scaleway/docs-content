You can leverage our IPFS pinning service to store permanently your data on the public IPFS network. You can do it via a CID (Content-ID) or an URL. You can [create](/storage/ipfs/api-cli/volumes-operations) and manage your volume via the [IPFS Command Line Interface](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo) and the [IPFS Desktop](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop/).
