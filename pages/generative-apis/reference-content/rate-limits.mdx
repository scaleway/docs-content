## What are the limits?

Any model served through Scaleway Generative APIs gets limited by:
- Tokens per minute
- Queries per minute

<Message type="tip">
These limits only apply if you created a Scaleway Account and registered a valid payment method. Otherwise, stricter limits apply to ensure usage stays within Free Tier only.

## How can I increase the rate limits?

We actively monitor usage and will improve rates based on feedback.
If you need to increase your rate limits, [contact our support team](https://console.scaleway.com/support/create), providing details on the model used and specific use case.
Note that for increases of up to x5 or x10 volumes, we highly recommend using dedicated deployments with [Managed Inference](https://console.scaleway.com/inference/deployments), which provides exactly the same features and API compatibility.

## Why do we set rate limits?

These limits safeguard against abuse or misuse of Scaleway Generative APIs, helping to ensure fair access to the API with consistent performance.
