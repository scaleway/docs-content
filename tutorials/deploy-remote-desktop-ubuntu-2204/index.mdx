## Remote Desktop - Overview

A cloud instance can be used with third party software to run a remote desktop. The software captures the Instance's screen and transmits it to another device, where the user can interact with the remote machine using its local keyboard and mouse. 

A remote desktop can be useful for tasks such as:
* access to a remote computer from anywhere 
* editing and sharing files between other machines using a high-speed 9nternet connection
* perform admistrative tasks
* perform live demonstations of applications installed on the remote machine

In this tutorial you learn deploying a remote desktop on a Instance running on Ubuntu Jammy Jellyfish (22.04 LTS) by using the following stack: 
* [xRDP](http://xrdp.org/) - an open-source alternative to Microsoft RDP (Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol).
* [xfce](https://xfce.org/) - a lightweight and stable desktop environment 


<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have [configured your SSH Key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- You have an Instance running on Ubuntu Jammy Jellyfish (22.04 LTS)
- You have sudo privileges or access to the root user

## Preparing the remote machine

1. Connect to your Instance using `ssh`:

  ```
  ssh root@<your_instance_ip>
  ```

2. Update the `apt` sources list and upgrade the software already installed on the instance:

  ```
  apt update && apt upgrade -y
  ```

3. Install the required packages for the desktop environment using the `apt` package manager:

  ```
  apt install xorg xfce4 xfce4-goodies dbus-x11 x11-xserver-utils
  ```

4. The xRDP server binary is available in the default Ubuntu repositories and it can be installed using `apt`. The following command installs the packages `xrdp` and `ufw`, a firewall to protect your Instance from unauthorized access:

  ```
  apt install xrdp ufw
  ```

5. The package manager configures the service to be automatically started upon system reboot. Run the following command to check that the service has been started during the installation:

  ```
  systemctl status xrdp
  ```

  A message like the following displays, confirming the status `active (running)`:

  ```
  ‚óè xrdp.service - xrdp daemon
       Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/xrdp.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
       Active: active (running) since Fri 2022-05-06 14:40:08 UTC; 47s ago
  ```

  In case the service has not been started automatically, start it with `systemctl`:

  ```
  systemctl start xrdp
  ```

6. Open the xRDP configuration file in a text editor of your choice, for example `nano`:

  ```
  nano /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini
  ```

5. Scroll to the bottom of the file and add the following line, then save the file and exit the text editor:

  ```
  exec startxfce4
  ```

6. Restart the xrdp service using `systemctl` to activate the new configuration:

  ```
  systemctl restart xrdp
  ```

## Configuring the firewally

1. Restrict the access to port `3389` to an IP address or a range of IPs. To allow access from the block `192.168.1.0/24` launch the following command:

  ```
  ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 3389
  ```

  To allow connections from any host run the following command:

  ```
  ufw allow 3389
  ```

  Exposing the service to any IP may cause a security issue.

  </Message>

2. Enable the firewall:

  ```
  ufw enable
  ```

  For more information on how to configure the firewall of your Instance, you can [read our tutorial about the configuration of ufw on Ubuntu](/tutorials/installation-uncomplicated-firewall/).

## Configuring a regular user

It is recommended to create a regular user to connect to the remote desktop, to avoid security issues.

1. Add the user with the `adduser` command:

  ```
  adduser <myuser>
  ```

2. (Optionally) If you want to give superuser rights to the user, install sudo using the `apt` package manager:

  ```
  apt install sudo
  ```

3. (Optionally) Add the user to the sudoers file:

  ```
  adduser <myuser> sudo
  ```

## Connecting to the remote desktop

1. Download and install a RDP client of your choice. We will use the [Microsoft Remote Desktop Client](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-clients) in this tutorial.

2. Start the RDP client and click **Add Desktop** to add a new connection :

3. Enter the connection details. You need to enter at least your Instances IP in the **PC name**. Optionally you can add a **Friendly Name** to facilitate the identification of your instance in case you configure several RDP connections.

4. Double click the connection icon. During the first connection, you may be asked to validate the fingerprint of the instance. Click **OK** to confirm the connection.

5. Enter the identifier and password of your regular user when prompted.

6. You are now connected and the remote desktop of your Ubuntu Jammy Jellyfish (22.04 LTS) Instance displays. You can launch applications on the remote machine, as you would do locally.
