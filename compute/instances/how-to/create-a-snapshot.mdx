The snapshot feature allows you to create an image of a specific [volume](/compute/instances/concepts/#volumes) of your Instance. A snapshot is a full-volume copy stored in our secure data centers. They are usually used to recover volume data or to create a copy of a volume.

Several options are available to create snapshots from your Instance:

* **LSSD (Local storage):** This snapshot type can be created from local volumes. LSSD snapshots can be converted to local volumes only.
* **BSSD (Block storage):** This snapshot type can be created from block volumes. BSSD snapshots can be converted to block volumes only.
* **Unified:** This snapshot type can be created from either local or block volumes. Unified snapshots can be converted into either LSSD or BSSD volumes.

  The snapshot feature creates backups of specific volumes only. If you wish to create a backup image that is a complete backup of your Instance including **all** of its volumes, check out our documentation on [how to create an image](/compute/instances/how-to/create-a-backup).

3. Click the **+ Create snapshot** button. You are directed to the snapshot creation wizard.
4. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Choose a **name** for the snapshot, or use the default suggested name.
    - Select the **volume** you wish to snapshot. All of your Instances' volumes will be shown on the drop-down list, grouped by Availability Zone.
    - Select the **snapshot type**. The available types of snapshots depend on your volume type and can either be LSSD, BSSD, or Unified.
    - Check the **Estimated cost**.
5. Click **Create snapshot** to finish. You are redirected to the **Snapshots** tab, where your new snapshot now appears in the list.

## How to create a volume from a snapshot

You can create a [volume](/compute/instances/concepts/#volume) from a snapshot as follows:

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The [Instances page](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) displays.
2. Click the **Snapshots** tab.
3. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the snapshot you want to create an image from. A drop-down menu displays.
4. Click **Volume from snapshot**. A pop-up displays.

5. Enter a name for the volume (or use the default suggested name), select the volume type, and click **Create volume from Snapshot**.
    <Message type="note">
      The available volume types may change according to the type of snapshot you select.
    </Message>

    The volume is created, and can be viewed in the [Volumes tab](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/volumes). Check out our documentation on [attaching volumes](/storage/block/how-to/attach-a-volume) and [mounting volumes](/storage/block/api-cli/managing-a-volume/#mounting-the-block-volume) to learn how to use the volume with your Instances.

## How to create an Instance from a snapshot

Follow the instructions for [creating an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance). At the **Choose an image** step of the creation wizard, click the **My snapshots** tab, and select the desired snapshot.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-create-from-snapshot.webp" alt="" />

You can see the snapshotted volume in the Instance's volumes at **step 4** of the creation wizard.
