By default, the SMTP ports (25, 465, 587) for outgoing emails on your Elastic Metal server are closed and cannot be reached from our infrastructure.

If you want to send emails from your server, you can enable SMTP for each Availability Zone from the console.

<Requirements />
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [installed Elastic Metal server](/elastic-metal/quickstart/#how-to-create-an-elastic-metal-server)
- [Verified your identity](/account/how-to/verify-identity/)

<Message type="tip">
  This guide explains how to enable SMTP on Elastic Metal servers. If you need to enable SMTP on other resources, refer to our documentation on [how to send emails from your Instance](/instances/how-to/send-emails-from-your-instance/) and [how to enable SMTP on Public Gateways](/public-gateways/how-to/configure-a-public-gateway/#how-to-enable-smtp).
