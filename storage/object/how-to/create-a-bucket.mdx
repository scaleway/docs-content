Object Storage allows you to store different types of objects (documents, images, videos, etc.) and to distribute them instantly, anywhere in the world.

To get started with Object Storage, you must first create a bucket. Objects are gathered into buckets. Each bucket represents a space where objects are stored.

1. Click **Object Storage** on the left side menu of the console. The Object Storage dashboard displays.
2. Click **+ Create a bucket**. The bucket creation page displays.

3. Enter a name for your bucket. The bucket name is used as a unique identifier which allows us to provide features such as the bucket location and geo-replication.

  The bucket name must:
    - be unique 
    - contain only alphanumeric and lowercase characters

  Learn more about bucket name limitations on our [dedicated FAQ page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/faq/is-there-a-limitation-in-the-bucket-name/).

4. Select the geographical location in which your bucket will be created. Scaleway Object Storage is currently available in three Availability Zones (AZ/Region).
    - Amsterdam, The Netherlands: 
      - Region: `nl-ams`
    - Paris, France: 
      - Region: `fr-par`
    - Warsaw, Poland: 
      - Region: `pl-waw`
5. Check **Public** or **Private** to define the bucket visibility. The bucket visibility specifies whether everyone can see the list of objects in the bucket or not. It does not affect [object visibility](/storage/object/how-to/manage-object-visibility/). You can change the visibility settings at a later time in the Object Storage dashboard.
  <Message type="note">

  A file uploaded to a public bucket is private by default.
  A private file in a public bucket cannot be accessed publicly.
  You can change the visibility settings at any time from the Object Storage bucket dashboard.

6. Verify that all information about your bucket is correct in the summary before clicking **Create a bucket** to confirm. A list of your buckets displays, showing the newly created bucket.

You can find more information about your bucket by clicking on its name in the **buckets list** and then on the **Bucket Settings** tab.
