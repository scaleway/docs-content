Scaleway offers a range of ready-to-use AI Docker images. These Docker images can be used with all GPU Instance OS images.

You can pull the images from our container registry as follows:

```sh
docker pull rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/scw-ai/<IMAGE:TAG>
```

Our tag names follow the pattern `:YYMM-py3`, where `YY` and `MM` refer to the year and month the image was built. One exception to this is the tag used for the Tensorflow image, which is `:YYMM-tf2-py3`.

The latest images are also tagged with the `:latest` tag.

Initial tags will start with 2204-py3 (April 2022). Check out the [Scaleway Changelog](https://www.scaleway.com/en/changelog/) to be informed of Docker AI images updates.

All our images are based on CUDA 11.2 and cuDNN8

When using the “Ubuntu Focal GPU OS11” image with your Instance, you can omit the *nvidia runtime* option

The following commands show how to launch a container based on each of our various Docker images:

 ## Tensorflow

```sh
docker run --runtime=nvidia -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/scw-ai/tensorflow:latest /bin/bash
```

The main libraries included in the Tensorflow image are: Tensorflow 2.x, Tensorboard, Autokeras, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Optuna, Pillow, Plotly, ONNX, Spacy, HuggingFace Transformers and HuggingFace-Hub, JupyterLab and jupyterlab-nvdashboard.

 ## Pytorch

```sh
docker run --runtime=nvidia -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/scw-ai/pytorch:latest /bin/bash
```

The main libraries included  in the Pytorch image are: Pytorch, Tensorboard, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Optuna, Pillow, Plotly, ONNX, Spacy, HuggingFace Transformers and HuggingFace-Hub, JupyterLab and jupyterlab-nvdashboard.


 ## Jax

```sh
docker run --runtime=nvidia -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/scw-ai/jax:latest /bin/bash
```

 ## RAPIDS

Note: This image is built on top of the official RAPIDS docker image

```sh
docker run --runtime=nvidia -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/scw-ai/rapids:latest /bin/bash

```

The main libraries included in the RAPIDS image are: blazingsql, bokeh, cudf, cugraph, cuml, cupy, cusignal, cuspatial, custreamz, cuxfilter, dask, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Pillow, Plotly, ONNX, Spacy, JupyterLab and jupyterlab-nvdashboard.

## "All" (Experimental)

If there are no dependency issues when buidling the image, the **all** image will try to include all the above listed libraries into a single Docker image (except RAPIDS)

```sh
docker run --runtime=nvidia -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/scw-ai/all:latest /bin/bash
```
