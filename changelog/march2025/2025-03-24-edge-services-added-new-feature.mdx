Scaleway’s Web Application Firewall (WAF) is currently available in public beta and provides automated protection for web applications against common threats and vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, XSS, remote code execution, and more. It is based on the OWASP Core Rule Set to detect and block malicious requests.

This WAF solution is fully managed and designed to be easy to integrate into existing architectures, particularly when combined with Scaleway's Edge Services.
WAF is currently available only via the [Edge Services API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/edge-services/).
