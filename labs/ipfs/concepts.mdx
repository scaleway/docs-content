## InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)

IPFS is a peer-to-peer protocol, made by [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/), for decentralized storage and content sharing.

## Peer-to-peer (P2P)

Architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged participants in the network. They form a peer-to-peer network of nodes.

## Content-based addressing

Data over IPFS is identified by its content, not by its location (like HTTP does), providing a new way to access data through a unique content identifier (CID). Consequently, data is immutable and verifiable, allowing any device to be involved in the network, enhancing the redundancy.

## Content Identifier (CID)

The content identifier is string of character that points to a content. That content can be -or not- available on the network. The CID is composed from the cryptographic hash of the content. It is used to identify and fetch the content throught the network.

## Pin

A pin is a content that is keep available through the IPFS network until it is unpinned.

## Volume

A volume is an abstract storage area that can hold a set of pins, which can be done via URLs or CID.
