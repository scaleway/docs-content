Angular is a development platform that can scale from single-developer projects to enterprise-level applications. The platform is built on TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, and provides features such as:
* A component-based framework for building scalable web applications
* A collection of libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more
* A suite of developer tools to develop, build, test, and update code

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have a [Container Registry namespace](/containers/container-registry/how-to/create-namespace/)
  - You have installed Angular on your local computer 
  - You have installed Docker on your local machine to build and push the Docker image
  - You have [configured your SSH key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key)
</Message>

<Message type="requirement">
Make sure `angular-cli` is installed on your local machine. If you have not installed it yet, run `sudo apt install angular-cli` on Ubuntu/Debian Linux based machines or install it using Homebrew on macOS: `brew install angular-cli`.

## Creating a demo application

1. Run the command below to create a new Angular application. It initializes a new project and creates the files required to build the application.
    ```
    ng new demo-app
    ```
2. Enter the application directory:
    ```
    cd demo-app
    ```
    Run the command `ls` to see a list of the applications' files: 
    ```
    README.md          node_modules       src                tsconfig.spec.json
    angular.json       package-lock.json  tsconfig.app.json
    karma.conf.js      package.json       tsconfig.json
    ```
3. Type the following command to run the development server: 
    ```
    ng serve
    ```
4. Open a web browser and point it to `http://localhost:4200` to see the Angular application: 
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-demo-app-running.webp" alt="" />

    Press `CTRL+C` in your terminal to stop the development server. 
5. Add a `nginx-configuration.conf` file inside the `demo-app` directory and add the following content to it:
    ```sh
    # Expires map
    map $sent_http_content_type $expires {
        default                    off;
        text/html                  epoch;
        text/css                   max;
        application/json           max;
        application/javascript     max;
        ~image/                    max;
    }

    server {
      listen 80;
      location / {
          root /usr/share/nginx/html;
          index index.html index.htm;
          try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html =404;
        }
      expires $expires;
      gzip  on;
    }
    ```

    The configuration file above contains information about expiration headers for images and other content (CSS, HTML, etc.) and switches `gzip` compression on to improve the performance of the application.
6. Create a Dockerfile named `Dockerfile` in the applications' directory and copy the following information into it:
    ```
    # Build and compile the frontend
  FROM node:latest as build-stage
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY package*.json /app/
  RUN npm install -g @angular/cli
  RUN npm install
  COPY ./ /app/
  RUN ng build --output-path=./dist/out --configuration production
  # Get the compiled app ready to be served with Nginx
  FROM nginx:latest
  COPY --from=build-stage /app/dist/out/ /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY ./nginx-configuration.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
    ```

## Building and publishing the Docker image

<Message type="important">
  Make sure that you have [connected your namespace](/containers/container-registry/how-to/connect-docker-cli/) to the Docker CLI before running the following steps.
</Message>

1. Run the following command to build the Docker image: 
    ```
    docker build -t demo-app:latest .
    ```
2. Tag the Docker image: 
    ```
    docker tag demo-app:latest rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/demo-namespace/demo-app:latest
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      * Make sure you replace `demo-namespace` with the name of your [Container Registry namespace](/containers/container-registry/how-to/create-namespace/).
      * Make sure that the [privacy settings](/containers/container-registry/how-to/manage-image-privacy-settings/) of your namespace are set to **public**.
    </Message>
3. Push the image to the registry: 
    ```
    docker push rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/demo-namespace/demo-app:latest
    ````

## Deploying the application on Serverless Containers

1. Click **Containers** in the Serverless section of the side menu of the Scaleway console. A list of your container namespaces displays. 
2. Click the name of the namespace in which you want to deploy the application. The list of your containers displays.
    <Message type="tip">
      If you do not have a container namespace yet, click **+ Create a namespace** to create a new one. 
    </Message>
3. Click **Deploy a Container**. The container deployment wizard displays. 

    Provide the following information to deploy the container:
      - Choose the pushed image in your registry's namespace and set the port value to 80. 
        <Lightbox src="scaleway-choose-container.webp" alt="" />
      - Choose a name and an optional description for the container
      - Define the container's resources
      - Configure the scaling of your application
      - Leave the other options at their default values
4. Click **Deploy a Container** to deploy your application. Your application displays in the list of containers: 
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-deployed-containers.webp" alt="" />
5. Click on the container's name. The container information page displays. Click the **Container Settings** tab. The container endpoint displays in the container information block. 
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-container-endpoint.webp" alt="" />

Copy the endpoint URL and open it in a web browser. The Angular application displays. It can now automatically scale based on the application's load and within the ranges set for the deployment.
