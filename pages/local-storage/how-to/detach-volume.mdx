You can detach a Local Storage volume from your Instance when it is powered off. It is important to [unmount the volume](/block-storage/api-cli/unmounting-a-volume/) from the operating system before detaching it to avoid data loss.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created a [Local Storage volume](/local-storage/how-to/create-volume/) that is [attached](/local-storage/how-to/attach-volume/) to an Instance


<Message type="important">
    Your Instance must be [powered-off](/instances/how-to/power-off-instance/) before you can detach any Local Storage volume from it.

1. Click **Local Storage** in the **Storage** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The Local Storage page displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Detach** next to the volume of your choice. A pop-up displays.
3. Click **Detach volume** to confirm.
