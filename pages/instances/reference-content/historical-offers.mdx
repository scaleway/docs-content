## ENT1 Instances

ENT1 Instances are high-end, dedicated cloud Instances for demanding workloads. They offer the highest consistent performance per core to support real-time applications. In addition, their computing power makes them generally more robust for compute-intensive workloads.

They are best suited for production websites, enterprise applications, high-traffic databases, and any application that requires 100% sustained CPU usage such as monitoring and analytics software. This includes Prometheus and Grafana, gaming sessions, and ad serving.

See below the technical specifications of Enterprise Instances:
