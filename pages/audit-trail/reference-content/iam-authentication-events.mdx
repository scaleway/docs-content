This page explains how to differentiate IAM members authentication methods and understand and how they appear in Audit Trail.

This page only covers **Unauthenticated API** methods that actually perform and/or complete an authentication step.

## Authentication code login

This flow allows a user to log in using an **authentication code** sent via email.

- `InitiateMagicCodeLogin`
  Sends the user an email containing a 6-digit authentication code.

- `CreateMagicCodeLogin`
  Authenticates the user based on their username and the 6-digit authentication code received.

If multifactor authentication (MFA) is required, the flow proceeds to `CheckLoginMFAOTP`. Otherwise, the flow redirects to `CommitLogin`.


## Password login

This method allows you to authenticate using a username and password.

- `CreatePasswordLogin`
  Authenticates the user with their username and password.

If MFA is required, the system verifies it through `CheckLoginMFAOTP`. If not, the flow continues directly to `CommitLogin`.



## OAuth2 login

This flow is based on external OAuth2 authentication providers.

- `InitiateOAuth2Login`
  Redirects the user to the external OAuth2 provider for authentication.

- `CreateOAuth2Login`
  Finalizes authentication once the OAuth2 provider confirms the user identity.

As with the other methods, if MFA is required, `CheckLoginMFAOTP` is triggered before committing the login. Otherwise, the flow continues to `CommitLogin`.


## SAML login

This flow integrates with **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)** for Single Sign-On (SSO).
It allows you to set up identity federation on your Organization and provide your teams with secure access to their accounts via an Identity Provider (IdP).

- `InitiateSamlLogin`
  Starts the SAML login and redirects the user to the IdP.

- `CreateSamlLogin`
  Finalizes authentication once the SAML response is received and validated.

As with the other methods, if MFA is required, `CheckLoginMFAOTP` is triggered before committing the login. Otherwise, the flow continues to `CommitLogin`.

## Common steps

- `CheckLoginMFAOTP`
  Validates the Multi-Factor Authentication one-time password (OTP) if required.

- `CommitLogin`
  The final step of the login process. Transforms the authenticated session into a JWT (JSON Web Token).

- `RenewJWT`
  Exchanges a valid login session/refresh context for a new JWT without re-authenticating credentials. JWTs are valid for 1 hour. If a member refreshes the Scaleway console or performs actions more than 1 hour after the last creation or update of a JWT, the JWT will be renewed.


## Summary of authentication methods

| Method name                | Description                                                        | Authentication flow      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **InitiateMagicCodeLogin**| Sends the user an email containing a 6-digit authentication code.         | Authentication code login         |
| **CreateMagicCodeLogin**  | Authenticates using username and the 6-digit authentication code.           | Authentication code login         |
| **CreatePasswordLogin**   | Authenticates using username and password.                         | Password login           |
| **InitiateOAuth2Login**   | Redirects the user to the OAuth2 provider for authentication.      | OAuth2 login             |
| **CreateOAuth2Login**     | Finalizes authentication after OAuth2 provider confirmation.       | OAuth2 login             |
| **InitiateSamlLogin**      | Redirects the user to the SAML IdP.                              | SAML login               |
| **CreateSamlLogin**        | Finalizes login after SAML response validation.                  | SAML login               |
| **CheckLoginMFAOTP**       | Validates MFA OTP when required.                                 | All flows (if MFA)       |
| **CommitLogin**            | Commits login and issues the JWT.                                | All flows                |
| **RenewJWT**               | Renews the JWT without full re-authentication.                   | Session maintenance      |
