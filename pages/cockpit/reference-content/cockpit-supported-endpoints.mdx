Cockpit supports telemetry ingestion and querying using the following open-source technologies:

- [Mimir](https://grafana.com/oss/mimir/) for metrics
- [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) for logs
- [Tempo](https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/) for traces
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/) for the alert manager

Cockpit exposes a subset of their HTTP APIs so users can push, query, and manage telemetry data from Cockpit.

    <Message type="important">
     Scaleway does not support all endpoints from these upstream APIs. Refer to the exact lists below to find out which endpoints are supported.
    </Message>

<Macro id="requirements" />

  - A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization or Project
  - [Created](/cockpit/how-to/create-token/) a Cockpit token with the right [permissions](/cockpit/concepts/#cockpit-tokens)
  - Retrieved the URL of your data source from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/cockpit/dataSource) or the [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/cockpit/regional-api/#path-data-sources-list-data-sources)

## Mimir supported endpoints (metrics)

The base URL pattern for metrics is the following: `https://<data-source-id>.metrics.cockpit.<region>.scw.cloud`. You must replace `<data-source-id>` with the ID of your data source and `<region>` with the region where your data source is located (`fr-par`, `nl-ams`, or `pl-waw`).

Refer to the [official Mimir documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/mimir/latest/references/http-api/) for more details about the endpoints below.
