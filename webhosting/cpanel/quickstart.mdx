cPanel is a website management control panel tool, providing users with a graphical interface and fast access icons which allow the configuration and monitoring of their hosting solutions. Features like publishing websites, launching databases, creating emails, and managing files are available through the cPanel interface with elevated performance.

## How to access the Webmail 

The classic Scaleway Dedibox webmail interface will remain available via the [website](https://webmail.online.net). If you wish to manage your e-mails through cPanel, you can access the webmail platform directly via the cPanel dashboard.

## How to configure the Nameserver

Nameservers are servers used to translate domain names into IP addresses. When you enter a URL in a browser, they show you where the website is located, instead of memorizing entire numerical sequences in the form of IP addresses.

If you are migrating from another webhosting offer to the new Cloud Hosting offer powered by cPanel, you might need to update your nameserver information with the following new addresses:

* ns1.whm.fr-par.scw.cloud
* ns2.whm.fr-par.scw.cloud

</Message>

1. From the console, click **Domain** on the upper menu of the Scaleway Dedibox console. A list of your domain names displays.
