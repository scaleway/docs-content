title: Migrating Object Storage data with Minio client
description: This page shows you how to migrate Object Storage data from one region to another with Minio client
excerpt: |
  Minio Client provides a modern alternative to UNIX commands like ls, cat, cp, mirror, diff etc. It is able to communicate with any S3 compatible cloud storage provider and can be used to migrate data from one region to another.

[Minio client](https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-client-quickstart-guide.html) provides a modern alternative to UNIX commands like ls, cat, cp, mirror, diff etc. It is able to communicate with any S3 compatible cloud storage provider and can be used to migrate data from one region to another.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have [configured your SSH Key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- You have object storage buckets in two different regions

</Message>

## Installing the Minio client

1. [Connect to your instance](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/) as `root`via SSH. 

2. Update the APT package cache and the software already installed on the instance:
  ```
  apt update && apt upgrade -y
  ```

3. Download the Minio Client:
  ```
  wget https://dl.minio.io/client/mc/release/linux-amd64/mc -P /usr/bin/
  ```

4. Make the file executable:
  ```
  chmod +x /usr/bin/mc
  ```

## Configuring the Minio Client and migrating data

1. Configure the endpoints you wish to use
  ```
  mc config host add scw-fr-par https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud <ACCESS_KEY> <SECRET_KEY> --api S3v4
  mc config host add scw-nl-ams https://s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud <ACCESS_KEY> <SECRET_KEY> --api S3v4
  ```

  <Message type="note">

  Replace `<ACCESS_KEY>` and `<SECRET_KEY>` with the credentials of your [API key](/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key/).

  </Message>

2. Optionally, add other providers:

  For S3 compatible storages:
    ```
    mc config host add s3 <ENDPOINT> <OTHER_ACCESS_KEY> <OTHER_SECRET_KEY> --api S3v4
    ```

  For google cloud storage :
    ```
    mc config host add gcs  https://storage.googleapis.com <ACCESS_KEY> <SECRET_KEY> --api S3v2
    ```

3. Create the buckets you need on the scaleway object storage
  ```
  mc mb --region fr-par scw-fr-par/<BUCKET_NAME>
  mc mb --region nl-ams scw-nl-ams/<OTHER_BUCKET_NAME>
  ```

4. Start the migration of your data:
  ```
  mc cp --recursive s3/<BUCKET_NAME> scw-fr-par/<BUCKET_NAME>
  mc cp --recursive gcs/<OTHER_BUCKET_NAME> scw-nl-ams/<OTHER_BUCKET_NAME>
  ```
  The commands above

    1.  migrates data from a S3 compatible object storage to Scaleway's **fr-par** object storage
    2.  migrates data from GCS object storage to Scaleway's **nl-ams** object storage

  <Message type="important">

  Please note that this migration can incur some cost from the object storage you are migrating **from** since they may or may not bill egress bandwitdth.

  The Minio Client displays a status bar during the transfer, allowing to observe the status of the migration:
