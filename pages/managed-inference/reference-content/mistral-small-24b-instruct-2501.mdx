## Model introduction

Mistral Small 24B Instruct is a state-of-the-art transformer model of 24B parameters, built by Mistral.
This model is open-weight and distributed under the Apache 2.0 license.

## Why is it useful?

- Mistral Small 24B offers a large context window of up to 32k tokens and provide both conversational and reasoning capabilities.
- This model supports multiple languages, including English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Dutch, and Polish.
- It supersedes Mistral Nemo Instruct, although its tokens throughput is slightly lower.

## How to use it

### Sending Inference requests

To perform inference tasks with your Mistral model deployed at Scaleway, use the following command:

```bash
curl -s \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <IAM API key>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--request POST \
--url "https://<Deployment UUID>.ifr.fr-par.scaleway.com/v1/chat/completions" \
--data '{"model":"mistral/mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501:fp8", "messages":[{"role": "user","content": "Tell me about Scaleway."}], "top_p": 1, "temperature": 0.7, "stream": false}'
```

Make sure to replace `<IAM API key>` and `<Deployment UUID>` with your actual [IAM API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) and the Deployment UUID you are targeting.

<Message type="note">
  Ensure that the `messages` array is properly formatted with roles (system, user, assistant) and content.
</Message>

### Receiving Managed Inference responses

Upon sending the HTTP request to the public or private endpoints exposed by the server, you will receive inference responses from the managed Managed Inference server. 
Process the output data according to your application's needs. The response will contain the output generated by the LLM model based on the input provided in the request.
