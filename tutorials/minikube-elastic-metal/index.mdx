Kubernetes is a powerful open-source platform designed for managing containerized workloads and services, boasting a rapidly expanding ecosystem. It orchestrates computing, networking, and storage infrastructure to streamline user workloads efficiently. Originally released by Google in 2014, Kubernetes offers declarative configuration and automation capabilities, making it a preferred choice for modern software development and deployment.

With Kubernetes, you gain access to several features, serving as:

- a robust container platform
- an efficient microservices platform
- a portable cloud platform, and much more.

[Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) is a valuable tool that simplifies Kubernetes development and testing workflows by running a single-node Kubernetes cluster within a virtual machine on your local computer or cloud server.

Minikube provides support for various essential Kubernetes features, including:

- DNS resolution
- NodePort services
- ConfigMaps and Secrets management
- Dashboard visualization
- Compatibility with multiple container runtimes: Docker, rkt, CRI-O, and containerd
- Integration with Container Network Interface (CNI)
- Ingress configuration for routing external traffic to Kubernetes services.

## Downloading and Installing Minikube

1. Check if the CPU of your server supports hardware virtualization. The output of the following command shall not be empty:
	```
	egrep --color 'vmx|svm' /proc/cpuinfo
	```
2. Minikube relies on a Hypervisor to run the Kubernetes VM. This tutorial uses [KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine)](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page), but it is also possible to run Minikube on [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
	```
	apt-get install qemu qemu-kvm libvirt-bin virtinst curl
	```
3. Download the Minikube binary and make it executable:
	```
	curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64 && sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
	```
4. Download and install the KVM driver for Minikube:
	```
	curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/docker-machine-driver-kvm2 && chmod +x docker-machine-driver-kvm2
	```
5. Copy the binary file to `/usrlocal/bin/` to make it available system-wide, then remove the downloaded binary:
	```
	cp docker-machine-driver-kvm2 /usr/local/bin/ && rm docker-machine-driver-kvm2
	```
6. Download and install `kubectl`, a [CLI tool](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) to manage Kubernetes:
	```
	curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl && chmod +x kubectl
	```
7. Copy the binary file to `/usrlocal/bin/` to make it available system-wide, then remove the downloaded binary:
	```
	cp kubectl /usr/local/bin && rm kubectl
	```

## Using Minikube

1. Start Minikube:
	```
	minikube start --vm-driver=kvm2
	```

	An output informs you about the status of Minikube:

		```
		😄  minikube v1.31.1 on linux (amd64)
		✨  Automatically selected the docker driver. Other choices: virtualbox, ssh
		📌  Using Docker Desktop driver with root privileges
		👍  Starting control plane node minikube in cluster minikube
		🚜  Pulling base image ...
		💾  Downloading Kubernetes v1.27.3 preload ...
		🔥  Creating docker container (CPUs=2, Memory=4000MB) ...
		🐳  Preparing Kubernetes v1.27.3 on Docker 24.0.4 ...

			▪ Configuring RBAC rules ...
		🔗  Configuring bridge CNI (Container Networking Interface) ...
			▪ Using image gcr.io/k8s-minikube/storage-provisioner:v5
		🔎  Verifying Kubernetes components...
		🌟  Enabled addons: storage-provisioner
		🏄  Done! kubectl is now configured to use "minikube" cluster and "default" namespace by default
		```
2. Check the health status of `minikube`:
	```
	minikube status
	```

	```
	minikube
	type: Control Plane
	host: Running
	kubelet: Running
	apiserver: Running
	kubeconfig: Configured
	```
3. Start a deployment that manages a pod. The pod runs a container based on the provided Docker image:
	```
	kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.39 -- /agnhost netexec --http-port=8080

	```

	Once the deployment is created, a message confirms the step:

	```
	deployment.apps/hello-node created
	```
4. Check the running pods and configured deployments:

	```
	kubectl get deployments
	```

	```
	NAME         READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
	hello-node   1/1     1            1           98s
	```

	Expose the pod to the public internet using the `kubectl expose` command
	```
	kubectl expose deployment hello-node --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080
	```
	The `--type=LoadBalancer` flag indicates that you want to expose your service outside of the cluster.
5. View the service you created in the previous step:
	```
	NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
	hello-node   LoadBalancer   10.102.149.85   <pending>     8080:32112/TCP   2s
	kubernetes   ClusterIP      10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP          11m
	```
6. Run the following command to open a browser window that serves the app and shows the app's response:
	```
	minikube service hello-node
	```
7. Delete the `hello-node` service:
	```
	kubectl delete services hello-node
	```
8. Delete the deployment:
	```
	kubectl delete deployment hello-node
	```

	A confirmation displays:

	```
	deployment.extensions "hello-node" deleted
	```
9. Stop Minikube:
	```
	minikube stop
	```

	A confirmation displays:

	```
	✋  Stopping node "minikube"  ...
	🛑  Powering off "minikube" via SSH ...
	🛑  1 node stopped.
	```
