## Alias

An email alias is an additional email address for an email account, with which a user can send and receive emails, or set forwards to. A single user account can have multiple email aliases, with different domains or even with the same domain.

## cPanel

cPanel is a web hosting control panel that simplifies the management of websites and servers. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface, allowing users to easily perform tasks such as creating email accounts, managing files, and installing applications. cPanel is widely used by website owners to streamline the administration of their web hosting services.

## Dedicated IP

Dedicated IP is a paid option that provides the capability for each hosting to possess a unique IP, separate from the shared default IP.

Opting for a dedicated IP is ideal if you intend to send emails and safeguard your IP reputation. This ensures that you will not be affected by the negative reputation other clients sharing the same IP may have.

</Concept>

## Email account

An email account is an email address on which mail is stored (unlike an alias / catchall). You can check your mail accounts via two protocols: POP3 and IMAP.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## FTP account

FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, is a protocol that allows you to transfer files between different computers over the Internet. It allows you, as part of your Web Hosting plan, to transfer your files from your computer to Scaleway.com - e.g. to update your website. It also works the other way around: you can recover the files stored on Scaleway.com and transfer them to your personal computer, e.g. to make a backup.

</Concept>

## Filtering

Filtering allows you to sort your emails depending on different criteria (the sender, the subject, the object and much more). If the email meets one or more criteria you can define different actions (delete the email, move it into a folder, etc).

</Concept>

## htaccess

`.htaccess` is a simple text file containing commands for the configuration of the Apache web server. It allows you to personalize the server dynamically and per folder. The configuration values are inherited through directories. Common applications for setting up a `.htaccess` file are switching between PHP4 and PHP5, protection of a part of the site, redirecting a website to another, or customizing error messages. Once on the server, its name must be `.htaccess`, starting with a dot.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## PHP

PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. While PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, it now stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, which is a recursive backronym. 

</Concept>

<Concept>

## php.ini

The `php.ini` file is the configuration file used for applications that require PHP. It contains variable configurations such as upload size, file timeout, and resource limits. For Scaleway Web Hosting, we provide PHP with the most common values preconfigured. If required, you can [customize the configuration of PHP](/dedibox-console/classic-hosting/how-to/configure-php/) to suit your needs.

</Concept>

## Plesk

Plesk serves as a web hosting control panel, akin to cPanel, aiming to streamline the management of websites and servers. Its user-friendly interface facilitates tasks such as domain management, email configuration, and database administration. Plesk can easily be extended with additonal features using the [Plesk Extension Catalog](https://www.plesk.com/extensions/).
