Multifactor authentication helps make your account safer. When enabled, after entering your password, a security code generated by your phone is required each time you log in. This authentication method ensures your account remains protected even in case of leaked passwords.

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- Downloaded a multi-factor authenticator application to your phone

1. Click your username, next to _logged in as_, in the top right corner of the console. Then click **Security** in the pop-up menu.

2. The security page displays. Click **Show QR code** to display the QR code and add the Scaleway Dedibox console to your authenticator application.

      If your phone does not have a camera, you can manually enter the registration key shown in the console.

3. Open the authenticator application on your phone and scan the code using the application.
4. A registration code is displayed on your phone's display. Enter this code in the activation form and click **Enable** to validate.

Your account is now protected by multifactor authentication, and a security token will be requested upon your next login.

<Message type="important">
Make sure to keep your authentication device secure, as you cannot log in without the authentication token.
