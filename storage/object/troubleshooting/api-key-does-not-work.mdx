<Macro id="requirements" />

- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## Problem

When using third-party API or CLI tools such as the [AWS CLI](/storage/object/api-cli/object-storage-aws-cli/), MinIO Client, or Rclone to manage your Object Storage resources, you may experience one of the following issues connecting to the Scaleway API or listing your resources:

- Listing your buckets with a third-party tool returns nothing, but you have at least one bucket created in the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/object-storage/buckets).

- The tool returns `An error occurred (Forbidden) when calling the ListObjectsV2 operation: Forbidden` or a similar message.

## Cause

The API key you used to configure the S3 third-party tool has a [preferred Project](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#preferred-project) assigned.

If you try to perform S3 operations in a Project that is **NOT** the [preferred Project](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#preferred-project) using a third-party tool, you will not be able to access your resources, resulting in an error message or an empty response.

## Solution

You can change the preferred project of your API key:

- by editing it from the [Scaleway console](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/manage-api-keys/#how-to-edit-an-api-key)
- by [overriding it while making an API call](/identity-and-access-management/iam/api-cli/using-api-key-object-storage/#overriding-the-preferred-project-when-making-a-call)

You should now be able to list your buckets using a supported S3-compatible third-party tool.

## Going further

- Refer to the documentation on [using IAM API keys with Object Storage](/identity-and-access-management/iam/api-cli/using-api-key-object-storage/) for more information.

- If you did not manage to identify the error and solve it by yourself, [open a support ticket](/console/account/how-to/open-a-support-ticket/), and provide as many details as possible, along with the necessary information below:
    - S3 Endpoint (e.g. `s3.fr-par.scw.cloud`)
    - Bucket name
    - Object name (if the request concerns an object)
    - Request type (PUT, GET, etc.)
    - HTTP status code
    - Date and time (timestamp)
    - User-agent (SDK, client, console, etc.)
    - Transaction ID (if possible)
    - Log / trace of the error (if possible)
