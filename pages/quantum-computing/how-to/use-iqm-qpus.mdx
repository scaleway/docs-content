**IQM Quantum Computers** is the European leader in building superconducting quantum computers. Headquartered in Finland, IQM provides on-premises quantum computers for supercomputing centers and research laboratories, as well as cloud access.

Their technology is based on **superconducting transmon qubits**, the most established approach in the industry (similar to IBM or Google). These processors operate at near-absolute zero temperatures using dilution refrigerators. IQM's unique "co-design" strategy optimizes hardware for specific applications, but they also offer powerful general-purpose processors.

### Hardware Comparison

The table below summarizes the key technical specifications and pricing models for each available QPU.

### Detailed Overview

#### 1. Garnet (20 Qubits)
Ideally suited for benchmarking standard gate-based algorithms and running small-scale variational circuits (VQE, QAOA). It is a robust and stable system, making it the perfect entry point for exploration.

#### 2. Sirius (24 Qubits)
This processor features a unique "star" topology. Currently, **16 qubits are fully operational** and exposed for computation. It is specifically interesting for testing algorithms that benefit from high connectivity centers, differing from standard grids.

#### 3. Emerald (54 Qubits)
IQM's latest generation processor. With **54 qubits**, Emerald crosses a significant threshold, allowing for the execution of circuits that are difficult to simulate classically (depending on depth). It is designed for advanced research, exploring Quantum Advantage, and running deep circuits.

## Accessing IQM via Qiskit

The primary way to program IQM machines on Scaleway is through **Qiskit**. You do not need to learn a proprietary language; standard Qiskit circuits are fully compatible.

The integration is handled by the **Scaleway Provider for Qiskit**, which manages the translation of your circuits and their submission to the specific IQM backend.

<Requirements />

To start using IQM resources, you will need:
* A Scaleway account with a valid **Project ID**.
* A Scaleway **API Key** (Secret Key).
* A Python environment with the `qiskit-scaleway` package installed.

### 2. Installation

Install the official [Scaleway provider for Qiskit](https://github.com/scaleway/qiskit-scaleway):

```bash
pip install qiskit-scaleway
```

### 3. Connection and execution

The workflow is identical to other gate-based providers on the platform. You connect using your credentials, select the specific IQM backend you want to target, and run your circuit.

  **Emulator Availability:** Currently, there are no specific high-performance GPU emulators (Digital Twins) available for IQM chips on QaaS platform. Jobs are executed directly on the physical QPUs.

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit_scaleway import ScalewayProvider

# 1. Connection credentials
PROJECT_ID = "your-scaleway-project-id"
SECRET_KEY = "your-scaleway-secret-key"

# 2. Initialize the Scaleway Provider
provider = ScalewayProvider(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    secret_key=SECRET_KEY
)

# 3. Select the Backend
# - 'QPU-SIRIUS-24PQ' : Sirius real hardware (Paid per shot)
# - 'QPU-GARNET-20PQ' : Garnet real hardware (Paid per shot)
# - 'QPU-EMERALD-54PQ' : Emerald real hardware (Paid per shot)
backend_name = "QPU-GARNET-20PQ"

try:
    backend = provider.get_backend(backend_name)
    print(f"Connected to backend: {backend.name}")

    # 4. Create a Quantum Circuit (e.g., Bell State)
    # Note: IQM supports square-lattice connectivity, so you don't need to worry about coupling maps.
    qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
    qc.h(0)
    qc.cx(0, 1)
    qc.measure_all()

    # 5. No transpilation
    # Scaleway QaaS handles the transpilation server-side for you

    # 6. Execute the Job
    # Warning: On the real QPU, this line triggers billing.
    print("Submitting job...")
    job = backend.run(qc, shots=100)

    # 7. Retrieve Results
    result = job.result()
    print("Results:", result)

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

<Message type="tip">
  Always check the connectivity map (topology) of the specific QPU you are targeting, especially for Sirius, to optimize your circuit transpilation.
