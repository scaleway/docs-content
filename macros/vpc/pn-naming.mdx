<Message type="note">
The resource name can only include alphanumeric characters and dashes. Avoid using a **T**op **L**evel **D**omain as your Private Network name, as this can cause addressing conflicts. For example, do not call your Private Network `dev`, `cloud` or `com`. For a complete reference of TLDs to avoid, see the full list provided by [IANA](https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt). Read more about this issue in our [dedicated documentation](/vpc/troubleshooting/pn-name/).
