[Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/) is an open-source video conferencing service solution providing fully encrypted and secure high quality and audio without subscription or the need to create an account. The solution can either be installed natively on [Ubuntu Bionic Beaver (18.04 LTS)](/tutorials/jitsi-ubuntu-bionic) and [Debian Buster](/tutorials/jitsi-debian). Another way to install it, is using a containerized application running on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

This tutorial explains how to install the Jitsi Meet solution on an Instance using the [Docker Image](https://github.com/jitsi/docker-jitsi-meet) provided by the Jitsi team, allowing you to deploy your personal Jitsi Meet video conferencing solution in a few easy steps. It is based on a Debian stable base installation and provides all additional modules available for Jitsi like [Etherpad](https://etherpad.org/) or [jigasi](https://github.com/jitsi/jigasi), a gateway allowing SIP connections to the Jitsi Meet Instance.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An [Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance) running on Ubuntu Bionic Beaver (or later) with **at least 4 GB of RAM**.
- A [domain or subdomain](/network/domains-and-dns/quickstart/) pointed to your Instance

## Setting up the solution

1. [Connect to your Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/) via SSH.
2. Update the package cache and upgrade the software already installed on the Instance using the `apt` package manager:
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
3. Install Docker, for more detailed instructions, follow our [tutorial](/tutorials/install-docker-ubuntu-bionic/).
    ```
    apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | apt-key add -
    add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
    apt update
    apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli docker-compose containerd.io git
    ```
4. Clone the Docker Jitsi Meet repository using `git` and `cd` into the downloaded directory:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/jitsi/docker-jitsi-meet && cd docker-jitsi-meet
    ```
5. Copy the `env.example` file to create an environment (`.env`) configuration and create the required configuration directories:
    ```
    cp env.example .env
    mkdir -p ~/.jitsi-meet-cfg/{web/letsencrypt,transcripts,prosody,jicofo,jvb}
    ```
6. Open the `.env` file in a text editor and edit the basic settings as follows:
    ```
    #
    # Basic configuration options
    #
    # Directory where all configuration will be stored.
    CONFIG=~/.jitsi-meet-cfg
    # Exposed HTTP port.
    # Set this value to 80 for the default HTTP port
    HTTP_PORT=80
    # Exposed HTTPS port.
    # Set this value to 443 for the default HTTPS port
    HTTPS_PORT=443
    # System time zone.
    TZ=Europe/Amsterdam
    # Public URL for the web service.
    # Configure the public URL of your Jitsi Meet Instance
    PUBLIC_URL=https://jitsi.example.com
    # IP address of the Docker host. See the "Running on a LAN environment" section
    # in the README.
    #DOCKER_HOST_ADDRESS=192.168.1.1
    #
    # Let's Encrypt configuration
    #
    # Uncomment the following lines to enable SSL certificates issued by Let's Encrypt
    # Enable Let's Encrypt certificate generation.
    ENABLE_LETSENCRYPT=1
    # Domain for which to generate the certificate.
    # Set this to public domain name of your Jitsi Meet Instance
    LETSENCRYPT_DOMAIN=jitsi.example.com
    # E-Mail for receiving important account notifications (mandatory).
    LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=me@email.com
    [...]
    ```
7. Make sure that the following ports are open if you run a firewall on your Instance or have configured a [stateful cloud firewall](/compute/instances/how-to/use-security-groups/) using security groups.
    - 80/tcp for Web UI HTTP (for redirections, after uncommenting ENABLE_HTTP_REDIRECT=1 in .env)
    - 443/tcp for Web UI HTTPS
    - 4443/tcp for RTP media over TCP
    - 10000/udp for RTP media over UDP
8. Run `docker-compose up -d` to download and launch the application.
    <Message type="note">
      If you want to use the Etherpad option with Jisi Meet, configure the Etherpad section in the `.env` file and start the docker container with the following command: `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f etherpad.yml up`.
    </Message>

## Connecting to the Instance

1. Open a web browser on your local computer and access the web UI at `https://<public_instance_ip>/`. The Jitsi Meet login screen displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-jitsi_login.webp" alt="" />

Enter a name for your conference and press `Go` to enter the conference room. It is now possible to share the link, to set a password, configure the audio and video quality and more for the conference.
