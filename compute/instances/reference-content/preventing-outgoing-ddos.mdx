  The explanations given below are known best practices. They do not guarantee that your resources will not be locked if we detect that they are part of a DDoS attack.

## DoS Overview

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is an attack through which a person can render a system unusable, or significantly slow it down for legitimate users, by overloading its resources.

[A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack](DDoS_Quick_Guide.pdf) is a DoS attack that is performed at the same time by a multitude of compromised systems.

The goal of a DoS is not to gain unauthorized access to machines or data, but to prevent legitimate users of a service from using it.

You are responsible for your resources.
If a resource you control takes part in a DDoS, you will be considered responsible for attacking the target of this DDoS.

Scaleway will lock any resources (e.g. Instances, Kubernetes clusters, Elastic Metal servers) that are identified as a contributor to a DDoS.
This lock can be done without prior notice to protect our network and the target network; this is written in our Terms and Conditions ([Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/en/terms/), [Scaleway Dedibox](https://www-uploads.scaleway.com/cgv_en_36883f3024.pdf/)).

## Preventing Memcache from being used in a DDoS attack

[Memcached](https://memcached.org/) is a free & open-source, high-performance, distributed memory object caching system.
It is used as a key-value store in memory.

[Memcached can be used in DDoS](https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki/DDOS/) because of its large amplification factor.

**Recommendations**

To configure securely your memcache, proceed as follows:

Ensure that in your `/etc/memcached.conf` you have both settings defined:

```conf
# Disable UDP listening
-U 0`

# Listen only on localhost
-l 127.0.0.1
```

## Preventing NTP to be used in a DDoS attack

[Network time protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol/) (NTP) servers are regularly being used to reflect and amplify spoofed UDP packets towards the target of a DDoS attack.

NTP servers where the `monlist` command can be run by any unauthorized users are particularly troublesome.
These commands provide a huge amplification effect to the attacker.

**Recommendations**

To configure securely your NTP server, proceed as follows:

- If you need to have an NTP server running, upgrade your NTP server as much as possible.
- Use a [secure configuration](https://github.com/team-cymru/network-security-templates/tree/master/Secure-NTP-Templates/) as much as possible
- Avoid having an NTP server open on the internet. Try to restrict access to localhost only.
- If you need to have an NTP server open, be sure to specify which range of IPs can access your NTP server.

## Preventing DNS from being used in a DDoS attack

Domain Name System (DNS) is a commonly used protocol to perform DDoS attacks because of its UDP-based protocol and lack of security features by default.
DNS amplification attacks almost always take advantage of open resolvers.
An open resolver is a DNS server that answers queries for a domain name without restrictions: anybody on the internet can query it and it will answer.
This makes it particularly troublesome as a spoofed IP address that will generate a reflection attack.

In addition to that, a DNS reply is usually larger than its corresponding query.
Therefore, DNS can be used to have an amplification effect.

**Recommendations**

To configure securely your DNS server, proceed as follows:

- Do not run an open DNS resolver on the internet. Restrict your DNS server to answer only requests coming from your IP range.
- Do not enable recursion on your DNS server
- If you need recursion, limit the authorized range of IPs that can perform those requests.
  - [BIND](https://kb.isc.org/docs/aa-01316/)
  - [unbound](https://nlnetlabs.nl/documentation/unbound/unbound.conf/)
  - If you use PowerDNS, you can also use [dnsdist](https://dnsdist.org/index.html/).
- Enable RateLimiting of queries and answers from your authoritative DNS
  - [BIND](https://kb.isc.org/docs/aa-00994/)
  - [unbound](https://nlnetlabs.nl/documentation/unbound/unbound.conf/)
  - If you use PowerDNS, you can also use [dnsdist](https://dnsdist.org/index.html/).
- Set ACL on your remote control if used and limit it to localhost if possible
  - [rndc for BIND](https://mirror.apps.cam.ac.uk/pub/doc/redhat/redhat7.3/rhl-rg-en-7.3/s1-bind-rndc.html/)
  - [dnsdist for PowerDNS](https://dnsdist.org/index.html/)
  - [unbound-control for unbound](https://nlnetlabs.nl/documentation/unbound/unbound-control/)

## Preventing HTTP(s) proxy from being used in a DDoS attack

HTTP(s) proxies are software that will perform an HTTP(s) request in place of a client and forward the response to the client.
This can be used in the case of a DDoS attack to perform amplification (a small request can generate a large answer) and reflection (IP address can be spoofed).

**Recommendations**

To configure securely your HTTP proxy, proceed as follows:

- Do not run HTTP proxies that are open on the internet.
- Limit as much as possible the range of IPs of machines that can connect to your HTTP(s) proxy.
