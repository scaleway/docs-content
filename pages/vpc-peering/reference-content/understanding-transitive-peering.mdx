This document covers the behavior of transitive peering when using Scaleway VPC Peering.

## Overview

Scaleway VPC Peering natively supports transitive peering relationships across chained VPCs connected one another using peering connectors. This means VPC A can communicate with VPC C via an intermediate VPC B (A ↔ B ↔ C), even though VPC A and C are not directly connected with a peering connector.

To enable transitive peering, additional [custom routes](#custom-routes) must be created in each VPC of the transitive chain. Routing complexity therefore increases with the number of chained VPCs. For this reason, transitivity is limited to 4 consecutively chained VPCs.

Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/vpc-peering/reference-content/understanding-transitive-peering/) for more information on transitive peering.
