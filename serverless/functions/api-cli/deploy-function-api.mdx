The Scaleway API allows you to create and manage all your Scaleway resources programmatically. Anything you can do through the [Scaleway console](https://www.console.scaleway.com)
can also be done through the API. 

Refer to the [Scaleway Developers website](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/) for more information on the Scaleway API.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
  - You have installed [curl](https://curl.se/download.html)
  - You have [made your first request](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/#quickstart:-first-request) using the Scaleway API

1. Run the following command in your terminal to create a functions namespace:

  ```json
  curl -X POST \
  -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
      "name": "<YOUR_NAMESPACE_NAME>",
      "project_id": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
  }' \
  "https://api.scaleway.com/functions/v1beta1/regions/fr-par/  namespaces"
  ```

  An output similar to the following displays:

  ```json
  {"id":"example-fb93-43e3-a036-7be69f1af7a1", "name":"your-namespace-name", "environment_variables":{}, "organization_id":"example-776f-4f65-a41e-6c5fc58b4076", "project_id":"example-c162-43f7-bb3e-1182e6f12342", "status":"pending", "registry_namespace_id":"", "error_message":null, "registry_endpoint":"", "description":"", "secret_environment_variables":[], "region":"fr-par"}%  
  ```

2. Run the following command to create a function:

  ```json
  curl -X POST \
  -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "<YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME>",
    "namespace_id": "<YOUR_NAMESPACE_ID>",
    "runtime": "<RUNTIME>"
  }' \
  "https://api.scaleway.com/functions/v1beta1/regions/fr-par/functions"
  ```

  An output similar to the following displays:

  ```json
  {"id":"ef777a64-1f4e-4d43-8227-26927c7de057", "name":"your-function-name", "namespace_id":"example-fb93-43e3-a036-7be69f1af7a1", "status":"created", "environment_variables":{}, "min_scale":0, "max_scale":5, "runtime":"python310", "memory_limit":256, "cpu_limit":140, "timeout":"300s", "handler":"handler.handle", "error_message":null, "privacy":"public", "description":"", "domain_name":"namespaceg04rnwx-function-example.functions.fnc.fr-par.scw.cloud", "secret_environment_variables":[], "http_option":"enabled", "runtime_message":"", "build_message":null, "region":"fr-par"}%  
  ```

3. Create a zip file containing your function's code by following [this procedure](/serverless/functions/how-to/package-function-dependencies-in-zip/).

  <Message type="note">
    For testing purposes, you can create a zip archive with a simple Python file named `handler.py` inside, that contains the following code:

    ```python
    def handle(event, context):
    return {
        "body": {
            "message": 'Hello, world',
        },
        "statusCode": 200,
    }
    ```
  </Message>

4. Upload your zip file [using the Scaleway console](/serverless/functions/how-to/package-function-dependencies-in-zip/#how-to-upload-your-zip-file-to-the-scaleway-console) or [using the Scaleway API](/serverless/functions/how-to/package-function-dependencies-in-zip/#how-to-upload-your-zip-file-using-the-scaleway-api).

5. Run the following command to deploy your function:

  ```json
  curl -X POST \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{}' \
    "https://api.scaleway.com/functions/v1beta1/regions/fr-par/functions/<YOUR_FUNCTION_ID>/deploy"
  ```

  Your function is now being deployed.

  <Message type="tip">
    You can check the status of your function from the [Scaleway console](https://www.console/scaleway.com/) or by running the following command:

    ```json
    curl -X GET \
      -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
      "https://api.scaleway.com/functions/v1beta1/regions/fr-par/functions/<YOUR_FUNCTION_ID>"
    ```
  </Message>

6. Run the following command to call your function once it is deployed:

```bash
curl <YOUR_FUNCTION_ENDPOINT>
```
