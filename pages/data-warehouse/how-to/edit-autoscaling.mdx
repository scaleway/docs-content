This page explains how to edit the autoscaling configuration of your Data Warehouse for ClickHouse® deployment using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Signed up to the private beta](https://www.scaleway.com/fr/betas/) and received a confirmation email.
- Created a [Data Warehouse deployment](/data-warehouse/how-to/create-deployment/)

<Message type="important">
Updating the autoscaling configuration of your deployment is disabled during the private beta phase. You must [create a new deployment](/data-warehouse/how-to/create-deployment/) with the desired autoscaling values instead.
