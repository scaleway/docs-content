This page shows how to connect to your Scaleway Instance via SSH. Thanks to the SSH key that you created and uploaded, you can use a terminal application on your local computer to remotely connect to your Instance as root. This enables you to use your Instance as you wish.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An [Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/)

    ### How to connect to Linux Instances from OSX (Mac) and Linux

    1. Open a terminal program.
    2. Enter the command below into the terminal. Make sure you replace `your_private_key` with the filename of your private key (often `id_ed25519`) and `your_instance_ip` with the IP address of your Instance.
        ```bash
        ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_private_key root@your_instance_ip
        ```
        <Message type="tip">
        To find the IP address of your Instance, log into the Scaleway console and
        click **CPU & GPU Instances** in the Compute section of the side menu. A list of your
        Instances and their associated IP addresses will display.
        </Message>
    3. If / when prompted, allow connection to the host by typing `yes`, then press **Enter**.
        ```
        The authenticity of host 'myhost.ext (212.47.226.35)' can't be established.
        RSA key fingerprint is 4f:ba:65:cf:14:64:a7:1e:b6:07:7c:00:71:95:21:fa.
        Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
        ```

        You are now connected to your Instance.

    ### How to connect to Linux Instances from Windows

    To connect to your Instance from Windows, you will need to use a small application called **PuTTY**, an SSH client.

    1. [Download and install PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).
    2. Launch PuTTY on your computer. The main screen of the application displays:
        <Lightbox image={image} alt="" />
    3. Enter your Instance's IP address in the **Hostname** field.
        <Message type="tip">
          To find the IP address of your Instance, log into the Scaleway console and
          click **CPU & GPU Instances** in the Compute section of the side menu. A list of your
          Instances and their associated IP addresses will display.
        </Message>
    4. In the side menu, expand the **Connection**, **SSH** and **Auth** submenus, then click **Credentials**:
        <Lightbox image={image2} alt="" />
    5. Click the **Browse** button and select the private key file you [generated previously](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/).
    6. Click **Open** at the bottom of the screen to open a connection to the Instance. Upon the first connection, PuTTY asks you to allow the connection to the host.
    7. Click **OK** to confirm.
        <Lightbox image={image3} alt="" />

        The terminal window displays.
    8. Enter the username `root` and press **Enter** to authenticate against the server with your SSH key.
        <Lightbox image={image4} alt="" />

        You are now connected to your Instance.

       ### How to connect to Windows Instances
      <Message type="important">
        * The steps below are valid only for Instances running Microsoft Windows as operating system.
        * You must have the [Scaleway CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli) installed and configured on your local machine to be able to retrieve your Windows administrator password.
      </Message>
      1. Click **CPU & GPU Instances** in the **Compute** section of the left side menu. The Instances dashboard displays.
      2. Select the Availability Zone (AZ) from the drop-down menu (e.g., `PAR1`) to view resources in the selected AZ.
      3. Select the name of the Instance you wish to connect to.
      4. Click **Get password** to retrieve the password for your Instance. A pop-up will display a command for retrieving your initial password using the Scaleway CLI:
          ```bash
          scw instance server get-rdp-password <YOUR_INSTANCE_ID> zone=<YOUR_AVAILABILITY_ZONE> key=<YOUR_PRIVATE_RSA_SSH_KEY_FILE>
          ```
      5. Open a terminal and paste the command. Replace `<YOUR_INSTANCE_ID>`, `<YOUR_AVAILABILITY_ZONE>`, and `<YOUR_PRIVATE_RSA_SSH_KEY_FILE>` with your Instance ID, the corresponding Availability Zone, and the path to your private RSA SSH key, respectively:
          ```bash
          $ scw instance server get-rdp-password e48c5e3e-f3d6-49e5-93be-eacfe4c427fd zone=fr-par-1 key=~/.ssh/id_rsa
          ```
      6. The initial Administrator password will be displayed. Copy and save this password:
          ```plaintext
          Username           Administrator
          Password           nlW_=v->I"mWuEz
          SSHKeyID           73f6f13e-0f34-45d0-a61c-463e0289b4a4
          SSHKeyDescription  My RSA SSH key
          ```
      7. Launch your Remote Desktop client and enter your Instance's IP address, the username **Administrator**, and the initial password.
          <Message type="tip">
            - On Windows PCs, use the [built-in RDP client](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/how-to-use-remote-desktop-5fe128d5-8fb1-7a23-3b8a-41e636865e8c).
            - On Mac OS X, download the [Microsoft RDP client](https://apps.apple.com/en/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466).
            - On Linux, use your preferred remote desktop client, such as [Remmina](https://remmina.org/) (installed by default on Ubuntu-based distributions).
          </Message>
      8. Enter the username **Administrator** and the password, then click **Login**. The Windows desktop displays.
