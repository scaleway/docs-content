status: changed

Serverless Containers uses a product-specific authentication method based on JWT to authenticate requests for private endpoints. It is now possible to use the new IAM policy `ContainersPrivateAccess`.

Previous authentication method based on JWT will be deprecated gradually. Follow [How to migrate from JWT to IAM authentication for private containers](/serverless-containers/how-to/migrate-jwt-to-iam-authentication/).
