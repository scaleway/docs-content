Once you have successfully logged in for the first time, you must then comply with your Organization's security requirements to ensure you can log in without issues in the future. Refer to the [How to comply with security requirements as a Member](/organization-security/how-to/comply-with-sec-requirements-member) documentation page to follow the procedure.
