If you already own a domain, you can customize an Edge Services pipeline endpoint with a subdomain of your choice. This means you can access your Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer origin through Edge Services via your own subdomain rather than the standardized Edge Services endpoint.

For example, if you own `beautiful-domain.com`, you can customize the endpoint to be `whatever-i-want.beautiful-domain.com`. You must also add an SSL/TLS certificate so that Edge Services can securely serve your content via HTTPS.

You cannot customize your endpoint with a primary domain directly (e.g. `beautiful-domain.com`), only with a subdomain of it.

## How to configure a custom domain

The procedure for adding a customized endpoint is as follows:

1. In the Scaleway console, navigate to the Edge Services dashboard for the Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer origin whose domain you want to customize:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-services-dashboard.webp" alt="A screenshot of the Edge Services dashboard in the Scaleway console. This is a dashboard for Edge Services on an Object Storage bucket, showing links to the documentation, Scaleway Cockpit, the endpoint, cache settings and a button to disable the pipeline." />

2. In the **Endpoint** panel, click **Configure domain**. The following screen displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-configure-domain.webp" alt="A screenshot of the Configure Domain screen in the Edge Services part of the Scaleway console. Step one is to set a subdomain, step two is to provide an SSL/TLS certificate" />

3. Set a subdomain from which your Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer origin will be accessible via its Edge Services pipeline. You must already own the primary domain. For example, if you own `beautiful-domain.com`, choose any subdomain you like and enter `my-chosen-subdomain.beautiful-domain.com` into the box.

    It is **not** possible to use only a root domain (aka primary domain or apex domain), you must use a subdomain. This is because CNAME records, essential to point your domain to your Edge Services endpoint, cannot by definition be created for root domains, only for subdomains.

4. This step depends on whether the domain used in the previous step is managed with [Scaleway Domains and DNS](/network/domains-and-dns/), or an external domain provider. Choose the appropriate tab below.

    <Tabs id="edge-cname">
    
        <TabsTab label="Domains and DNS">
        The domain you are using for Edge Services is considered to be managed with Scaleway Domains and DNS if:
        - You [registered the domain](/network/domains-and-dns/how-to/register-internal-domain/) with Domains and DNS, or
        - You [transferred an externally-registered domain](/network/domains-and-dns/how-to/transfer-external-domain/) to Domains and DNS

        If either of the above is true, Scaleway will auto-detect that the domain is managed by Domains and DNS, and a message will display confirming that you do not need to create a CNAME record. We will auto-generate the appropriate CNAME record in your domain's [DNS records](/network/domains-and-dns/how-to/manage-dns-records/), to point your subdomain to the Edge Services endpoint. This record is generated when you click `Customize domain` in step 6.

        You should not attempt to modify or delete the CNAME record, which will be visible among your [DNS records](/network/domains-and-dns/how-to/manage-dns-records/) in the Scaleway console.
        </TabsTab>

        <TabsTab label="External provider">
        Scaleway cannot itself create the appropriate CNAME record to point your subdomain to Edge Services if your domain is managed by an external provider. You must create the CNAME record yourself.

        Log in to your domain provider, and locate the DNS settings for your domain. Create a new CNAME record pointing your subdomain to the Edge Services pipeline endpoint displayed in the Scaleway console. For help setting up CNAME records and troubleshooting any problems, [check out our dedicated documentation](/network/edge-services/reference-content/cname-record/).

        Back in the Scaleway console, click the `Verify CNAME` button to check whether your CNAME record has been correctly configured. Edge Services will carry out a check, and if it is successful the following message displays:

        <Lightbox src="scaleway-cname-success.webp" alt="Verification passed: Your DNS record has been correctly configured" />

        If the check fails, an error message will display. See the documentation linked above for help troubleshooting such errors. Note that it may take a short time for the DNS record to be propagated and the check to pass.
        </TabsTab>
    </Tabs>

5. Provide an SSL/TLS certificate for your subdomain so that Edge Services can serve traffic for it over HTTPS. You have three options for this:
    - Generate a free Let's Encrypt certificate, managed by Scaleway, including automatic renewals.
    - Select an existing certificate that you have stored in [Scaleway Secret Manager](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/quickstart/).
    - Manually import a certificate into Scaleway Secret Manager:
      - Enter a name for your certificate (alphanumeric characters only)
      - Optionally, add tags by typing each tag and then pressing enter
      - Copy and paste the full PEM-formatted certificate chain into the box.
      Your certificate will be automatically stored in Secret Manager and [billed accordingly](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/security-and-account/).

6. Click **Customize domain** to finish.

Your customized domain is set up, and you are returned to the Edge Services dashboard. The customized domain displays in the Endpoint panel. When you access your Object Storage or Load Balancer origin through this domain, its content will be served via Edge Services.

<Message type="note">
If you chose to generate a managed Let's Encrypt certificate, allow a few minutes for the certificate to finish creating. When the process is complete and the certificate is ready, you will see a green status light for **SSL/TLS certificate** on your endpoint dashboard.

## How to edit your customized domain or its certificate

After customizing your domain, you can edit it (or its certificate) at any time as follows:

1. In the Scaleway console, navigate to the Edge Services dashboard for the Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer origin whose domain you want to customize:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-services-dashboard.webp" alt="A screenshot of the Edge Services dashboard in the Scaleway console. This is a dashboard for Edge Services on an Object Storage bucket, showing links to the documentation, Scaleway Cockpit, the endpoint, cache settings and a button to disable the pipeline." />

2. In the **Endpoint** panel, click **Edit**. The **Edit Domain** screen displays.

3. Edit the subdomain as desired - do not forget to also set up a new CNAME record, if necessary.

4. Edit your certificate options as required - choose to generate a managed Let's Encrypt certificate, managed by Scaleway including automatic renewals, or select a different certificate from Secret Manager, or manually import a new certificate for your custom domain.

5. Click **Edit domain** to finish.

## How to reset your customized domain

Even though the original Edge Services endpoint (e.g. `https://pipeline-id-or-bucket-name.svc.edge.scw.cloud`) will continue to work after you add a customized domain, you can choose to remove your customized domain completely and go back to the original Edge Services endpoint only. This is done via the reset function:

1. In the Scaleway console, navigate to the Edge Services dashboard for the Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer origin whose domain you want to reset:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-services-dashboard.webp" alt="A screenshot of the Edge Services dashboard in the Scaleway console. This is a dashboard for Edge Services on an Object Storage bucket, showing links to the documentation, Scaleway Cockpit, the endpoint, cache settings and a button to disable the pipeline." />

2. In the **Endpoint** panel, click **Reset**.

    A screen displays, warning you that this will reset the pipeline's domain back to the default Edge Services endpoint. Edge Services will consider your customized subdomain as unknown. You should also remember to:
        - Delete your CNAME record from your domain provider, unless your domain is managed with Scaleway Domains and DNS, in which case we take care of deletion for you.
        - Delete any SSL/TLS certificates you imported into Secret Manager (if no longer required elsewhere, so that you are no longer billed for it). If you generated a managed Let's Encrypt certificate however, Scaleway takes care of the deletion for you.

3. Click **Reset domain** to finish.
