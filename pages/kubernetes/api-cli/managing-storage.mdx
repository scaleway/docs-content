The [Scaleway Block Storage volume](https://www.scaleway.com/en/block-storage/) Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver is an implementation of the [CSI interface](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md) to provide a way to manage Scaleway block volumes through a container orchestration system, like Kubernetes. It is installed by default on every Kubernetes Kapsule and Kosmos cluster.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
- Your Scaleway Project or Organization ID
- [Created](/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/) a Kubernetes cluster running on Scaleway Instances (v1.21+)

    Refer to our video tutorial [Getting Started with Kubernetes Part 4 - Storage](/kubernetes/videos/) to view a visual presentation and step-by-step guidance of how to manage Block Storage volumes on Kubernetes with the Scaleway CSI.

## Verification of CSI driver status

To verify if the driver is running, use the following command:

```bash
kubectl get csidriver
```

The output of this command provides a quick status update on the CSI plugin within your Kubernetes cluster. For the latest features and enhancements, consider upgrading to [release 0.3](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-csi/tree/release-0.3#block-storage-low-latency), which supports **[Block Storage low latency](/block-storage/quickstart/)** volumes.

To identify your current CSI release version, navigate to the [Cockpit interface](/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards/), specifically the **Kubernetes Cluster - Overview** dashboard.

## Upgrading to CSI version 0.3

<Message type="important">
  The Scaleway Block Volume Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver **v0.2** will reach its end of support on **February 28, 2025**.
</Message>

The migration moves volumes from the [Instances API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/) to the [Scaleway Block Storage API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/block/). No volume detachment is expected, only a control plane restart.
Newer storage classes have been introduced, with `sbs-default` set as the new default. The existing `scw-bssd` and `scw-bssd-retain` storage classes will remain available for now.


### Using the API with curl

You can trigger the migration to SBS-CSI using the following `curl` command:

```bash
curl "https://api.scaleway.com/k8s/v1/regions/$REGION/clusters/$CLUSTER_ID/migrate-to-sbs-csi" \
-X POST \
-H "X-Auth-Token: $TOKEN"
```

Replace the placeholders with the following:

- `$REGION`: Your cluster's region (e.g., `fr-par`, `nl-ams`).
- `$CLUSTER_ID`: Your cluster ID.
- `$TOKEN`: Your Scaleway API token.

This command will initiate the migration process for your cluster to the new SBS-CSI.

### Using the Scaleway CLI

Alternatively, you can use the Scaleway CLI to perform the migration. Ensure the CLI is installed and configured with your API credentials.

1. Install and configure the Scaleway CLI, if you have not already:
   ```bash
   scw init
   ```

2. Run the migration command:

   ```bash
   scw k8s cluster migrate-to-sbs-csi $CLUSTER_ID region=$REGION
   ```

   Replace `$REGION` and `$CLUSTER_ID` with your cluster’s region and ID, respectively.

### Post-migration verification

After initiating the migration, the cluster status will change to _updating_. Once the migration completes, you can verify that the CSI driver has been updated and that the new driver properly handles Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).

```bash
kubectl get csidriver
```

This command will confirm that the migration was successful.

      * `sbs-5k` and `sbs-15k` are pre-configured storage classes designed to meet your IOPS requirements. You can achieve the equivalent of setting `iops:5k` in your custom class.
