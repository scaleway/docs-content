**IP** **A**ddress **M**anager (IPAM) is Scaleway's tool for planning, tracking and managing the IP address space of Scaleway products. It acts as a single source of truth for the IP addresses of Scaleway resources.
 
You can use IPAM to reserve a private IP address from a given Private Network's [CIDR block](/network/vpc/concepts/#cidr-block). When you reserve an IP in this way, it stops it from being potentially auto-allocated to new resources being attached to the Private Network. You can then use the reserved address to attach the specific resource of your choice to the Private Network. If you later detach the resource from the network, the reserved IP will stay reserved, until you either release it back into the general pool, or use it to attach a different resource.

<Message type="note">
Currently, only **Instances**, **Load Balancers**, and **Public Gateways** are compatible with reserved private IPs. Support for Managed Databases and Elastic Metal servers will be coming soon.

This page sets out the steps necessary to reserve an IP address with IPAM.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- At least one [Private Network](/network/vpc/how-to/create-private-network/)

## How to reserve a private IP address

1. Click **IPAM** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu.

2. Click **Reserve private IP**. The following screen displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-reserve-ip.webp" alt="A pop-up screen, showing the parameters to define for the private IP to reserve: type (IPv4 or IPv6), tags, region, VPC and Private Network" />

3. Define the parameters for the private IP address you want to reserve:
    - **IP type**: IPv4 or IPv6
    - **Tags**: Tags to help you filter and manage your reserved IPs later
    - **Region**: The region in which you want to reserve a private IP address
    - **VPC**: The VPC in which you want to reserve a private IP address
    - **Private Network**: The Private Network in which you want to reserve a private IP address. The reserved IP will be from this network's [CIDR block](/network/vpc/concepts/), and available to attach resources to this network.

4. Define whether you want to specify the IP address to reserve, or reserve any available IP on the Private Network (the IP selected will be displayed after reservation). If specifying the IP address yourself, do **not** include the network prefix (e.g. `/22`).

    <Message type="tip">
    Four IP addresses from each CIDR block are unavailable for reservation: the first two and last two in the block. For example, for the subnet `172.16.12.0/22` the following addresses cannot be reserved or assigned to any resource: `172.16.12.0`, `172.16.12.1`, `172.16.15.254` and `172.16.15.256`.

    The IP address is reserved, and you are returned to the list of your private IP addresses, where the reserved address now displays. You can use this address to attach a resource to the Private Network you reserved it from. If and when you no longer need the reserved IP, you can [release](#how-to-release-a-reserved-private-ip-address) it.

## How to attach a resource to a Private Network using a reserved IP address

You can currently attach **Instances**, **Load Balancers**, and **Public Gateways** to Private Networks using a reserved IP address. Support for Managed Databases and Elastic Metal servers will be coming soon.

The option to use a reserved IP displays when you attach the resource to a Private Network in the console. Follow the instructions below:

- Attach a resource to a Private Network from the [Private Networks](/network/vpc/how-to/attach-resources-to-pn/) product dashboard
- Attach an Instance to a Private Network from the [Instances](/compute/instances/how-to/use-private-networks/#how-to-attach-instances-to-an-existing-private-network) product dashboard
- Attach a Load Balancer to a Private Network from the [Load Balancer](/network/load-balancer/how-to/use-with-private-network/) product dashboard
- Attach a Public Gateway to a Private Network from the [Public Gateways](/network/public-gateways/how-to/configure-a-public-gateway/#how-to-attach-a-public-gateway-to-a-private-network) product dashboard

## How to release a reserved private IP address

You can release a reserved IP address, as long as it is not attached to a resource. Releasing the IP means it goes back into the general pool of available IP addresses for that Private Network, and could potentially be auto-allocated to a new resource joining the network.

1. Click **IPAM** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu.

2. Click the three dot menu <Icon name="more" /> next to the IP you want to release, and then click **Release IP**.

    <Message type="note">
    Only reserved IPs that are not attached to a resource can be released.
    </Message>

    A message displays asking you to confirm you want to release the IP address.

3. Click **Confirm**.

    The IP address is released.
