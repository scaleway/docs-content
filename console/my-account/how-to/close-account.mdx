There are two ways you can close your account: by deactivating your Organization, or by definitively deleting your account and personal data. Read on to find out more and choose the method that best suits your preferences and needs.

## How to deactivate your Organization

Deactivating an Organization will permanently delete your Organization's servers, resources, services and backups. It will also deactivate the account. However, you can choose to reactivate your account at a later date if you wish, eliminating the need to recreate an account from scratch.

<Message type="note">
  There is a delay of up to 10 days between the time your Organization is closed and the time your resources are effectively destroyed. It is recommended to cancel all your resources before you close your Organization. A deactivated Organization can be reactivated upon your request.
