You can change your Database Instance the node type and enable High Availability after the nodes have been created.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [PostgreSQL or MySQL Database Instance](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/quickstart/)

## How to change the node type

<Message type="important">
  If you have a Database Instance that uses a Local volume, and you want to upgrade to a node type that uses Block volumes, you must [change the volume type](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/change-volume-type/) to Block Storage first.
</Message>

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Select the geographical region of the Instance you want to manage from the drop-down.
3. Click the name of the Database Instance you want to configure. Your database's Overview page displays.
4. Scroll down to the **Node settings** section. Then, click **Change node type**.
5. Choose the specifications of the new Database Instance from the drop-down list.
6. Click **Update node type** to confirm your choices.
    <Message type="important">
    Keep in mind that:
      - Changing the node type performs a rolling upgrade of your Database Instance.
      - During this process, the Database Instance will be unavailable for several seconds.
      - The Instance stays in `Initializing` mode throughout the process.
      - If you use local storage:
          - Make sure that the Database Instance you choose provides sufficient disk space for your database. Otherwise, an error message will be displayed, and the database will not be upgraded.
          - The process can take longer than expected, but the unavailability period of the Instance will be short. This means that though the Database Instance mostly remains available during the entire process, bar a few seconds.

## How to enable High Availability

You define your Database Instance's node configuration upon its [creation](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/create-a-database). Two node configuration modes are available with PostgreSQL or MySQL Database Instances.

- **High Availability**: creates a secondary Instance with an up-to-date replica of the database. If the primary Instance fails, the secondary takes over requests.
- **Standalone**: a standalone database provisioned on a single node.

If you are in standalone mode, you can change the node configuration to High Availability in the console at any time.

<Message type="important">
  Once you upgrade to the High Availability mode, you cannot revert to standalone.
