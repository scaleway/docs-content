title: Improved memory metric accuracy for sandbox v2
status: fixed

We have implemented a fix to improve the accuracy of memory usage metrics for Serverless Containers services. This update resolves a previous reporting inconsistency to ensure that metrics more precisely reflect actual resource consumption.

- **What changed:** We refined the underlying calculation used to report memory usage.

- **What to expect:** You may notice that memory metrics in your dashboards and views appear slightly lower than before. This is an expected result of the improved measurement accuracy, and does not indicate a change in your application's actual performance or resource allocation.

- **Scope:** This fix applies exclusively to services using sandbox `v2`.

No action is required on your part.
