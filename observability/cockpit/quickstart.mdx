Scaleway's Observability Cockpit allows you to monitor your applications and their infrastructure by giving you insights and context into their behavior. Cockpit also enables you to visualize your metrics, logs, and traces through a Grafana dashboard. It is automatically activated when you are using [Scaleway resources that are integrated into Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-limitations/#product-integration-into-cockpit).

The Observability Cockpit provides you with four [endpoints](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#endpoints) to push metrics, logs, and traces. You can push metrics with any Prometheus-compatible agent such as [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/) or [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/).
You can push logs with any Loki-compatible agent such as [Promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/), [Fluentd](https://docs.fluentd.org/), [Fluent Bit](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/) or [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/introduction.html).
You can push traces with the Tempo-compatible agent supported by Scaleway: [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/what-is-opentelemetry/).

Read [our documentation](/observability/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-limitations/) to find out which Scaleway products are integrated into Cockpit and learn [how to reduce extra costs and understand Cockpit pricing](/observability/cockpit/reference-content/understanding-cockpit-usage/).


In this quickstart, we show you how to retrieve your Grafana credentials, and how to create a push token to send metrics and logs to your Cockpit.

<Macro id="requirements" />

  - A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

<Message type="important">
 - Having the default configuration on your agents might lead to more of your resources' metrics being sent, a high consumption, and a high bill at the end of the month.
 - Sending metrics and logs for Scaleway resources or personal data using an external path is a billable feature. In addition, any data that you push yourself is billed, even if you send data from Scaleway products. Refer to the [product pricing](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/?tags=available,managedservices-observability-cockpit) for more information.

5. Choose a name for your token or use the already-generated name.

<Message type="tip">
  - If you have already set up an agent to collect and send your data, you can use our [dedicated documentation](/observability/cockpit/how-to/send-metrics-logs-to-cockpit/) to send data to your Cockpit.
  - If you have not set up any agent yet, check out our [documentation to find out how to configure the Grafana agent, push your data, and visualize it in Grafana](/observability/cockpit/api-cli/configuring-grafana-agent/).
