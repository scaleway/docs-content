After creating your cluster, you can renew its TLS certificate, change the attached Private Network, and change its password.

Other management actions for internally configuring your cluster, such as creating topics and events, and configuring partitions and replication factors, can be carried out via a Kafka-compatible client library or a Kafka CLI.

<Requirements />

  - A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
  - A Cluster for Apache Kafka®

## How to renew the TLS certificate

You may want or need to renew the cluster's TLS certificate for reasons of security, compliance or if the certificate expires. Follow the steps below to renew the certificate:

1. Click **Apache Kafka®** in the **Data and Analytics** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. A list of your clusters displays.

2. Click the cluster whose certificate you want to renew. Its **Overview** page displays.

3. In the **Connectivity** panel, click **Renew** next to the TLS certificate.

    A pop-up displays, warning you that you will not be able to connect to your cluster using the previous certificate, and you will need to download the new certificate for all clients.

4. Click **Renew TLS certificate** to confirm.

The certificate is renewed, and you are returned to the cluster's **Overview** page. Remember to download the new certificate for all clients that want to connect to the cluster.

## How to change the attached Private Network

In order to facilitate connectivity to your cluster, it must always be attached to a Private Network. A cluster can only be attached to one Private Network at a time, but you can change the attached Private Network as follows:

1. Click **Apache Kafka®** in the **Data and Analytics** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. A list of your clusters displays.

2. Click the cluster whose certificate you want to renew. Its **Overview** page displays.

3. In the **Network** panel, click **Detach Private Network**.

    A pop-up displays, asking you to confirm the action.

4. Click **Detach resource** to confirm.

The cluster is detached, and you are returned to its **Overview** page. Click **Attach Private Network** to choose a new Private Network to attach it to. Remember that the cluster is not accessible unless it is attached to a Private Network.

## How to change the password

During Public Beta, each cluster can have only one set of user credentials, which are set during cluster creation. You cannot change the username after creating the cluster, but you can change the password at any time:

1. Click **Apache Kafka®** in the **Data and Analytics** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. A list of your clusters displays.

2. Click the cluster whose password you want to change. Its **Overview** page displays.

3. Click the **Users** tab.

4. Click **Change password** next to the cluster's username credential.

    A pop-up displays, prompting you to change the password. Either enter the new password of your choice, or click **Generate password** to generate a new random password.

    Ensure that you copy or remember the password, as it will not be displayed again after this screen.

5. Click **Update**.

    The password is changed and you are returned to your cluster's **Overview** page.
