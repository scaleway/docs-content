## Availability Zone 

An Availability Zone refers to the geographical location in which your Instance will be created. The latency between multiple AZs of the same region is low, as they have a common network layer. Find below the list of availability zones by region:

- France - Paris (`fr-par`)
  `fr-par-1`
  `fr-par-2`
- The Netherlands - Amsterdam (`nl-ams`)
  `nl-ams-1`
- Poland - Warsaw (`pl-waw`)
  `pl-waw-1`

## Bare Metal server

Bare Metal servers allow you to order dedicated servers on-demand, like cloud Instances (Bare Metal as-a-Service). Bare Metal servers can be used for large workloads, big data and applications that require increased security and dedicated resources.

## Flexible IP

Flexible IP addresses are public IP addresses that you can hold independently of any Instance. When you create a Scaleway Instance, its public IP address is also a flexible IP address. Flexible IP addresses can be attached to and detached from any of your Instances as you wish. You can keep a number of flexible IP addresses in your account at any given time. When you delete a flexible IP address, it is disassociated from your account to be used by other users.

## Image

An image is a file that contains the OS, application data, and any files that might be related to your applications. If you do not know yet which image you want to run on the Bare Metal, you can order the server without preinstalled image.

## Local Volumes

Local Storage provides replicated NVMe SSD volumes directly connected to your Instance. Your server requires a minimum local storage.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Public IP

Public IP addresses are routed on the Internet. You can enter the public IP address of your Instance into any browser connected to the Internet, and access content being served from that Instance. You can think of public IP addresses like postal addresses for buildings - they are unique, and tell the routers directing traffic through the Internet where to find a particular server.

## Region

A Region is represented as a Geographical area such as France (Paris: `fr-par`) or the Netherlands (Amsterdam: `nl-ams`). It can contain multiple Availability Zones.

## Remote Access

Each Bare Metal server provides a dedicated [KVM over IP device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch#KVM_over_IP_(IPKVM)) which allows you to access the keyboard, video, and mouse of the machine remotely. It enables you access to the machine even in case the installed OS is not working properly, to debug the system or to install an own OS from a remote ISO file.

## Rescue Mode

Rescue mode restarts your server via the network on a minimal operating system. You can use rescue mode to debug your server and recover your system data. Rescue mode creates a ramdisk with the content of a downloaded rootfs. You will have access to all your disks and will be able to perform debug and rescue actions. After disabling rescue mode, you will have to reboot your server. Your server needs to be running to switch to rescue mode.

## Tags

Tags allow you to organize your resources. This gives you the possibility of sorting and filtering your cloud assets in any organizational pattern of your choice, which in turn helps you arrange, control and monitor your cloud resources. You can assign as many tag as you want to each Scaleway product.
