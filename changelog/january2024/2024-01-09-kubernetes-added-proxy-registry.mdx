Kubernetes Kapsule now benefits from a proxy registry in all regions, caching required system images for new clusters and new nodes. 
This addition eliminates rate limiting from the official container registries used to pull system images, and eases scaling large node pools in [full isolation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/containers/kubernetes/reference-content/secure-cluster-with-private-network/#what-is-the-difference-between-controlled-isolation-and-full-isolation) mode.
