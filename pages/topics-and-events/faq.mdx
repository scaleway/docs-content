## What is Topics and Events?

Scaleway Topics and Events is a product for creating managed messaging topics based on the AWS SNS protocol. Previously, it was part of the Messaging and Queuing product.

## What is SNS?

**S**imple **N**otification **S**ervice, or SNS, is a [publish/subscribe](/topics-and-events/concepts/#publishsubscribe) notification service for the mass delivery of messages. SNS acts as a single message bus that can be sent to a variety of devices and platforms through a single code interface. It is also possible to adapt message formats to the particular needs of each platform. 

## Does Scaleway Topics and Events support all SNS features?

The following subscriber types are supported:
- HTTP/S clients
- Serverless Functions and Containers
- Scaleway Queues

For more details on supported and unsupported Topics and Events features, see our [dedicated page](/tpoics-and-events/reference-content/sns-support/).

## How is Topics and Events billed?

Billing is based on [topic Volume](/messaging/concepts/#queue-volume) (the total sum of each message's size going out from the topic to the subscriptions).
