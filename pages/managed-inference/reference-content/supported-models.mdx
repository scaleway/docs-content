## Models supported on Managed Inference

Managed Inference supports multiple AI models either from:
- [Scaleway catalog]((#scaleway-catalog)): A curated model list available in [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com/inference/deployments/) or through [Managed Inference Models API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/inference/#path-models-list-models)
- [Custom models](#custom-models): Models imported by you as a user from sources such as HuggingFace.

### Prerequesites

To deploy a model by providing its URL on Hugging Face, you need to:
- Have access to this model with your Hugging Face credentials (if the model is "Gated", you specifically need to ask access from your Hugging Face account). Note that your Hugging Face credentials will not be stored, but we still recommend you to create [read or fine-grained access tokens](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens) for this purpose.
