If you have a [Scaleway account](/console/my-account/how-to/create-an-account), and subsequently an [Organization](/console/my-project/concepts#organization), you will also automatically have a [default Project](/console/my-project/concepts#default-project), that contains all your existing [resources](/console/my-project/concepts#resources). You can also create additional Projects, allowing you to group your resources. 

<Message type="note">

  The default Project takes on the Organization ID. Therefore, the **default** status cannot be transferred to other Projects, nor can the default Project's name be altered.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) 

</Message>

1. From the Organization Dashboard which displays when you log into the console, click the **Projects** tab. A list of your Projects displays.

2. Click **+ Create Project** on the righthand side and a pop-up appears. 

3. Enter the **Project Name** and **Description** in the corresponding boxes. 

4. Click **Create new Project** and the new Project is added to the list.
