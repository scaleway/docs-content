This page includes the specificities of the environmental footprint calculation for Block Storage.

## Resources used for estimation
The main unit taken into account in the Block Storage footprint estimation is **VOLsto**, which represents the **reserved volume** per user.

The total estimated impact is calculated by integrating:

- **Manufacturing impact** - Related to the physical servers hosting the storage volumes.
- **Shared infrastructure impact** - The impact of the tools used to manage the Block Storage offers: control plane, monitoring, internal load balancers, and others.
- **Energy usage impact** - The average electricity consumption of storage servers and their energy efficiency.

## Calculation aspects

### Ratio per storage volume
To allocate the impact of a specific storage volume, we apply the following RCP allocation rule:

- Attribution of the manufacturing impact to **VOLsto**: with a **factor of 3 to account for replication**.
We use this ratio in the rest of the calculations.

### Manufacturing impact
The manufacturing impact is attributed based on the servers hosting the storage:

Retrieval of **hardware specifications** of Block Storage servers → The only available data source today is the [Confluence BLOCK STORAGE page](https://confluence.internal.scaleway.com/display/BLOCK+STORAGE), which will need to be transcribed into a YML file (2 different types of HW currently). In this YML file, we indicate the available volume, which corresponds to 60% of the total volume (the rest being reserved for performance reasons).

### Shared infrastructures
| Component | Description | Hardware | Manufacturing & Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Control Plane | List of infrastructure VMs used by the Block Storage team | All VMs of the tenant [https://netbox.internal.scaleway.com/tenancy/tenants/212/](https://netbox.internal.scaleway.com/tenancy/tenants/212/), "blk" VMs of the tenant [https://netbox.internal.scaleway.com/tenancy/tenants/148/](https://netbox.internal.scaleway.com/tenancy/tenants/148/) | Calculate impact as done for Apple Silicon product VMs |
| Data Plane | List of servers used by the Block Storage team | All devices of the tenant [https://netbox.internal.scaleway.com/tenancy/tenants/148/](https://netbox.internal.scaleway.com/tenancy/tenants/148/) | Calculate manufacturing impact via [Boavizta](https://www.boavizta.org/), retrieve electricity consumption estimation and multiply by PUE and energy mix |

*   The allocation is done **based on electrical power**: we need to retrieve the electrical power dedicated to Block Storage:
    *   Retrieval of the estimation of the electricity consumption of the Block Storage servers –> [Handbook](https://handbook.scaleway.com/) (static data, like for Elastic Metal).
    *   Retrieval of the **quantities of hardware of the Data plane**.
    *   We add the **electricity consumption of the Control Plane VMs**.
