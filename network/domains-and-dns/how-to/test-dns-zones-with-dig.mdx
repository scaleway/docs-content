`Dig` or `domain information groper` is a command line tool used to query domain information on [DNS](/network/domains-and-dns/concepts/#dns) servers. You can use it to troubleshoot DNS issues.

`Dig` is installed by default on most Unix operating systems. You will however need to [install it if you are using Windows](https://www.isc.org/download/).

This page shows you how to use the `dig` command to perform some common DNS tests. You do not need to have registered domains with Scaleway Domains and DNS to use this documentation page, but if you are using Scaleway Domains and DNS, refer to the **Before you start** section.

<Macro id="requirements" />

  - A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - [Added](/network/domains-and-dns/how-to/add-external-domain/) **external domains** with Scaleway Domains and DNS or not
  - [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status of the Organization in which the actions will be performed, or be an IAM user with the [necessary permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission)
  - Installed `dig`


### Performing a basic DNS query


Open a terminal and paste the following command to get a general overview of your domain's DNS configuration.

```
dig <your-domain.com>
```

This command could be useful if you want to verify the DNS configuration of a website before migrating it to a new server, for example. By running `dig` without any additional arguments, you can see if the domain's DNS records are resolving correctly and if you need to make any changes before the migration.


### Querying a specific record type


The following command allows you to retrieve your domain's [DNAME](/network/domains-and-dns/reference-content/understanding-dns-records/#dname-record) record. This command allows you to focus on particular aspects of your domain's DNS configuration.

```
dig <your-domain.com> DNAME
```

This command could also be useful if you are troubleshooting email delivery issues for a domain, for example. By querying the domain's MX record with `dig`, you can verify that the mail server listed is correct and accessible. If there is an issue with email delivery, checking your domain's MX record can help pinpoint potential misconfigurations.


### Performing a reverse DNS lookup

The following command allows you to verify the authenticity of an IP address, identify its associated domain name, and check for misconfigurations or suspicious activity.

```
dig -x <IP address>
```

This command could be useful if you notice unusual traffic originating from an IP address in your server logs, for example. Performing a reverse DNS lookup with dig can reveal the domain name associated with that IP address. This information can help you determine if the traffic is legitimate or if further investigation is needed to address potential security threats.
