Pi-hole is a DNS sinkhole that blocks unwanted ads and trackers at the network level. When combined with a VPN, it provides a secure and ad-free internet browsing experience.

This guide will show you how to:
- Deploy a secure ad-blocking VPN using **Pi-hole**
- Install either OpenVPN or WireGuard using **PiVPN**
- Implement best security practices to protect your Instance

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)

## Deploying the Instance

1. Log in to the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) and **create a new Instance**.
2. Choose **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** as the operating system.
3. Once the Instance is created, connect to it via SSH:
   ```sh
   ssh root@your_instance_ip
   ```
4. Update and upgrade your system:
   ```sh
   apt update && apt upgrade -y
   ```

## Installing Pi-hole

1. Download and run the installer:
   ```sh
   wget -O basic-install.sh https://install.pi-hole.net
   chmod +x basic-install.sh
   ./basic-install.sh
   ```
2. Follow the on-screen prompts:
   - Select an upstream DNS provider (Google, Cloudflare, Quad9, etc.)
   - Choose **IPv4 + IPv6 filtering**
   - Install the **Pi-hole Web Interface**
   - Set a **strong password** using:
     ```sh
     pihole -a -p
     ```
3. Configure Pi-hole for local access only:
   ```sh
   pihole -a -i local
   ```

### Optimizing Pi-hole
To enhance privacy, you can set up **Unbound**, a local recursive DNS resolver:
```sh
apt install unbound -y
```
Then, edit Pi-hole settings to use `127.0.0.1#5335` as your custom upstream DNS.

## Installing PiVPN (OpenVPN or WireGuard)
PiVPN allows us to configure a VPN server with either **OpenVPN** or **WireGuard**.

Run the following commands to install PiVPN on your Instance.
```sh
wget -O pivpn-install.sh https://install.pivpn.io
chmod +x pivpn-install.sh
./pivpn-install.sh
```

During installation, you will be prompted to choose:
- OpenVPN (wider compatibility with older devices, but slower)
- WireGuard (faster, modern encryption, recommended)

Follow the setup prompts and select:
- A non-root user (`openvpn` or `wireguard`)
- Default settings for encryption and networking
- Custom port (e.g., `4343` or `23854` instead of the default 1194 to increase security)

## Enhancing security

### Firewall configuration
Restrict access to only necessary services:
```sh
ufw allow 22/tcp
ufw allow 53/udp
ufw allow 4343/tcp  # If using OpenVPN on port 4343
ufw allow 23854/udp  # If using WireGuard
ufw enable
```

### Change OpenVPN default port
Edit OpenVPN’s configuration file:
```sh
nano /etc/openvpn/server.conf
```
Change `port 1194` to `port 4343` (or another port of your choice), then restart OpenVPN:
```sh
systemctl restart openvpn
```

### Enable Fail2Ban
Prevent brute-force attacks by installing Fail2Ban:
```sh
apt install fail2ban -y
systemctl enable fail2ban --now
```

## Adding VPN users
For OpenVPN:
```sh
pivpn add
```
For WireGuard:
```sh
pivpn wg add
```
Download the VPN configuration file securely using SCP or SFTP.

## Testing your VPN
- Connect your device using an OpenVPN or WireGuard client.
- Verify that your IP has changed by visiting [whatismyip.com](https://www.whatismyip.com/)
- Check if ads are blocked

## Conclusion
You now have a secure, ad-blocking VPN setup using Pi-hole and OpenVPN/WireGuard. This setup ensures privacy, security, and a better browsing experience across all your devices.

For further optimizations, consider adding a DNS-over-HTTPS setup or custom blocklists for Pi-hole.
