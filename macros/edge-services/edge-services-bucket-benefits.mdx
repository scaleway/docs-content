- Customize your bucket's endpoint using a subdomain of your own domain
- Add your own SSL/TLS certificate, safeguarded in [Scaleway Secret Manager](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/quickstart/), or generate a managed Let's Encrypt certificate, so your subdomain can serve content from your bucket over HTTPS
- Enhance performance by caching your stored objects, to be served directly by Edge Services from the cache
- Finely control your cached objects via purging (cache invalidation)

<Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-services-pipeline.webp" alt="A diagram shows the elements and workflow of an Edge Services pipeline. The user connects to the customizable Edge Services endpoint (with its SSL/TLS certificate), which fetches content from the Edge Services cache, which itself fetches content to cache from an origin which is either an Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer" />
