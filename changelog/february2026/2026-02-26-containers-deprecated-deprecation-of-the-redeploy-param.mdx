**Deprecation of the `redeploy: false` parameter in the `UpdateContainer` endpoint**  

The `redeploy: false` option in the `UpdateContainer` API (`PATCH /containers/v1beta1/regions/{region}/containers/{container_id}`) is now deprecated. This parameter was previously used to prevent redeployment of containers when no configuration changes occurred. Going forward, the API will systematically redeploy containers when necessary, and any use of `redeploy: false` will be ignored.

We strongly advise against relying on this field in your automation or deployment workflows. If you need to force a redeployment regardless of configuration changes, please use the dedicated `DeployContainer` method instead.
