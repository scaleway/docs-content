When you create a Redis™<sup>*</sup> Database Instance, you have to specify a user. It will be created with [set permissions](/managed-databases/redis/reference-content/default-user-permissions/).

You can specify a name for this user when you create a Database Instance. This allows you to ensure the username is compatible with different software integrations where specific usernames are not supported.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
- Downloaded and installed the [Scaleway CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli#scaleway-cli-v2)
- [Configured your environment variables](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/blob/master/docs/commands/config.md) (optional)

## Specifying a name for a user

Follow the [create a Database Instance](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/managed-database-redis/#quickstart) procedure.

<Message type="tip">
You can also define a username when you [create a Redis™ Database Instance](/managed-databases/redis/how-to/create-a-database-for-redis/) via the Scaleway console.
</Message>

You are required to specify a username and password for the default user in your POST request payload.

<Message type="important">
<br />
For a username to be valid, it must:
  - contain only letters, numbers, hyphens, dollars, and underscores
  - be between 1 and 63 characters long
  - not start with `_rkv`
  - start with a letter
  - not be `scalewayadmin` or `metrics`
</Message>

## Retrieving the default username

You can retrieve the default username via the API and the CLI.

<Tabs id="get database instance">
  <TabsTab label="API">
    Run the following curl command in a terminal to `GET` information about your Redis™ Database Instance of choice and retrieve the default username. Replace `zone` and `cluster_id` in the path with the zone and cluster ID of your Database Instance of choice.

    ```bash
    curl -X GET \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
    'https://api.scaleway.com/redis/v1/zones/{zone}/clusters/{cluster_id}'
    ```
  </TabsTab>

  <TabsTab label="CLI">

    Run the following command in a terminal to `GET` information about your Redis™ Database Instance. Replace `<cluster_id>` with the ID of your Database Instance of choice.

    ```bash
    scw redis cluster get <cluster-id>
    ```

  </TabsTab>
</Tabs>

A response like the following is returned:

```json
{
"id": "string",
"name": "string",
"project_id": "string",
"status": "string",
"version": "string",
"endpoints": [],
"tags": [],
"node_type": "string",
"created_at": "string",
"updated_at": "string",
"tls_enabled": "boolean",
"cluster_settings": [],
"acl_rules": [],
"cluster_size": "integer",
"zone": "string",
"user_name": "redis-admin",
"upgradable_versions": []
}
```

<Message type="important">
  The example above is a simplified version of the response. `strings` and `boolean` are replaced with actual values in a real response.
</Message>

You can find the default username under `"user_name":`. In this example, the default username is `redis-admin`.

## Changing the default username

You can change the username and password of the default user anytime via the API and the CLI.

<Tabs id="get database instance">
  <TabsTab label="API">
    Run the following curl command in a terminal to update your Redis™ Database Instance. Replace `zone` and `cluster_id` in the path with the zone and cluster ID of your Database Instance of choice. In the body of the request, replace `<your-new-username>` and `<your-new-password>` with your username and password of choice.

    ```bash
    curl -X PATCH \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "user_name":"<your-new-username>",
      "password":"<your-new-password>"
      }' \
    "https://api.scaleway.com/redis/v1/zones/{zone}/clusters/{cluster_id}"
    ```

    A response including the information of your Database Instance appears to indicate the update was successful.

  <TabsTab label="CLI">

    Run the following command in a terminal to `GET` information about your Redis™ Database Instance. Replace `<cluster_id>` with the ID of your Database Instance of choice. Replace `<cluster-id>` with your Database Instance ID, and  `<your-new-username>` and `<your-new-password>` with your username and password of choice.

    ```bash
    scw redis cluster update <cluster-id> user-name="<your-new-username>" password="<your-new-password>"
    ```
