You may create a peering connector, and then see that it has a status of `Conflict`. This page explains that status, and gives you tips on resolving the issue so your connector can move to a status of `Peered`.

## Understanding conflict status

A `Conflict` status means that a matching connector has been created, but the two VPCs to peer contain Private Networks with overlapping [CIDR blocks](/vpc-peering/concepts/#cidr-block). A peering connection cannot be created until this conflict is resolved.

For example, imagine the following scenario:

**VPC A** contains:
- Private Network X with CIDR block: `172.16.20.0/22`
- Private Network Y with CIDR block: `172.16.24.0/24`
- Private Network Z with CIDR block: `10.10.0.0/16`

**VPC B** contains:
- Private Network J with CIDR block: `172.16.23.0/24`
- Private Network K with CIDR block: `192.168.1.0/24`
- Private Network L with CIDR block: `10.10.5.0/24`

A conflict occurs because the CIDR block `172.16.20.0/22` (in VPC A) overlaps with `172.16.23.0/24` (in VPC B). The `172.16.20.0/22` block covers all IP addresses from `172.16.20.0` to `172.16.23.255`, which includes the entire `172.16.23.0/24` range.

Since both VPCs define Private Networks that claim ownership of the same IP address space, traffic cannot be safely routed between them over a peering connection without causing network ambiguity or outages. No peering connection can be established until the conflict is resolved.

## Identifying conflicting Private Networks

For security and privacy reasons, Scaleway does not disclose which specific Private Networks are involved in a CIDR conflict. Revealing such information would expose details about the network topology of the peer VPC — something that should only be shared between trusted parties.

You must contact an owner or manager of the target VPC, and together compare the CIDR blocks of your respective Private Networks to identify the overlap. Since both sides have full knowledge of their own network configurations, collaborating on this comparison allows you to pinpoint the conflicting subnets without requiring Scaleway to disclose sensitive network details. 

The CIDR block of each Private Network in a VPC can be viewed in the [VPC section of the Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/vpc/). A tool such as [https://cidrclash.com/](CIDR Clash Calculator) can help you identify overlaps.

## Resolving the conflict

It is not currently possible to modify the CIDR block of a Scaleway Private Network after its creation.

This means that to resolve the conflict, one or more of the Private Networks involved in the overlap must be [deleted](), and [recreated]() with a different CIDR block. You can define a custom CIDR block via the **Advanced Settings** when creating a Private Network via the console. Remember that you can use [IPAM](/ipam/) reserve specific private IP addresses on each Private Network, to use when attaching resources, if needed.
