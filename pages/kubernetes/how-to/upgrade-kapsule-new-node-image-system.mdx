import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'

Scaleway is introducing a new image system for Kubernetes Kapsule clusters, bringing significant improvements, including reduced boot time, faster autoscaling, and an updated Ubuntu version.

The advantages of the new image system include improved boot time, reduced from over five minutes to under one minute, and faster autoscaling. The new images are based on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, replacing the previous 22.04 LTS version.
Upgrades will also be faster, as nodes will be replaced instead of rebooted.

## Technical specifications of the upgrade process

* **Node replacement**: During upgrade, nodes will be replaced with new ones, **any local data will be lost**. Data stored in Persistent Volumes (PV) will not be affected.
* **New IP addresses**: The new replacement nodes will have new IP addresses (both public and private), which could impact IP filtering configurations.
* **GPU pool upgrade**: The upgrade of GPU pools may result in a partial downtime due to a limitation in the GPU operator, which cannot handle mixed Ubuntu versions (22.04 vs 24.04). The operator will install incorrect drivers on new nodes until the upgrade is complete, after which it will recover automatically.

<Requirements />

- [Created](/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/) a Kubernetes Kapsule cluster
- Installed the [Scaleway CLI](/scaleway-cli/quickstart/) on your local machine

## Upgrade methods

You can upgrade your Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule cluster to the new image system using either the console or the CLI.

<Message type="important">
  During the upgrade process, all cluster nodes will be replaced with new ones.
  Any data stored locally on the nodes (for example, using `hostPath`) will be **permanently lost**.
  Data stored in **Persistent Volumes (PVs)** will **not** be affected.
</Message>

### Console upgrade

1. Navigate to **Kubernetes** under the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The Kubernetes dashboard displays.
2. Click the Kapsule cluster name you want to manage. The cluster information page displays.
3. Click **Actions** in the top right corner of the cluster information page. A pop-up menu displays.
4. Click **Upgrade cluster nodes image**. A pop-up displays.
5. Click **Upgrade cluster node image** to confirm.

### CLI upgrade:
You can also upgrade the cluster to the new pool image system using the CLI.

Example of commands:
* Migrate all pools of a cluster to new images:
    ```
    scw k8s pool migrate-to-new-images cluster-id=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
    ```
* Migrate a specific pool of a cluster to new images:
    ```
    scw k8s pool migrate-to-new-images cluster-id=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111 pools-ids.0=22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222
    ```

<Message type="note">
  Forced migration to the new system will be scheduled by region for customers who have not upgraded before the dates below:

  * WAW Region: Starting December 1, 2025 (Week 49)
  * AMS Region: Starting December 2, 2025 (Week 49)
  * PAR Region: Between December 8, 2025 and December 11, 2025 (Week 50)
