If you encounter issues when connecting to your Scaleway account, there are several procedures you can follow to make sure you can log in securely.

## Unrecognized IP address error
When logging into your Scaleway account, you may encounter the following message:

<Lightbox image={image} alt="" />

This means you tried to log into your account from an unknown [IP address](/public-gateways/concepts/#ip-address). You may be logging in from a new device or location. As a security measure, we require you to use an [authentication code](/account/how-to/log-in-to-the-console/) to complete authentication.

1. Check your inbox for the latest email sent by the Scaleway team.
2. Click the **Authenticate myself** button in the email.

You are redirected to the Scaleway console and safely logged into your Scaleway account.

<Message type="note">
If [MFA](/account/concepts/#multifactor-authentication-mfa) is enforced for your account, you must also enter the security code received by SMS or provided by an authenticator smartphone app.
</Message>


## I have forgotten my password

If you forgot or lost your password, you need to reset it. There are several methods to recover it:
  - [Passwordless authentication using an authentication code](/account/how-to/log-in-to-the-console/)
  - [Password reset using email validation](/account/how-to/recover-a-lost-password/#reset-your-password-using-email-validation)
  - [Password recovery in case of lost email account](/account/how-to/recover-a-lost-password/#recover-your-password-if-you-lost-access-to-your-email-account)

## I have lost my 2FA device

Refer to the [How to use two-factor authentication (MFA)](/account/how-to/use-2fa/) page to find the instructions to recover access to your MFA device.

Remember that if you lose both your MFA device and backup codes, you will need to gather all the following information:

* Email address
* Postal address
* If your account is:
  - an individual account, a document proving your identity (passport or local ID card)
  - a corporate account, a copy of a business registration certificate,
   and a certified translation in either English or French if the document was issued in another language
* A phone number to contact you
* Copy of your last Scaleway invoice or the amount charged if you do not have a copy
* A card or bank statement showing your Scaleway invoice debit

Once you have gathered all the required documents, the request has to be sent by email to: `document@scaleway.com`.

## SSO authentication is not working

If the email address of your Google, Microsoft, or GitHub account does not match the email address associated with your Scaleway account, you will not be able to log in using SSO. Make sure both email addresses are the same.
