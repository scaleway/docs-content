Rescue mode allows you to boot an [Elastic Metal server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/elastic-metal/) from the network. It loads a rescue operating system based on [Ubuntu Linux](https://ubuntu.com/) that runs entirely in the server's RAM. This enables you to perform maintenance and data recovery operations, even if the machine is otherwise unreachable in its normal mode.

<Message type="note">
  This documentation specifically covers rescue mode for [Elastic Metal servers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/elastic-metal/). If you need to use rescue mode on [Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/), please refer to the corresponding [documentation](/compute/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes/#how-to-use-rescue-mode).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An Elastic Metal server [installed](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/quickstart/#how-to-create-an-elastic-metal-server)


1. Click **Elastic Metal** in the **Bare Metal** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. This opens the Elastic Metal dashboard.

2. Select the machine you want to reboot into rescue mode from the list of your Elastic Metal servers. Click the server's name to access its information page.

3. Scroll down to the **Rescue mode** section and click **Boot in rescue mode** to start the reboot process.

    <Message type="important">
      Rebooting your server may result in data corruption if there are unwritten files. The server's software will not be stopped before the reboot, so only use this feature when your server is not reachable over the internet.
    </Message>

    <Message type="tip">
      Depending on your server's hardware model, the reboot process may take several minutes.
    </Message>

4. After the server has rebooted, use a terminal application to log into the server via SSH using the credentials provided in your console:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-elastic-metal-rescue-credentials.webp" alt="Elastic Metal Rescue Mode Credentials Information" />

    ```
    ssh rescue@<elastic-metal-server>
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      Rescue mode uses the SSH keys registered for your Elastic Metal server for authentication. You can log in using the `rescue` user and your SSH key. If you have lost your private key, you can still access your server using the password displayed in the console.
    </Message>

You are now logged into rescue mode and can perform maintenance tasks on the server. Rescue mode is based on Ubuntu, so you can execute commands as you would on any Ubuntu Linux system.

  Rescue mode runs entirely in the server's RAM. To access files on the hard disk, you need to mount it.

## Rebooting back to normal mode

After completing maintenance, you can reboot the server back into its normal operating system.

To do this, click **Switch to normal mode** in the rescue mode section of the server's details page. The server will reboot into its installed operating system and should be available in normal mode within a few minutes.
