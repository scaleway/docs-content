Edge Services is an additional feature for Scaleway Load Balancers and Object Storage buckets. It provides a [caching service](/network/edge-services/how-to/configure-cache/) to improve performance by reducing load on your [origin](#origin), and a customizable and secure [endpoint](#endpoint) for accessing content via Edge Services, which can be set to a subdomain of your choice.

To use Edge Services, you must take out a subscription plan, which then enables you to create a certain number of Edge Services pipelines towards your Load Balancer origins or Object Storage buckets.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-services-pipeline.webp" alt="A diagram shows the elements and workflow of an Edge Services pipeline.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created either a [Load Balancer](/network/load-balancer/how-to/create-load-balancer/) or an [Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)

## How to subscribe to Edge Services

To use Edge Services, you must subscribe to a [pricing plan](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/network/#edge-services). Within its monthly price, each pricing plan includes a fixed number of pipelines, and a certain amount of egress cache data. Any consumption that exceeds the limits of the plan is charged at an additional rate. 

Find out more about how Edge Service subscription plans and billing works on our [Understanding Edge Services pricing](/network/edge-services/reference-content/understanding-pricing/) page, or follow the steps below to subscribe.

1. Click **Edge Services** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu.

2. Click **Subscribe to Edge Services**. Information about available [pricing plans](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/network/#edge-services) is displayed. 

3. Select a plan, and click **Subscribe to Edge Services**.

    Your subscription is created, and you are returned to the Edge Services dashboard, on the **Pipelines** tab. All your Edge Services pipelines will display here.

## How to create an Edge Services pipeline

You can create [pipelines](/network/edge-services/concepts/#pipeline) for either Object Storage buckets or Load Balancer origins.

1. Click **Edge Services** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu.

2. Click **Create pipeline**. The pipeline creation wizard displays.

3. Choose an **origin type**, the type of resource which Edge Services will connect to to fetch content to serve. This can either be **Load Balancer** or **Object Storage**. 

    Follow the steps below depending on whether you are creating a Load Balancer or Object Storage pipeline<br/>

    <Tabs id="edge-services-quickstart">
      <TabsTab label="Load Balancer">

        <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-create-pipeline-lb.webp" alt="A screenshot of the Scaleway console shows the Edge Services pipeline creation wizard. It prompts you to select an origin type (Load Balancer or Object Storage), and configure the other options described below on this page." />

        4. Configure the [origin](/network/edge-services/concepts/#origin) for this pipeline:
            - Select **Load Balancer** as the origin type.
            - Select the **origin Load Balancer** from the dropdown list. The Edge Services pipeline will connect to this Load Balancer when requesting content.
            - Select a **frontend** associated with the origin Load Balancer from the dropdown list. The Edge Services pipeline will connect to the Load Balancer on this port when requesting content. We recommend that you select an HTTPS port, e.g. `443`. Note that if you are creating multiple pipelines for the same origin Load Balancer, each one must be configured for a different frontend.

            <Message type="tip">
            For Kubernetes Load Balancers, see our [dedicated documentation](#help-for-kubernetes-load-balancers) for help selecting the correct Load Balancer and frontend.

            </Message>

        5. Define the protocol and origin host for this pipeline:
            - Select the protocol that Edge Services should use when making requests to the origin, either `HTTP` or `HTTPS` (recommended). Choose the protocol that corresponds with your Load Balancer setup.
            - Optionally, enter an [origin host](/network/edge-services/concepts/#origin-host) associated with your Load Balancer for this pipeline. When specified, this host replaces the Load Balancer IP address in the HTTP Host Header of the requests made from Edge Services to your Load Balancer.

        6. Enter a name for this Edge Services pipeline, or leave the auto-generated name in place.

        7. Check the summary cost for the pipeline, and click **Create Edge Services pipeline**.

      </TabsTab>
      <TabsTab label="Object Storage">

      <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-create-pipeline-os.webp" alt="A screenshot of the Scaleway console shows the Edge Services pipeline creation wizard. It prompts you to select an origin type (Load Balancer or Object Storage), origin bucket, and choose a name for the pipeline." />

        4. Select **Object Storage** as the origin type.

        5. Choose the bucket you want this pipeline to serve content for, under **Origin bucket**.

        6. Enter a name for the pipeline, or leave the randomly generated name in place.

        7. Check the summary cost for the pipeline, and click **Create Edge Services pipeline**.

        <Message type="important">
        Your bucket's [visibility](/storage/object/concepts/#visibility) can be set to **private**, but any objects within it that you want to expose via Edge Services must be set to [**public** visibility](/storage/object/how-to/manage-object-visibility/). However, in the case that you are using Edge Services with bucket website, objects can remain private.
        </Message>

      </TabsTab>
    </Tabs>

    You are returned to the **Pipelines** tab, where the newly created pipeline now displays. Click on the pipeline to go to its **Overview** page and start configuration.

## How to configure a custom domain

If you already own a domain, you can customize an Edge Services pipeline endpoint with a subdomain of your choice, e.g. `subdomain.mydomain.com`. This means you can access your Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer origin through Edge Services via your own subdomain rather than the standardized Edge Services endpoint.

1. In the Scaleway console, navigate to the Edge Services dashboard for the Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer pipeline whose domain you want to customize:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-services-dashboard.webp" alt="A screenshot of the Edge Services dashboard in the Scaleway console. This is a dashboard for Edge Services on an Object Storage bucket, showing links to the documentation, Scaleway Cockpit, the endpoint, cache settings and a button to disable the pipeline." />

2. In the **Endpoint** panel, click **Configure domain**. The following screen displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-configure-domain.webp" alt="A screenshot of the Configure Domain screen in the Edge Services part of the Scaleway console. Step one is to set a subdomain, step two is to provide an SSL/TLS certificate" />

3. Set a subdomain from which your Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer origin will be accessible via its Edge Services pipeline. You must already own the primary domain. For example, if you own `beautiful-domain.com`, choose any subdomain you like and enter `my-chosen-subdomain.beautiful-domain.com` into the box.

    <Message type="important">
    It is **not** possible to use only a root domain (aka primary domain or apex domain), you must use a subdomain. This is because CNAME records, essential to point your domain to your Edge Services endpoint, cannot by definition be created for root domains, only for subdomains.

    </Message>

4. This step depends on whether the domain used in the previous step is managed with [Scaleway Domains and DNS](/network/domains-and-dns/), or an external domain provider. Choose the appropriate tab below.

    <Tabs id="edge-cname">
    
        <TabsTab label="Domains and DNS">
        The domain you are using for Edge Services is considered to be managed with Scaleway Domains and DNS if:
        - You [registered the domain](/network/domains-and-dns/how-to/register-internal-domain/) with Domains and DNS, or
        - You [transferred an externally-registered domain](/network/domains-and-dns/how-to/transfer-external-domain/) to Domains and DNS

        If either of the above is true, Scaleway will auto-detect that the domain is managed by Domains and DNS, and a message will display confirming that you do not need to create a CNAME record. We will auto-generate the appropriate CNAME record in your domain's [DNS records](/network/domains-and-dns/how-to/manage-dns-records/), to point your subdomain to the Edge Services endpoint. This record is generated when you click `Customize domain` in step 6.

        You should not attempt to modify or delete the CNAME record, which will be visible among your [DNS records](/network/domains-and-dns/how-to/manage-dns-records/) in the Scaleway console.
        </TabsTab>

        <TabsTab label="External provider">
        Scaleway cannot itself create the appropriate CNAME record to point your subdomain to Edge Services if your domain is managed by an external provider. You must create the CNAME record yourself.

        Log in to your domain provider, and locate the DNS settings for your domain. Create a new CNAME record pointing your subdomain to the Edge Services pipeline endpoint displayed in the Scaleway console. For help setting up CNAME records and troubleshooting any problems, [check out our dedicated documentation](/network/edge-services/reference-content/cname-record/).

        Back in the Scaleway console, click the `Verify CNAME` button to check whether your CNAME record has been correctly configured. Edge Services will carry out a check, and if it is successful the following message displays:

        <Lightbox src="scaleway-cname-success.webp" alt="Verification passed: Your DNS record has been correctly configured" />

        If the check fails, an error message will display. See the documentation linked above for help troubleshooting such errors. Note that it may take a short time for the DNS record to be propagated and the check to pass.
        </TabsTab>
    </Tabs>

5. Provide an SSL/TLS certificate for your subdomain so that Edge Services can serve traffic for it over HTTPS. You have three options for this:
    - Generate a free Let's Encrypt certificate, managed by Scaleway, including automatic renewals.
    - Select an existing certificate that you have stored in [Scaleway Secret Manager](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/quickstart/).
    - Manually import a certificate into Scaleway Secret Manager:
      - Enter a name for your certificate (alphanumeric characters only)
      - Optionally, add tags by typing each tag and then pressing enter
      - Copy and paste the full PEM-formatted certificate chain into the box.
      Your certificate will be automatically stored in Secret Manager and [billed accordingly](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/security-and-account/).

    <Message type="tip">
    For help with SSL/TLS certificates for Edge Services, and/or dealing with any errors you encounter importing a certificate into Secret Manager, see our [dedicated documentation](/network/edge-services/reference-content/ssl-tls-certificate/).
    </Message>

6. Click **Customize domain** to finish.

Your customized domain is set up, and you are returned to the Edge Services dashboard. The customized domain displays in the Endpoint panel. When you access your Object Storage or Load Balancer origin through this domain, its content will be served via Edge Services.

## How to configure your cache

The cache feature allows you to cache your origin's content with Edge Services. This means that content can be served directly to users from Edge Services' servers, instead of from your Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer origin, enhancing performance.

You can disable and enable caching at will, as well as control the lifetime of an object in the cache. You can also purge your entire cache, or specific objects within it. A log is displayed to help you track your purge events.

1. In the Scaleway console, navigate to the Edge Services dashboard for the Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer pipeline for which you want to enable caching:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-services-dashboard.webp" alt="A screenshot of the Edge Services dashboard in the Scaleway console. This is a dashboard for Edge Services on an Object Storage bucket, showing links to the documentation, Scaleway Cockpit, the endpoint, cache settings and a button to disable the pipeline." />

2. In the **Cache** panel, use the <Icon name="toggle" /> icon to enable the cache.

    The **Lifetime** configuration box displays. This enables you to define, in seconds, how long an object can be stored in the cache before it must be retrieved freshly from the origin (Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer).

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-services-cache.webp" />

    <Message type="tip">
    As an example, a value of 0 means that objects will not be cached, unless they have a separately-defined caching directive. Note that in any case, if an object has a caching directive, the caching directive always takes precedence over any lifetime setting defined here in Edge Services.
    </Message>

3. Leave the default value of 1 hour in place, or enter another value.

The cache is now enabled.

For information on purging your cache, see our [dedicated documentation](/network/edge-services/how-to/configure-cache/).

## How to delete an Edge Services pipeline

1. Click **Edge Services** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Pipelines** tab displays.

2. Click the pipeline that you want to delete. You are taken to the pipeline's **Overview** page

4. In the **Delete Edge Services pipeline** panel at the bottom of the screen, click **Delete Edge Services pipeline**.

    A pop-up displays, asking you to confirm that you want to delete the pipeline.
      - The Load Balancer/Object Storage bucket will no longer be accessible via its Edge Services endpoint, or any customized domains pointing to this endpoint.
      - Any files stored in the Edge Services cache will be removed.
    
    <Message type="tip">
    Remember to:
        - Delete any CNAME records created for this pipeline from your domain provider, unless your domain is managed with Scaleway Domains and DNS, in which case we take care of deletion for you.
        - Delete any SSL/TLS certificates you imported into Secret Manager for this pipeline (if no longer required elsewhere), so that you are no longer billed for them. If you generated a managed Let's Encrypt certificate however, Scaleway takes care of the deletion for you.
    </Message>

5. Click **Confirm**.

    The Edge Services pipeline is deleted. You can create a new pipeline for this origin at any time, but you will need to reconfigure your custom domain, and the cache will initially be empty.

## How to terminate an Edge Services subscription

You can terminate your Edge Services subscription at any time, as long as you have deleted all your pipelines. You will be charged pro-rata for the month you cancel, based on how many days in that month your subscription was active.

1. Click **Edge Services** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. Your Edge Services dashboard displays.

2. Click the **Plans** tab. An overview of your current plan displays, along with options to manage your plan or terminate your subscription.

3. Scroll down to the **Terminate subscription** section, and click **Terminate subscription**. 

    A pop-up displays, asking you to confirm that you want to terminate your subscription.

4. Type **DELETE** in the box, and click **Terminate** to confirm.

    Your Edge Services subscription is terminated. You can subscribe again at any time.
