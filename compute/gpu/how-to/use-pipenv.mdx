Pipenv is a package and dependency manager for Python projects. It harnesses the power of different existing tools, bringing their functionalities together: 
  - **pip** for Python package management
  - **pyenv** for Python version management
  - **Virtualenv** for creating different virtual Python environments
  - **Pipfile** for managing project dependencies

Pipenv is preinstalled on all of Scaleway's AI Docker images for GPU Instances. Launching one of these Docker images puts you in an activated pipenv virtual environment, with all your favorite packages and tools preinstalled. You can also use pipenv to create your own virtual environments, if you wish to go beyond the preinstalled Python environments already provided with the various Docker images.

## Accessing the pipenv virtual environment

See our [dedicated documentation](/compute/gpu/how-to/use-preinstalled-env/#working-with-the-pre-installed-environment-on-ubuntu-focal-gpu-os11) on how to access the pipenv virtual environment from your Scaleway GPU Instance.

## Managing packages with pipenv

You can view packages, install/uninstall packages and update packages with a few simple `pipenv` commands:

1. Enter the following command to see all the packages and dependencies installed in this environment, and their versions:

    `pipenv graph`
2. Enter the following command to install a new package:

    `pipenv install <package>`

    <Message type="tip">
      To install a specific version of a package, use the command `pipenv install <package>~=1.2`
    </Message>
3. Enter the following command to uninstall a package:

    `pipenv uninstall <package>`
4. Enter the following command to update a package:

    `pipenv update <package>`

    <Message type="tip">
      To update all packages, simply run `pipenv update`
    </Message>

    <Message type="important">
      Be aware that installing and updating packages may provoke conflicts with the existing virtual environment installation.
    </Message>

## Understanding Pipfiles

Every pipenv virtual environment has its own Pipfile. The Pipfile details the dependencies of the project, taking the place of the typical `requirements.txt` file. When you create a Pipenv environment, a Pipfile is automatically generated.

1. From within the Docker container, in the `~/ai` directory, type `ls` to list all files in this directory

    The output should be similar to the following:

    ```
    Pipfile  Pipfile.lock
    ```
2. Enter the command `cat Pipfile` to view the contents of Pipfile. The following information will help you understand the output:
    - `source` specifies the sources where available packages are added/installed from 
    - `packages` lists the packages required for the project (production and development environments)
    - `dev-packages` lists the packages required for the project (development environments only)
    - `requires` specifies the required python version for the project

    Any packages that you explicitly install with the command `pipenv install <package>` will automatically be added to the Pipfile. If you push your project to a Git repository, other users who clone it will be able to install all dependencies, based on the Pipfile, with the command `pipenv install`.
3. Enter the command `cat Pipfile.lock` to view the contents of Pipfile.lock.

    This file specifies which specific versions of the packages in the Pipfile should be used. This prevents packages which depend on each other being automatically upgraded, which could break your project dependency tree.

## Creating your own virtual environments

1. Ensure you have [connected to your GPU Instance via SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance) and then [launched a Scaleway AI Docker container](/compute/gpu/how-to/use-gpu-with-docker). 

    You are now in the `~/ai` directory of the Docker container, with the virtual environment activated.
2. Type `exit` to exit the virtual environment.
3. Type `cd ~` to leave the `~/ai` directory and go to the home directory.
4. Create a new project directory for your new virtual environment, and navigate into it. Replace `my-proj` with the desired name for your project.

    `mkdir my-proj && cd my-proj`

    <Message type="tip">
      To avoid losing your virtual environment upon exiting the container, make sure you create this folder in a directory that is [mapped to one of your GPU Instance's local volumes](/compute/gpu/how-to/use-gpu-with-docker#how-to-map-local-volumes)
    </Message>
5. Create a new virtual environment and generate a Pipfile:

    `pipenv install`
6. Activate the virtual environment:

    `pipenv shell`

    Your command prompt should now be similar to `(my-proj) jovyan@442a38468c20:~/my-proj`, showing that you are in the activated `my-proj` pipenv virtual environment.
