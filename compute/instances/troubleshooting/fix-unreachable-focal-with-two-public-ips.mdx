When using an Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Instance with more than one routed IP address, the Instance will become unreachable after a reboot. This may happen when you attach a second routed IPv4 or IPv6 IP address to the Instance.

The version of `systemd-networkd` used in Ubuntu Focal does not support the definition of a default route which is not part of the subnet of the network interface. The `on-link: true` option must be added to the netplan profile.

A modified `cloud-init` package named `cloud-init_24.2-0ubuntu1~20.04.1+scaleway` has been added to Scaleway's stable PPA to work around this situation.

## Your Instance has not been rebooted

1. Add Scaleway's stable PPA

```sh
add-apt-repository ppa:scaleway/stable
```
2. Add the modified cloud-init package

```sh
apt -y install cloud-init
```
3. Re-initialize cloud-init to fix the netplan profile
```sh
cloud-init clean
cloud-init init --local
cloud-init init
```
From this point on, your Instance may be safely rebooted and you will no longer lose connectivity.

## Your Instance has rebooted and is no longer reachable

[Rescue mode](/compute/instances/concepts/#rescue-mode) allows you to boot your Instance into a temporary operating system, running from the Instance's RAM. Rescue mode is often used to diagnose and resolve issues such as faulty kernel configurations, networking issues, firewall configurations, and more.

1. Switch the Instance's `boot-type` to `rescue` and reboot your Instance into rescue mode using the [CLI](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/developer-tools/scaleway-cli/quickstart/):
```
scw instance server stop <Instance_ID>
# Wait for the instance to be stopped.
scw instance server update <Instance_ID> boot-type=rescue
scw instance server start <Instance_ID>
```
<Message type="note">
    Replace `<Instance_ID>` with the unique ID of your Instance, e.g. `0500ebd2-d70d-49af-a969-3ac09b6f7fff`.
</Message>

2. Once the Instance is rebooted, log into your Instance using [SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/) and set up the environment to be able to chroot into it:
```sh
cat /proc/partitions
major minor #blocks name

7        0      65480 loop0
7        1      89120 loop1
7        2      39760 loop2
252      0   19531250 vda
252      1   19417569 vda1
252     14       4096 vda14
252     15     108544 vda15
8        0    9765625 sda
8        1    3240943 sda1
8       14       4096 sda14
8       15     108544 sda15

```
Then mount the partitions and get into the `chroot`:

```sh
mount /dev/vda1 /mnt
mount -o bind /sys /mnt/sys
mount -o bind /proc /mnt/proc
mount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev
mount -o bind /run /mnt/run
chroot /mnt
```
3. Fix the DNS resolution file in the chroot
```sh
rm -f /etc/resolv.conf
ln -s run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
```
4. Once in the `chroot` install the modified cloud-init package
```
add-apt-repository ppa:scaleway/stable
apt -y install cloud-init
```
5. Re-initialize cloud-init to fix the netplan profile
```sh
cloud-init clean && cloud-init init --local && cloud-init init
```
6. Get out of the `chroot` and remove the mounts
```sh
umount /mnt/sys /mnt/proc /mnt/dev /mnt/run /mnt
```
7. Stop the Instance, switch back the Instance's `boot_type` to `local`, and reboot the Instance:
```
scw instance server stop <Instance_ID>
# Wait for the instance to be stopped
scw instance server update <Instance_ID> boot-type=local
scw instance server start <Instance_ID>
```
Once rebooted, your Instance will be reachable again.

   This modification will be valid for up until Ubuntu publishes a new version, i.e. cloud-init 24.3. You can use the following commands to hold the newly installed version so it does not get updated when the new version comes in.
</Message>

8. Put a hold on the newly installed cloud-init
```sh
apt-mark hold cloud-init
cloud-init set on hold.
```
