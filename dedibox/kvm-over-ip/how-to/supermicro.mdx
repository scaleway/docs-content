## Installing Windows network drivers

Microsoft Windows Server does not support the network adapter used in Supermicro servers by default. Follow these steps to manually install network drivers using the KVM-over-IP device:

1. [Create](#creating-a-kvm-session) a Supermicro KVM session.
2. Open the connection URL of the KVM in your web browser and log in using the provided credentials.
3. [Download](https://www.supermicro.com/wdl/CDR_Images/CDR-A1-A2-UP/CDR-A1-A2-UP_1.02_for_Intel_A1_A2_UP_platform.iso.iso) the driver package from Supermicro to your local computer.

      You can also download a local copy of the file directly onto your server using Scaleway's NAS: [https://virtualmedia.online.net/supermicro/CDR-A1-UP_1.00_for_Intel_A1_UP_platform.iso](https://virtualmedia.online.net/supermicro/CDR-A1-UP_1.00_for_Intel_A1_UP_platform.iso).
