- Our new TEM sending Domain is now available: scw-tem.cloud: new clients will use this sending domain by default, existing clients can change to the new sending domain by modifying the SPF record on the console and then deleting the old SPF record.

- Emails with error code 452 (i.e. recipientâ€™s mailbox is full) will be deleted after the first attempt to send.

- A minimum number of characters is now required in an email to avoid spam: the email subject and body fields must contain a minimum number of characters in order to avoid spam. The email subject must contain at least 6 characters, and the email body must contain at least 10 characters.
