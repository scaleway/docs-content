A hardware RAID is a type of [RAID](/dedibox/hardware/concepts/#raid) implementation where construction and management of the RAID is performed on dedicated hardware, independently from the operating system.

The logical disks of the RAID array are managed by a physical controller, sitting on the PCI bus, which presents only the logical volumes to the operating system. The RAID controller manages the RAID using its own CPU and RAM, without delegating tasks to the main CPU of the machine.

1. Log in to the [Scaleway Dedibox console](https://console.online.net/en/login).
2. Click on **Server** > **Server list** to display a list of available servers in the account.
3. Select the server to install and click **Manage**.
4. Click **RAID configuration** in the menu.
5. Choose the RAID level for the server from the drop-down list and confirm by clicking **ERASE ALL MY DATA AND PROCEED TO RAID LEVEL CHANGES**.
    <Message type="important">
      This will delete all the data in the server's disks. Make sure you have backed up your data before changing the RAID level of the machine.
    </Message>
6. Proceed with the reinstallation of the operating system from the console.
