Scaleway NATS is a managed message broker tool that allows you to transfer messages between different microservices and platforms. This enables them to "talk" to each other effectively even if they are not otherwise compatible. This enables and simplifies microservices application development and allows you to build highly scalable, reliable, distributed applications.

Scaleway NATS was previously part of our Messaging and Queuing product, and has now become a product in its own right.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to create a NATS account

To start using a NATS message broker, you must first create a NATS account. This sets a scope for your NATS credentials, messages, queues and stream.

1. Click **NATS** in the **Data and Analytics** section of the Scaleway console side menu. 

2. Click **Create a NATS account**. The creation wizard displays.

    <Lightbox image={image} alt="In the Scaleway console, the Create a NATS Account screen displays. The different parts of the page are detailed in the steps below." />

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:

    - Choose a **region**, which is the geographical location in which your NATS account will be created.
    - Enter a **name** for your NATS account, or use the auto-generated name suggested for you.
    - Optional: Use the *Estimated cost** calculator to simulate how messages sent and stored with NATS streams will be billed. Note that simply creating a NATS account does not in itself incur any billing. For more information about NATS billing, see the [FAQ](/nats/faq/#how-is-scaleway-nats-billed).
    - Click **Create NATS account** to finish.

    You are directed to the listing of your NATS accounts, where your newly-created NATS account now appears.

## How to create NATS credentials

Credentials for NATS accounts are not granular: they necessarily give full read and write access. The bearer of these credentials can publish and receive messages, as well as manage topics and streams, for this account.

1. Click **NATS** in the **Data and Analytics** section of the Scaleway console side menu. 

2. Use the drop-down menu to select the [region](/nats/concepts/#region) of the NATS account for which you want to create credentials. The list of your NATS accounts in the pre-selected region displays.

3. Click the NATS account you want to generate credentials for. The account's **Overview** page displays.

    <Lightbox image={image2} alt="In the Scaleway console, the Overview tab of a NATS account is displayed. Three panels are visible: account information (URL and region), Credentials, adn Delete NATS account." />

4. In the **Credentials** panel, click **Generate credentials**. A pop-up displays.

5. Enter a name for these credentials, and click **Generate credentials**.

    The credentials are created and a button displays prompting you to download them in a `.creds` file.

    <Lightbox image={image3} alt="In the Scaleway console, a screen shows that a .creds key file has been generated, which the user is prompted to download." />
    
    <Message type="important">
      The generated credentials are displayed only once. Make sure to download and safely store them before closing the window.
    </Message>

6. Click **Download** and save the file, before closing the window.

    You are returned to your NATs account's overview page. The name of your newly-generated credentials and their access level is displayed in the **Credentials** panel.

## How to create and manage queues, messages and streams

All further actions related to publishing, processing and managing messages, subjects, queues and streams can be done via a supported CLI or SDK. See our documentation on [NATS CLI and SDKs](/nats/reference-content/nats-overview/#further-actions-nats-cli-and-nats-sdk) for more information. You can also check out our tutorial on [creating a serverless architecture for handling large messages](/tutorials/large-messages/) with Scaleway NATS.

## How to delete a NATS account

1. Click **NATS** in the **Data and Analytics** section of the Scaleway console side menu.

2. Use the drop-down menu to select the [region](/nats/concepts/#region) containing the NATS account you want to delete.

3. Click the NATS account you want to delete.

4. In the bottom panel, click the **Delete NATS account** button.

    A pop-up displays, reminding you that the action is irreversible, and any associated queued messages and credentials will be deleted.

5. Type `DELETE` and click **Delete NATS account** to confirm.
