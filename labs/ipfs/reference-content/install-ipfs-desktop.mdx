With Scaleway IPFS pinning, you can permanently store your data on the public IPFS network. You can either [create](/labs/ipfs/api-cli/volumes-operations) and manage your volume via the [Kubo client](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/command-line/) or through [IPFS Desktop](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop/).
