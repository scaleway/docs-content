This page shows you how to manually run a Serverless Job from the Scaleway console.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created a job](/serverless/jobs/how-to/create-job-from-scaleway-registry/)
</Message>

1. Click **Jobs** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The Serverless Jobs page displays.

2. Click the name of the job you want to run. The job **Overview** tab displays.

3. Click the **Run job** button. A new entry appears in the **Job runs** section.

The **Job runs** section contains basic monitoring information for your jobs:

- A status, that can be `queued`, `ongoing`, `canceled`, or `succeeded`
- A unique identifier (UID)
- A start date and an end date
- The duration of the job execution

<Message type="tip">
  Use [Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/quickstart/) for in-depth monitoring of the activity of your serverless jobs.
