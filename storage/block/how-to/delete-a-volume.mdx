  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
  - You have [created](/storage/block/how-to/create-a-volume/) a Block Storage volume
</Message>

<Message type="important">
  - You must detach your volume from the Instance it is linked to. Refer to our documenation to find out [how to do so](/storage/block/how-to/detach-a-volume/).
  - We highly recommend that you [unmount](/storage/block/api-cli/unmounting-a-volume/) your device from the operating system before detaching the Block Storage volume, to avoid data loss.

1. Click **Block Storage** in the **Storage** section of the Scaleway Console side menu. A list of your volumes displays.

3. Type `DELETE` to confirm.
4. Click **Delete volume** to remove the volume from your account.
    <Message type="important">
      This action permanently deletes your volume and all the data it contains. If you do not want to lose this data, make a backup before deleting the volume.
