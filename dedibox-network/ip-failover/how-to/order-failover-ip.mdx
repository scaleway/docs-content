Failover IP addresses allow you to have multiple IPs on a server, enabling you to assign a unique IP to each website or virtual machine.
Each failover IP can be routed to your servers at any time in just a few minutes using our Account Management Console or API. 
By switching a failover IP addresses from one server to another, your hosted services remain available without the need to reconfigure the IP address.

<Message type="note">
  - For each server, you can add failover IP addresses according to your service plan and service level.
  - Dedibox failover IPs are compatible only with Dedibox servers and cannot be assigned to other products such as Elastic Metal servers or Instances.
