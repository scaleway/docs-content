IPAM acts as a single source of truth for the IP addresses of your Scaleway resources. You can use IPAM in the console Scaleway console to manage [private IP addresses](/network/ipam/concepts/#private-ip-address) that are either attached to one of your resources on a Private Network, or [reserved via the IPAM API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/ipam/#path-ips-book-a-new-ip).

The management actions currently available include:
- Viewing the details of a private IP address, including its ID, tags, creation date and to which resource (if any) it is attached
- Editing the tags of a private IP address

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- At least one resource [attached to a Private Network](/network/vpc/how-to/attach-resources-to-pn/).

## How to view the details of a private IP address

1. Click **IPAM** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu.

    A list of your **private IP addresses** for the **region** and **VPC** pre-selected in the filters displays. Addresses are displayed here if they are reserved in IPAM (either manually reserved via the [IPAM API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/ipam/#path-ips-book-a-new-ip)), or attached to a resource [on a Private Network](/network/vpc/how-to/attach-resources-to-pn/).

2. Modify the filters of the list using the drop-down menus at the top if necessary to display the required IP address.

3. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the IP address whose details you want to view, then click **More info**.

    A screen similar to the following displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-ipam-moreinfo.webp" alt=""/>

    You can view the following information:
    - The IP address
    - The **region** of the IP address
    - Which **resource** (if any) it is attached to
    - The **ID** of the IP address
    - The date on which the IP was **created**. This corresponds to the date it was reserved in IPAM, either via a manual [API reservation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/ipam/#path-ips-book-a-new-ip) or when it was attached to a resource on a Private Network.
    - The date on which the IP was last **updated**
    - The **tags** associated with the IP address.

4. Click **OK** to exit the screen.

## How to edit the tags of a private IP address

Tags help you organize your IPAM IP addresses. You can assign as many tags as you want to each reserved IP, and use them for identification and sorting purposes.

1. Follow steps 1 to 3 [above](#how-to-view-the-details-of-a-private-ip-address).

2. Click into the **Tags** box, and type the tag(s) you want to add. Alternatively, click the **x** symbol to remove any existing tags.

3. Click **OK** to exit the screen.
