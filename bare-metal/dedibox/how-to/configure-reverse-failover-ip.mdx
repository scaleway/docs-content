  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net)
  - You have performed the [linking process](/bare-metal/dedibox/how-to/link-dedibox-account/) between Dedibox and Scaleway

You can edit the reverse DNS of a failover IP address to a custom value. This can be useful when you want to send email from your Dedibox, as certain remote mail servers do not accept mails coming from generic reverse hostnames. 

1. Click **Dedibox** in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu.
2. Click the **Failover IPs** tab to display a list of your failover IPs.
3. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the failover IP you want to edit. A drop-down menu displays.
4. Click **Edit reverse**. A pop-up displays.

    <Message type="tip">
      You can click <Icon name="more" /> next to the IP you want to configure in the listing of the failover IPs in the left.
    </Message>
5. Enter a new IPv4 reverse DNS and click **Save changes**.
    <Message type="important">
      Make sure that a valid and corresponding A-Record is set for the reverse DNS you want to configure. 
    </Message>

The reverse DNS (PTR-Record) of the failover IP is being updated.
