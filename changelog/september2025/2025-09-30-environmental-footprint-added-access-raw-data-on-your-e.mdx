We have released a new API that gives you programmatic, fine-grained access to your usage data. You can now retrieve detailed environmental impact metrics, such as carbon emissions (kgCO₂e) and water consumption (m³), in raw JSON format.

Get started and [read the documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/environmental-footprint/user-api/).
