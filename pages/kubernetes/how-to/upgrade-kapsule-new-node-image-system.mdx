Scaleway is introducing a new image system for Kubernetes Kapsule clusters, bringing significant improvements, including reduced boot time, faster autoscaling, and an updated Ubuntu version.

The advantages of the new image system include improved boot time, reduced from over five minutes to under one minute, and faster autoscaling. The new images are based on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, replacing the previous 22.04 LTS version.
Upgrades will also be faster, as nodes will be replaced instead of rebooted.


## Technical specifics of the upgrade Process

* **Node replacement**: During upgrade, nodes will be replaced with new ones, which may have implications for data stored locally on nodes (e.g., `hostPath`). Data stored in persistent volumes (PV) will not be affected.
* **New IP addresses**: The new replacement nodes will have new IP addresses (both public and private), which could impact IP filtering configurations.
* **GPU pool upgrade**: The upgrade of GPU pools may result in a partial downtime due to a limitation in the GPU operator, which cannot handle mixed Ubuntu versions (22.04 vs 24.04). The operator will install incorrect drivers on new nodes until the upgrade is complete, after which it will recover automatically.

## Upgrade methods

You can upgrade your Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule cluster to the new image system using either the console or the CLI:

### Console upgrade

1. Navigate to **Kubernetes** under the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The Kubernetes dashboard displays.
2. Click the Kapsule cluster name you want to manage. The cluster information page displays.
3. Click **Actions** in the top right corner of the cluster information page. A pop-up menu displays.
4. Click **Upgrade cluster nodes image**. A pop-up dispalys.
5. Confirm the upgrade by clicking **Upgrade cluster node image**

### CLI upgrade :
You can also upgrade the cluster to the new pool image system using the CLI.

Example command:
* Migrate all pools of a cluster to new images: `scw k8s cluster migrate-to-new-images cluster-id=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111`
