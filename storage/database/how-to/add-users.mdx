Users can connect to a database and access its data. Each one has a different set of customizable permissions.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have a [Managed Database](/storage/database/concepts/#managed-database/)

</Message>

1. Click **Database** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database information page.
3. Go to the **Users** tab. A list of users displays. If it is the first time you create a user, your list will display the user you set up during the creation of your Database Instance.
4. Click <Icon name="plus" /> to create a new user, if you wish to.
5. Click <Icon name="toggle" /> to grant admin rights to the user.
  <Message type="note">

  Admin rights allow a user to create logical databases and users. These right do not override the permissions configured for the logical databases. Logical database permissions must be set up in the Permissions tab.

  </Message>

6. Enter the **Username** and **Password**.

  <Message type="note">

  Optionally, you can configure the appropriate permissions according to the user.
  Three types of permissions are available:
    - **None:** No access to the database
    - **Read:** Allow users to read tables and fields in a database
    - **Write:** Allow users to write content in databases
  You can select the permission type in the Permissions tab.

  </Message>
7. Click **Create a user** to confirm. 

Once the user is created, it is displayed in the user list.

To update the password, the permissions or delete the user, click <Icon name="more" /> to display the respective options.
