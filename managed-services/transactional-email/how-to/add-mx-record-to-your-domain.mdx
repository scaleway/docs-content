Setting up an MX record ensures that your emails are delivered reliably. This page explains how to set up Scaleway's [MX](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#mx-record) record.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />
 
<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/).
  - You have a domain name.
  - You have [configured your domain with Transactional Email](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/configure-domain-with-transactional-email).
  - You have [added SPF and DKIM records](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/add-spf-dkim-records-to-your-domain/) to your domain.
</Message>

<Message type="important">
  Scaleway provides its own MX server to improve email deliverability. <br></br> However, Scaleway's MX server is a **blackhole**. This means that **any email sent back to it, will be lost with no possibility of recovery**.
</Message>

1. Add an [MX record](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#mx-record) type in the root zone of your domain on your DNS zone.
2. Enter a name of your choice in the **Name** field.
3. Set `10` as a [priority](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#priority) for your MX record.
    <Message type="note">
     Priority indicates the order in which your mail servers should be tried by a mail server that is attempting to deliver emails.
    </Message>
4. Enter `blackhole.scw-tem.cloud.` in the **Hostname** field. Make sure you include a trailing dot in the Hostname field at the end.
    <Message type="tip">
     You can also enter your own MX if you have one.
    </Message>
5. Save your changes.

    <Message type="important">
    Your changes might take up to 48 hours to apply.
