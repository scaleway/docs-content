Regional API is now deprecated and is no longer maintained by the team. Zoned API must be used instead (https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/load-balancer/zoned-api/).
With the exception of zoning, this API is identical to the previous version.
 
When using this API through Kapsule, Terraform, the SCW CLI or another official open source tool, a tool update is required.
 
If you encounter any problems with this migration, don't hesitate to reply to this message, or contact us on the #load-balancer channel of the Scaleway Community Slack.
