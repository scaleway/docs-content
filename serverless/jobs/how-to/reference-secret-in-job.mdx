Serverless Jobs seamlessly integrates with [Secret Manager](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/), which allows you to store, manage, and access sensitive information, such as credentials, SSH keys, SSL/TLS certificates, or any key/value pairs you need to secure.

You can reference any secret stored in Secret Manager in a job, without having to hardcode any sensitive data.

A [job run](/serverless/jobs/concepts/#job-run) accesses each secret at startup, and each access generates a call to the Secret Manager API, which is billed accordingly. Refer to the [Secret Manager pricing](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager) for more information.

## Reference a secret in a job

1. Click **Jobs** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The jobs page displays.

2. Click the name of the job to which you want to add a secret, then open the **Settings** tab.

3. In the **Secrets references** section, click **+ Add secret reference**. A pop-up displays.

4. Select the secret you want to reference, and the desired version, then click **Select reference method**.

5. Select the desired reference method:

  - **File**: copies the encrypted value of your secret to a file stored at the indicated location within your container. This method is recommended for large or complex data. For example, if your secret is a certificate, you can store it as a file in the `/my-certificates` folder in your container.

  - **Environment variable**: passes the encrypted value of your secret to your job as a variable. This method is recommended for small pieces of information, such as passwords, or API secret keys. For example, if you name this variable `MY_SECRET`, calling `$MY_SECRET` in your container will return the value of the selected secret in a secure way.

6. Click **Add reference** to add the secret to your Serverless Job. Optionally, tick the **Add another reference** to add a new secret right away, then repeat steps 4 to 6.

The secret is now referenced in your Serverless Job, and can be used within the container.

## Update a secret reference from a job

1. Click **Jobs** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The jobs page displays.

2. Click the name of the job for which you want to update a secret, then open the **Settings** tab.

3. In the **Secret references** section, click the <Icon name="edit" /> icon next to the secret reference you want to update. A pop-up displays.

4. Update the secret version if needed, then click **Update** to save your changes, or click **Select reference method** to continue.

5. Either update the location of the file, or the name of the environment variable, then click **Update reference** to confirm your changes.

<Message type="note">
You cannot change the reference method of an existing secret. You have to delete the secret reference within the job first, then create it again with the desired reference method.

## Delete a secret reference from a job

1. Click **Jobs** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The jobs page displays.

2. Click the name of the job for which you want to delete a secret, then open the **Settings** tab.

3. In the **Secret references** section, click the <Icon name="delete" /> icon next to the secret reference you want to delete. A confirmation pop-up displays.

4. Click **Delete reference** to confirm.

The secret is no longer referenced in your Serverless Job.

<Message type="note">
Deleting a secret from the **Settings** tab of a job only deletes the secret reference, not the secret itself. To permanently delete a secret, follow [this procedure](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/how-to/delete-secret/).
