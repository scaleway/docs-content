- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

The action to take depends on whether the Private Network(s) your Instance is on have DHCP enabled, and whether your Public Gateway is set to advertise a default route (true by default).

If it is not the case, disconnect the Instance from the Private Network, as there may be other factors impacting your Instance, like one of your Instances running a DHCP server.

If DHCP is activated and your Public Gateway is set to advertise a default route, this is expected behavior as all the traffic towards your Instance now goes through the Public Gateway. To access your Instance using SSH, first create a static NAT association between a port of your Public Gateway (eg 2222) and the private IP assigned to your Instance, on the SSH port (22 by default). Then, SSH to the Public Gateway's IP on port 2222.
