Routes allow your IoT Hub to forward messages to non-MQTT destinations.

Currently, the following routes are available:

 - **REST route** allowing you to call a REST API with the content of your messages.
 - **Database route** allowing you execute queries on a PostgreSQL or MySQL database with the content of your messages.
 - **Scaleway Object Storage route** allowing you to store your messages in your Scaleway [Object Storage](https://www.scaleway.com/en/object-storage/) bucket.
