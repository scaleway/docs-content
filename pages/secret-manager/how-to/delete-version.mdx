This page explains how to [schedule](/secret-manager/concepts/#scheduled-deletion) a [version](/secret-manager/concepts/#version) deletion using the [Scaleway console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements).

Once you schedule a version for deletion, it enters a 7-day pending deletion period, during which you can still [recover it](/secret-manager/how-to/recover-version/). After this retention period, the version is permanently deleted.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Generated an API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) and enabled the `SecretManagerFullAccess` [permission set](/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/)
- Created a [secret](/secret-manager/how-to/create-secret/) and one or more [versions](/secret-manager/how-to/create-version/) for it

1. Click **Secret Manager** in the **Security and Identity** section of the [Scaleway console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements) side menu.
2. Select the [region](/secret-manager/concepts/#region) in which to delete the version, in the **Region** drop-down.
3. Access the secret for which you want to delete the version. Your secret's **Overview** tab displays.
4. Click the **Versions** tab.
5. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the version you want to delete.
6. Click **Delete**. A pop-up displays informing you that the action schedules the deletion of your version.
7. Type **DELETE** and click **Delete version**. Your version enters the **Scheduled for deletion** status for 7 days before being permanently deleted.

<Message type="important">
 Deleting a version is permanent. You will not be able to use the version again if you do not [recover it](/secret-manager/how-to/recover-version/) before the end of the retention period.
