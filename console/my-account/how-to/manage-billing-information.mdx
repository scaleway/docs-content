## How to add a payment method

Before you can order Scaleway resources, you must first add your billing information to your account.

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) 
  - You have an [Owner](/console/my-account/concepts#owner), [Administrator](/console/my-account/concepts#administrator) or [Billing Administrator](/console/my-account/concepts#billing-administrator) role.

</Message>

- Click **Billing** in the Organization drop-down menu of your Scaleway console.
- Scroll down to **Payment Methods**.

You can choose between two payment methods: credit card or SEPA mandate.

### How to add a Credit card

<Message type="note">

This method is available for the **Test** and **Build** [Account Levels](/console/my-account/how-to/upgrade-an-account/).

</Message>

1. Enter the details of your credit or debit card and your billing address.
2. Click **Add Billing Information** to confirm. A [3D Secure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-D_Secure) validation is initiated. Depending on your bank you may be asked to enter a code received by SMS or via an application on your smartphone.
3. Enter the code and validate the form.

  <Message type="note">

    - When you register a new credit card, an authorization charge is debited from your account. An **Authorization Charge** is a dummy transaction made to check the validity of the card.
    - The authorization charge is of **1â‚¬** and will carry a 4-digit Magic Code, displayed on your bank account statement. This Magic Code will be used to verify your credit card for your Scaleway account.

  </Message> 

4. Click **Verify**. A pop-up appears.

5. Enter the 4-digit Magic Code displayed on your bank account statement.

<Message type="important">

You have up to 10 days to enter your Magic Code in the console

</Message> 
If your card is successfully verified, you will see a confirmation message.


### How to add a SEPA mandate

<Message type="note">

This method is available for the **Build** account level (it requires a successful [KYC verification](/console/my-account/how-to/verify-identity).

</Message> 

1. Click **SEPA Direct Debit** under **Payment Methods**,.

2. Click **+Add a SEPA Mandate**. A pop-up appears.

3. Enter the required information.

4. Click **Add your payment method** to confirm.

## How to change your payment method

If you have registered both a **credit card** and a **SEPA mandate**, you can choose the default payment method you wish to use for your Scaleway account.

1. Click **Billing** in the Organization drop-down menu to go to the Billing Overview page.

2. Scroll down to find **Payment Methods**.

3. Select the payment method you wish to use as default.
