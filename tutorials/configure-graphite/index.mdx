Graphite is a popular tool for monitoring and visualizing time-series data. It performs two main functions:

1. **Efficient Time-Series Data Storage**: Graphite stores time-related data with minimal resource usage and ensures data integrity.
2. **Flexible Visualization and Data Manipulation**: It allows you to visualize the stored data and perform mathematical operations (like sum, scaling, or grouping) in real-time.

This tutorial provides the steps needed to install and configure Graphite on **Ubuntu 22.04** and get started with monitoring and visualizing your metrics.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A **Scaleway account** logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- **Owner** status or **IAM permissions** that allow performing actions in the intended Organization
- An **SSH key** for server access
- An **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** Instance up and running
- **API key** for interacting with Scaleway’s services
- **`sudo` privileges** or root user access to the system

## Installing Graphite

1. Update the system to make sure all packages are up to date:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```

2. Install the required packages for Graphite:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y graphite-web graphite-carbon
    ```

## Configuring the Graphite web application

1. **Edit the configuration file** for the web interface:
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/graphite/local_settings.py
    ```

2. Set a `SECRET_KEY` to secure Graphite (you can generate a secure key online or use `openssl`):
    ```python
    SECRET_KEY = 'your_generated_secure_key'
    ```

3. Set the correct `TIME_ZONE` (adjust to your local timezone, e.g. `Europe/Paris`):
    ```python
    TIME_ZONE = 'Europe/Paris'
    ```

4. Save the file and quit the editor.

5. Migrate the database to set up the initial database schema:
    ```bash
    sudo graphite-manage migrate
    ```

## Configuring Carbon (storage backend)

1. Edit the Carbon configuration to ensure it starts on boot:
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/default/graphite-carbon
    ```

2. Change the `CARBON_CACHE_ENABLED` option to `true`:
    ```bash
    CARBON_CACHE_ENABLED=true
    ```

3. Save and quit the editor.

4. Configure Carbon settings for data retention:
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/carbon/carbon.conf
    ```

5. Set **log rotation** to `True` for better system management:
    ```bash
    ENABLE_LOGROTATION = True
    ```

6. Save and quit.

## Configuring storage schemas

1. Open the storage schemas file to adjust retention policies:
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/carbon/storage-schemas.conf
    ```

2. Update the file to include your custom retention settings. Here’s an example:
    ```bash
    [test]
    pattern = ^test\.
    retentions = 10s:10m,1m:1h,10m:1d
    ```

    This configuration stores the data with varying levels of detail, from 10-second intervals to 10-minute intervals, depending on the data's age.

3. Save and close the file.

## Defining storage aggregation methods

To accurately aggregate your data, you can modify how Graphite aggregates metrics:

1. Copy the example configuration to the correct directory:
    ```bash
    sudo cp /usr/share/doc/graphite-carbon/examples/storage-aggregation.conf.example /etc/carbon/storage-aggregation.conf
    ```

2. Edit the aggregation file:
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/carbon/storage-aggregation.conf
    ```

3. Adjust the `aggregationMethod` to suit your data collection needs (e.g., `sum` for event counts, `average` for metrics like temperature):
    ```bash
    [min]
    pattern = \.min$
    xFilesFactor = 0.1
    aggregationMethod = min
    ```

4. Save and close the file.

5. Start the Carbon service to begin storing and aggregating data:
    ```bash
    sudo service carbon-cache start
    ```

## Installing and configuring Apache

To access the Graphite web interface, you need a web server. Here, we'll use **Apache**.

1. Install Apache and the required modules for Python 3:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3
    ```

2. Disable the default site to prevent conflicts:
    ```bash
    sudo a2dissite 000-default
    ```

3. Copy the Graphite Apache configuration:
    ```bash
    sudo cp /usr/share/graphite-web/apache2-graphite.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/
    ```

4. Enable the Graphite site:
    ```bash
    sudo a2ensite apache2-graphite
    ```

5. Reload Apache to apply changes:
    ```bash
    sudo service apache2 reload
    ```

6. Verify the web interface by opening your browser and navigating to `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP`.

## Discovering the web interface

1. Log into Graphite using the credentials you set during migration, or create a new superuser if needed:
    ```bash
    sudo graphite-manage createsuperuser
    ```

2. Access your **carbon metrics** from the menu on the left to view data collected by Graphite.

3. Create **dashboards** to monitor various metrics and visualize your data.

## Feeding data to Graphite

Now that Graphite is set up, you can send data to it. For simplicity, use the **Plaintext protocol** to send data directly from the terminal:

1. Send test data using the following command:
    ```bash
    echo "test.count 42 $(date +%s)" | nc -q0 localhost 2003
    ```

    This sends a metric named `test.count` with the value `42`.

2. Refresh the Graphite interface and see your new data displayed under the `test` schema.

3. Adjust the time range in Graphite to see how the data appears over different periods.

## Conclusion

You have now successfully installed and configured Graphite on **Ubuntu 22.04**. You've learned how to:

- Set up the Graphite web application and configure the backend with Carbon.
- Set data retention policies and aggregation methods.
- Feed test data into Graphite and visualize it through the web interface.

For production environments, consider using tools to automate data collection, as sending metrics via the terminal is not recommended for long-term use.
