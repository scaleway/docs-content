[Kubernetes (K8s)](https://kubernetes.io) is an open source project that is constantly evolving, integrating and deprecating features and applying bug fixes. The project is supported by the community, which releases between four and six new minor versions every year.

With Scaleway Kubernetes you can use the latest version of Kubernetes as soon as it is officially released and certified by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/). The versions are usually available in Kubernetes Kapsule and Kubernetes Kosmos within a few days after the release.

<Message type="important">

Each minor Kubernetes version is supported by Scaleway Kubernetes for at least twelve months before being deprecated.

## Version management recommandation
We recommended you keep your Kubernetes clusters up-to-date with the latest available minor version of Kubernetes and the latest patches.

### Cluster auto-upgrade
The auto-upgrade functionality provided by [Kubernetes Kapsule](https://www.scaleway.com/en/kubernetes-kapsule/) & [Kubernetes Kosmos](https://www.scaleway.com/en/kubernetes-kosmos/) on the control plane and the managed node versions of Kubernetes can be activated using the API, CLI, or the Scaleway console. For this functionality to operate correctly, the `kube-system` namespace of a cluster must not be altered or have any user-induced behaviors that could interfere with the auto-upgrade functionality.

## Support
Before opening a support ticket related to cluster behavior or a Kubernetes component, we highly recommend that you upgrade the cluster to the latest version of Kubernetes. If the upgrade to a new minor version is not possible, the latest patch of the version running on the cluster must be applied.
80% of Kubernetes issues are usually fixed when applying the latest patch version available.

## Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule & Kosmos release calendar

* **Release:** Version is available for cluster creation and cluster upgrade.
* **Deprecation:** Version is removed from cluster creation option. Customers are informed via a support ticket that they are using a deprecated version of Kubernetes and are asked to update their clusters.
* **End of support:** Version is not supported anymore, clusters will be automatically upgraded to the next supported minor version.
