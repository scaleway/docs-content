You can now add a public IPv6 address to both new and existing Load Balancers. This feature is available for all regions, and IPv6 addresses can be attached in addition to existing IPv4 addresses. Find out more in our [documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/network/load-balancer/how-to/create-manage-flex-ips/).
