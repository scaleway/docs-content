## Abuse

[Abuse](https://www.scaleway.com/en/abuse-notice/) of Scaleway services includes cyber-crime, copyright violation, illegal or offensive content, spamming and malware distribution. Abuse should be [reported in the console](https://console.scaleway.com/support/abuses/create).

Abuse reports on the same offending resource for the same reason within a given timeframe are grouped by case. An abuse report either creates a case if no case is currently open or joins an existing case. Scaleway clients are responsible for taking the appropriate security measures to solve the case and related abuses.

## Account unification

Account unification refers to the process of having a single user experience for both Dedibox and Scaleway users for authentication, account creation, and account settings management. Starting November 2025, Dedibox clients will progressively be integrated in the account unification process and be able to login and manage their information in the Scaleway console.

## Authorized SSH key

An SSH key (**S**ecure **Sh**ell key) allows passwordless authentication on SSH sessions. An SSH key is generated by creating an RSA key pair consisting of two elements:

- a sensitive **identification key**, (i.e. private key) which must be stored securely,
- a **public key** which is uploaded to the Scaleway Dedibox interface.

The public key is kept in your Scaleway account and transferred to the Dedibox server during the installation, while the identification key is kept securely on your local computer. When connecting to the Instance via SSH, a trusted connection to the machine is established using the key pair.

## Billing

The billing section contains all information related to the payment of your invoices. You can update your billing method from this page and download your invoices. It also allows you to define an additional billing contact, who receives a copy of your monthly invoice by email.

## Dedibox console

The Dedibox console allows you to view and manage your Scaleway Dedibox products, billing information, support tickets and more. You can access the console at the address [console.online.net](https://console.online.net).

## Logs

On this page you can see a list of connections made to your account. Each connection attempt is tracked with its associated status. It can either be **Login** for successful connections or **Connection refused** for failed logins.

## Messages

The messages section of the Scaleway Dedibox console contains important messages regarding your account or your services. You will find information regarding planned maintenance or other important information in this section of the console.

## Notifications

The notification section lets you define for which services you want to receive notifications by email. By default, you receive notifications for all your services requiring renewal (domain names and Webhosting services). You can opt out if you do not want to receive renewal notifications for certain services.

## Outsourcing

Outsourcing allows you to provide access to your services to third parties. You can define another Scaleway Dedibox user who will have access to specific resources of your account, without needing to provide access to your full account. Scaleway Dedibox maintains a portfolio of [certified outsourcing partners](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/outsourcing/) for webmastering and administration of your dedicated servers.

## Personal information

The interface to manage personal information related to your account depends if your account has been through the account unification process.
**If your Scaleway and Dedibox accounts are unified**: Your personal information can be managed in [account.scaleway.com](https://account.scaleway.com). Any update in your personal information will apply to both Scaleway and Dedibox console, as a single account is used for both consoles in your case.
**If your Scaleway and Dedibox accounts are not unified yet**: Your personal information can be managed in the section of the Scaleway Dedibox console. You can also update your password or email address from this section.

## Scaleway console

The Scaleway console allows you to order and consume public cloud products with the same identity used to connect to Dedibox console, once your account has been through the account unification process. When accounts are unified, you can login through [account.scaleway.com](https://account.scaleway.com) and manage your settings [in the same portal](https://account.scaleway.com/settings)

## Security

The interface to manage account security depends if your account has been through the Account unification process.
**If your Scaleway and Dedibox accounts are unified**: Your security settings can be managed in [account.scaleway.com](https://account.scaleway.com). You can change your password, get informed about other authentication methods, and define multifactor authentication through one-time password ("TOTP") or passkey.
**If your Scaleway and Dedibox accounts are not unified yet**: Your security settings can be managed in the related section of the Scaleway Dedibox console. You can configure optional multifactor authentication to increase the security of your account. You can configure MFA using authentications applications or password managers. French residents cans optionally also configure MFA by SMS.
