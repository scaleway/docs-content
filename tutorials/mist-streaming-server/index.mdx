Once everything is set, copy the code and paste it into your website. Alternatively, you can use the dedicated HTML page to link to the stream. It will be available at `http://<your_compute_instance_ip>:8080/<stream-name>.html`.

You can now start streaming your video content directly using your Instance. To learn more about MistServer, refer to the [official documentation](https://mistserver.org/guides/latest).
