To detach a block volume from a running Instance, relaunch the API call and omit the volume you want to hot unplug. Like so:

```
curl -q \
	-H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
	-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
	-X PATCH \
	-d '{
	       "volumes": {
	         "0": "7fe25caf-0a68-46a7-aeb9-63a278d33e2b",
	       }
	    }' \
	https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/{zone}/servers/{server_id}
```
