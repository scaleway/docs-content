The Private Network feature of the managed Load Balancers product lets you configure your Load Balancer with a Private Network. [Scaleway Private Networks](/network/vpc/concepts/#private-networks) allow your cloud resources to communicate in an isolated and secure network. Load Balancers using Private Networks can communicate with your backend servers without using the public Internet. You can add your Load Balancer to one or multiple existing Private Networks. The feature supports both static IP and DHCP configuration for the Load Balancer IP in the Private Network.
