Starting November 13, 2024, Edge Services cache servers will change how they handle HTTP (`port 80`) requests. Instead of serving content over HTTP, they will issue an `HTTP 302` redirect to HTTPS (`port 443`), keeping the rest of the URL unchanged. This update applies only to Edge Services integrations with Object Storage.
