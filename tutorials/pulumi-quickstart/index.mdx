Pulumi is an open-source infrastructure-as-code tool for creating, deploying and managing cloud infrastructure. Pulumi works with traditional infrastructures like VMs, networks, and databases and modern architectures, including containers, Kubernetes clusters, and serverless functions. Pulumi supports dozens of public, private, and hybrid cloud service providers.

</Message>

## Installing Pulumi

Before you can deploy a Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule, you need to install the [Pulumi CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/reference/cli/). This can be done either on your local development machine or on your build agent. We cover the installation of the cli for some scenarios in the next section.

Pulumi stores metadata about your infrastructure so that it can manage your cloud resources. This metadata is called state.

Pulumi stores state in a backend of your choosing and there are two classes of backends:

- Service: a managed cloud experience using the online or self-hosted Pulumi Service application
- Self-Managed: a manually managed object store, including [Scaleway Object Storage](https://www.scaleway.com/en/object-storage/), AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, any AWS S3 compatible server such as Minio or Ceph, or your local filesystem


### Installation on MacOS

You can install Pulumi through the Homebrew package manager and using the official Pulumi Homebrew Tap.
Open a terminal and type the following command:

  ```
  $ brew install pulumi/tap/pulumi
  ```

### Installation on Windows

You can install Pulumi using elevated permissions through the Chocolatey package manager:

  ```
  $ choco install pulumi
  ```

### Installation on Linux

To install, run the installation script via the following command:

  ```
  $curl -fsSL https://get.pulumi.com | sh
  ```

This will install the pulumi CLI to `~/.pulumi/bin` and add it to your path. If this command fails at automatically adding pulumi to your path, you will be prompted to add it manually.

Alternatively, you can install Pulumi manually. Pulumi provided a prebuilt binary for Linux.

Head over to the [available versions](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/versions/) page to choose the version of Pulumi you want to install.

Extract the tarball and move the binaries in the pulumi directory to a directory included in your system's `$PATH`.

### Verifying your Installation

To verify that you have successfully installed Pulumi, run the following command:

  ```
  $ pulumi version
  v3.38.0
  ```

## Deploying your first Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule using Pulumi

Now that you have installed Pulumi, you can start deploying your Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule. Before you can create your first Pulumi program, you need to know what language you are going to use.

Pulumi is a multi-language infrastructure as code tool. You have a wide range of programming languages available and you can use the one you are the most comfortable with. Currently, (6/2022) Pulumi supports the following languages:

- Node.js (JavaScript / TypeScript)
- Python
- Go
- Java
- .NET (C#, VB, F#)
- YAML

In this tutorial, we will use Typescript.

1. Create a project folder (for example `scaleway-pulumi`) and navigate into the newly created directory:
    ```
    $ mkdir scaleway-pulumi && cd scaleway-pulumi
    ```
2. Create a new Pulumi program with the following command:
    ```bash
    pulumi new typescript
    This command will walk you through creating a new Pulumi project.

    Enter a value or leave blank to accept the (default), and press <ENTER>.
    Press ^C at any time to quit.

    project name: pulumi-scaleway-quickstart
    project description: (A minimal TypeScript Pulumi program)
    Created project 'pulumi-scaleway-quickstart'

    Please enter your desired stack name.
    To create a stack in an organization, use the format <org-name>/<stack-name> (e.g. `acmecorp/dev`).
    stack name: (dev)
    Created stack 'dev'

    The argument `typescript` will tell Pulumi to create a new program in the using the `typescript` template.

    Pulumi offers plenty of templates, if you are unsure of what to use, just use type following command and choose from the huge collection of templates:

    ```
    $ pulumi new
    Please choose a template:  [Use arrows to move, enter to select, type to filter]

    azure-python                   A minimal Azure Native Python Pulumi program
    ....
    ```
3. Add the Scaleway provider
4. Add the Scaleway provider to your project via the `npm` command:
    ```
    $ npm install @lbrlabs/pulumi-scaleway --save --save-exact
    ```
5. Set the Scaleway credentials
6. Add the Scaleway Credentials with the following commands to the Pulumi config:
    ```
    $ pulumi config set scaleway:access_key YYYY --secret
    $ pulumi config set scaleway:secret_key ZZZZ --secret
    $ pulumi config set scaleway:project_id ZZZZ
    ```

    Alternatively, you can set the API credentials via the environment variables:

    ```
    $ export SCW_ACCESS_KEY=YYYY
    $ export SCW_SECRET_KEY=ZZZZ
    $ export SCW_PROJECT_ID=ZZZZ
    ```
7. Add this code to your `index.ts` file:
    ```typescript
    import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
    import * as scaleway from "@lbrlabs/pulumi-scaleway";

    const kapsule = new scaleway.KubernetesCluster("pulumi-kapsule", {
          name: "pulumi-kapsule",
          version: "1.23",
          region: "fr-par",
          cni: "cilium",
          tags: [
            "pulumi",
            "scaleway",
          ],
          autoUpgrade: {
            enable: true,
            maintenanceWindowStartHour: 3,
            maintenanceWindowDay: "monday"
          },
          admissionPlugins: [
            "AlwaysPullImages",
          ],
        }
    )

    new scaleway.KubernetesNodePool("pulumi-kapsule-pool", {
      zone: "fr-par-1",
      name: "pulumi-kapsule-pool",
      nodeType: "DEV1-L",
      size: 1,
      autoscaling: true,
      minSize: 1,
      maxSize: 3,
      autohealing: true,
      clusterId: kapsule.id,
    })

    export const kapsuleId = kapsule.id;
    export const kubeconfig = pulumi.secret(kapsule.kubeconfigs[0].configFile);
    ```
8. Run the following command to deploy your program:
    ```
    $ pulumi up
    ```

    The output of the preview command displays. The preview shows you the changes that will be made to your cloud infrastructure. You can then decide to deploy the changes or to cancel the deployment.

    With the command `pulumi preview`, you explicitly ask Pulumi to preview the changes.

    ```
    $ pulumi up
    Previewing update (dev)

10. Retrieve the kubeconfig file

    In our `typescript` code, we exported the kubeconfig file as an output and marked it as a secret.

    ```
    $ export const kubeconfig = pulumi.secret(kapsule.kubeconfigs[0].configFile);
    ```

    To retrieve the kubeconfig file for manual use, you can use the following command:

    ```
    $ pulumi stack output kubeconfig --show-secrets > kubeconfig.yaml
    ```

    Run the following command to verify that the kubeconfig file is valid.

    ```
    $ export KUBECONFIG=kubeconfig.yaml && kubectl get nodes
    NAME                                             STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
    scw-pulumi-kapsule-pulumi-kapsule-pool-6d0c822   Ready    <none>   25m   v1.23.6
    ```

## Add new resources to your Pulumi program

This section shows you how to modify your existing Pulumi program to add a new worker pool to your cluster.

Add this line to your existing `index.ts` file:

```typescript
new scaleway.KubernetesNodePool("pulumi-kapsule-pool-small", {
  zone: "fr-par-1",
  name: "pulumi-kapsule-pool-small",
  nodeType: "DEV1-M",
  size: 2,
  autoscaling: false,
  autohealing: true,
  clusterId: kapsule.id,
})
```

Run the `pulumi preview` command to see the potential changes in your cloud infrastructure.

```
$ pulumi preview
Previewing update (dev)
