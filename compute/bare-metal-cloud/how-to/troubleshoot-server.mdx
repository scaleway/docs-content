If your Bare Metal Cloud Server does not work as expected, you can use KVM-over-IP to connect to your server even if it is no longer reachable over the Internet.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)  
- You have [configured your SSH Key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key)
- You have [created](/compute/bare-metal-cloud/how-to/create-server) and [installed](/compute/bare-metal-cloud/how-to/install-server) a Bare Metal server

</Message>


1. Click **Bare Metal** in the **Compute** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Bare Metal dashboard displays.

2. Click the name of the server you want to troubleshoot.

3. Click the **Remote Access** tab.

4. Agree to the terms related to this service and click **Manage connection**.

5. Enter the IP address of your local computer and click **Create remote access**.

  Your credentials are created and you are redirected to the **Remote Access** tab. The KVM is reachable from the address shown at **Connection IP**. 
  
6. Click **Connection IP** to access the KVM device.

7. Log into the KVM device with the credentials shown in the management console.

8. Once you have finished your intervention, disable remote access from your management console for security reasons. Click **Delete** to flush the credentials.
