Data federation allows you to query and combine data from multiple sources, enabling seamless analytics across different databases or storage systems without the need to move or duplicate data. 

Scaleway Data Warehouse for ClickHouse® allows you to quickly import any type of compatible data into a [bottomless storage](/data-warehouse/concepts/#bottomless-storage) with minimal configuration.

## How to import data using the CLickHouse® CLI

### Connecting to the CLickHouse® CLI

1. Click **Data Warehouse** under **Managed Services** on the side menu. The Data Warehouse deployment page displays.

2. Click the name of the Data Warehouse deployment you want to connect to. The overview tab of the deployment displays.

3. Click **Connect** next to **Frameworks** in the **Connect to your deployment** section. The connection wizard displays. 

4. Select **Protocols**, then copy the command in the **ClickHouse® CLI** tab.

5. In a terminal, paste and execute the copied command to connect to your deployment. Make sure to replace the placeholders by the corresponding values.

    ```sh
    clickhouse client \
    --host <YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_URL> \
    --port 9440 \
    --secure \
    --user scwadmin \
    --password '<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_PASSWORD>'
    ```

7. You are now connected to your deployments using the ClickHouse® CLI, you can now import data.

### Importing data into your deployment

There are several ways to import data into your Data Warehouse for ClickHouse® deployment, depending on how your data is stored:

- Using the `s3` table function: directly read data from an Amazon S3 bucket by specifying the bucket URL, the file format, and data structure.

- Using the `s3` Storage Engine: create a table that points to your S3 data, then insert data from the S3 table into your target table.

- Using `clickhouse-client`: execute an INSERT query to populate a table by specifying the bucket URL and the file format.
