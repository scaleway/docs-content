## Overview

### What is Scaleway Queues?

Scaleway Queues is a product for creating managed message queues, using an in-house implementation of AWS SQS protocol. Queues allows you to implement your message queues without the hassle of managing the infrastructure, scaling, or updates. Message queues are ideal for facilitating asynchronous job processing and communication between microservices.

### What is the relationship between Scaleway Queues and AWS SQS?

**S**imple **Q**ueue **S**ervice, or SQS, is AWS's distributed message [queuing](#queuing) service, that supports programmatic sending of messages via web service applications. Scaleway has developed its own service based on AWS SQS protocol. Scaleway Queues does not have any dependencies on the AWS SQS infrastructure or offering, we use our own stack which is fully self-hosted and developed in-house.

## Pricing and billing

### How is Scaleway Queues billed?

Billing is based on [queue volume](/queues/concepts/#queue-volume) - the combined size of the messages travelling through queues. For full pricing details, see our [dedicated pricing page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/).

## Compatibility and integration

### Is the Scaleway Queues gateway compatible with my application, framework, or tool?

We currently implement the API endpoints listed [here](/queues/reference-content/queues-support/), which makes Scaleway Queues compatible with the AWS SDK as well as many other tools and frameworks including [KEDA](https://keda.sh/) and [Symfony](https://symfony.com/). Note that you need to specify both Regions and URL to ensure compatibility.

### Do Scaleway FIFO queues support the `MessageGroupId` identifier?

No, as stated on our [Supported Actions](/queues/reference-content/queues-support/) page, Scaleway Queues do not currently support `MessageGroupid`.

To ensure strict message ordering, FIFO queues on Scaleway are designed to allow only one message to be in flight at a time per queue. Because of this, there is no concept of message grouping. If you are using a Serverless Function triggered by the queue, the system will only deliver one message at a time, limiting horizontal scaling, as concurrent processing of independent message batches is not possible.
