You can now manage your SNS subscriptions [directly in the console](https://console.scaleway.com/messaging/protocols/). You can subscribe to HTTP/S endpoints and Serverless Compute resources (Functions & Containers). 
For more information, you can refer to our documentation [How to create and manage SNS subscriptions](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-subscriptions/).
