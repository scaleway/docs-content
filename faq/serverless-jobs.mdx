## What are Serverless Jobs?

Scaleway Serverless Jobs is a fully managed service that enables efficient execution of batch computing workloads. It automates management tasks, allowing users to run large-scale batch jobs with ease.

## How am I billed for Serverless Jobs?

### Principles

Serverless Jobs are billed on a pay-as-you-go basis, strictly on resource consumption (Memory and CPU). 

* **Memory consumption:** The memory consumption is obtained by multiplying the memory tier chosen by the job run duration.
* **vCPU consumption:** The vCPU consumption is obtained by multiplying the vCPU tier chosen by the job run duration.

### Prices 

* **Memory consumption:** €0.10 per 100 000 GB/s, and we provide a **400 000 GB/s free tier** per account and per month.

    | Memory   | Price per second  |
    |--------- |------------------ |
    | 128 MB   | €0.000000125      |
    | 256 MB   | €0.00000025       |
    | 512 MB   | €0.0000005        |
    | 1024 MB  | €0.000001         |
    | 2048 MB  | €0.000002         |
    | 3072 MB  | €0.000003         |
    | 4096 MB  | €0.000004         |

* **vCPU consumption:** €1.00 per 100 000 vCPU/s, and we provide a **200 000 vCPU/s free tier** per account per month.

    | CPU         | Price per second  |
    |------------ |------------------ |
    | 0.07 vCPU   | €0.0000007        |
    | 0.14 vCPU   | €0.0000014        |
    | 0.28 vCPU   | €0.0000028        |
    | 0.56 vCPU   | €0.0000056        |
    | 1.12 vCPU   | €0.0000112        |

### Example

| Criteria                   | Value            |
|--------------------------- |------------------|
| Monthly duration           | 432 000 s (120h) |
| Amount of memory allocated | 2048 MB          |
| Amount of vCPU allocated   | 1120 mVCPU       |
| Free tier                  | Yes              |

#### Price calculation

* **Memory consumption**
    * *Allocated Memory conversion:* 2048 MB = 2 GB
    * *Resource consumption:* 432 000 s * 2 GB = 864 000 GB/s
    * *Free tier:* 400 000 GB/s
    * *Billed resources:* 864 000 - 400 000 = 464 000 GB/s
    * *Cost:* 464 000 * €0.0000010 = **€0.47**
* **vCPU consumption**
    * *Allocated vCPU conversion:* 1120mVCPU = 1.12 vCPU
    * *Resource consumption:* 432 000 s * 1.12 vCPU =  483 840 vCPU/s
    * *Free tier:* 200 000 vCPU/s
    * *Billed resources:* 483 840 - 200 000 = 283 840 vCPU/s
    * *Cost:* 283 840 * €0.0000100 = **€2.84**

**Monthly Cost: €3,31**

## What types of workloads are best suited for Serverless Jobs?

Serverless Jobs is ideal for tasks such as data processing, analysis and various computational operations that can be executed in a non-interactive batch mode. You can execute short and long-running jobs.

## How can I monitor the activity of my Serverless Jobs?

Serverless Jobs are integrated with [Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/quickstart/), Scaleway's Observability service. Cockpit allows you to see all the logs and metrics associated with your job runs](/serverless/jobs/concepts/#job-run). Additionally, each job run has a status that provides you with real-time information on your job's execution.

## Can I cancel or modify a Serverless Job after it has started?

An ongoing Serverless Job can be interrupted during its execution from the **Job runs** section of a job's **Overview** tab.

## How can I automate the deployment and management of Scaleway Serverless Jobs?

Scaleway Serverless Jobs is part of the Scaleway ecosystem, it can therefore be driven using the [Scaleway CLI](/developer-tools/scaleway-cli/quickstart/), the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/), and other [developer tools](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/). Our serverless ecosystem offers a lot of possibilites with event-driven architectures, and integrations with more products of the Scaleway ecosystem are under active development.

## Do Serverless Jobs offer parallelization?

Not yet. Scaleway Serverless Jobs will soon offer parallelization via a `parallelism` parameter for each job. This will automatically launch a given number of replicas of the Job container in parallel.
