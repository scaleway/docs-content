Remote access is available on most Elastic Metal servers as an option. This option allows you to access the keyboard, video, and mouse of the machine remotely through a KVM-over-IP device. 
Using remote access you can access to the machine for debugging purposes, even if the installed OS is not working properly. It is also possible to install an [operating system](/compute/elastic-metal/how-to/install-server-from-kvm) on the machine using a remote ISO file.
