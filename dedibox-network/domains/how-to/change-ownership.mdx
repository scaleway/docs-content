You must always keep the contact details relating to the owner of your domain name accurate and up-to-date. This can be done by [following the instructions here](/dedibox-network/domains/how-to/file-contact-info). However, if you wish to change details pertaining to the identity of the owner (full name(s) of a natural person or corporate name for a legal entity) this must be done by the change of ownership process described below.

6. Create a handle for the new owner, containing all their contact details, and click **Confirm**.
7. Confirm the ownership trade and pay the administrative fee.
8. For the extensions `.fr`, `.eu` and `.be`, emails will be sent to both the old and new owners of the domain. Both parties are required to validate the trade by clicking the enclosed link. Without this action, the change of ownership will not be validated. 
    <Message type="important">
      The link in the email is valid for one month. After this it expires, and to get a new validation link you will need to restart the change of ownership process. A new administrative fee will be applied.
    </Message>

    For the extensions `.com`, `.net` and `.org`, the validation is done directly once your change of ownership request is confirmed.

To verify that the change of ownership has been successfully carried out, you can use [http://who.is/](http://who.is/).

## How to transfer web hosting

Once the ownership change is confirmed, you may wish to transfer your web hosting from the old owner's account to the new one.

1. From the old ownership account, back up your FTP and SQL data as well as the emails associated with the old account. 
2. Cancel the web hosting service using the following link in your management console: [https://console.online.net/en/account/services](https://console.online.net/en/account/services).
3. Wait for the cancellation request to go through. This may take a few minutes. You then see that the hosting service is no longer visible in the old account.
4. Log into the [management console](https://console.online.net) with the new ownership account.
5. Order the domain with web hosting.
6. Wait for the service to be delivered. This may take a few minutes.
7. Reconfigure the FTP access, any SQL databases and your email mailboxes and upload your backup to put the site back online.
