## How to create a seedbox with the torrents InstantApp

This page shows you how to use the torrents InstantApp to create a seedbox with a web interface to manage your torrents.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)

The torrents InstantApp provides:

- [Deluge](http://deluge-torrent.org/), a web interface to add, list, remove and download your torrents
- [h5ai](https://larsjung.de/h5ai/), a web file browser to browse and download your files
- [vsftp](https://security.appspot.com/vsftpd.html), a ftp server to manage and download your files
- an auto-installer, to configure your image after its creation

## Creating the instance

1. Click the "Create an instance" button in the **Instances** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers).

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-nc-new-server.png" alt="" />

2. On the server-creation page where you can choose the **Torrents** image in the **InstantApps** tab for your Cloud Instance:

3. Choose the server type and click the **Create a Server** button. This action starts your server.

## Run the auto installer

1. Go to the detail page of your server to get its public IP.

2. Open your browser, and go to `http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP` (for example: `http://212.47.0.0`) to run the auto installer.

3. Enter a username and a password, then submit the form to create your account. Choose your credentials carefully: that's not really easy to recover or change them later.

## Manage your torrents

1. To enter to the web application, enter the credentials your created just before.

2. You land on [Deluge](http://deluge-torrent.org/), which is empty for now.

3. Click the "add" button on the top of the page to add a torrent file.

  You can either upload a torrent file or give a magnet link to your torrent.

  Wait a few minutes (really, it's crazy fast!) until your torrent is downloaded. Then, to download it to your computer:
  
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-deluge_interface_download.png" alt="" />

    - Go to the file browser of your instance: http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP/downloads (for example: `http://212.47.0.0/downloads`)
    - Choose the file you want to download
    - Left-click the file to start the download automatically

  You can also download your files with a FTP client, for example [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) and the credentials used for your web authentication.
