## Transitioning from the Instance API to the Block Storage API for volume and snapshot management

Scaleway is transitioning the management of all Block Storage legacy volumes and snapshots from the [Instance API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/) to the [Block Storage API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/block/). All Block Storage volumes and snapshots created via the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) will no longer be available from the [Compute section](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/) but from the [Storage section](https://console.scaleway.com/block-storage).

This change streamlines how storage resources are managed by consolidating them under the Block Storage API, providing enhanced management features and clearer storage class distinctions. If you have created volumes and snapshots via the Instance API, we **strongly recommend transitioning to the Block Storage API** to align with the latest management practices.

Local volumes will remain exclusively supported by the Instance API.

## Differences between the Instance API and the Block Storage API

The key differences between the Instance API and the Block Storage API lie in the storage classes they manage, rather than just the APIs themselves. This distinction influences the underlying hardware and performance characteristics of the volumes.

### Storage classes

The Instance API handles only **BSSD (Basic SSD)** volumes.
The Block Storage API supports a broader range of storage classes, including:

  - **BSSD volumes**
  - **Scaleway Block Storage (SBS) 5K IOPS volumes**
  - **Scaleway Block Storage (SBS) 15K IOPS volumes**

### Underlying hardware

**BSSD volumes** (managed by both APIs) are built on **older-generation SSDs**, offering reliable performance but with limitations in speed and latency.

**Scaleway Block Storage 5K and 15K volumes** (managed only by the Block Storage API) are powered by **modern NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) disks**. They are optimized for **low-latency and high-speed operations**.

### Performance and latency

**BSSD volumes**:

  - **Performance**: Limited IOPS and slower data processing speed due to older SSD technology.
  - **Latency**: Higher latency, less suitable for applications requiring rapid data retrieval.

**Scaleway Block Storage 5K and 15K volumes**:

  - **Performance**: Enhanced performance with up to 5K IOPS (SBS 5K) and 15K IOPS (SBS 15K).
  - **Latency**: Lower latency, ideal for workloads demanding rapid and reliable data access.

## Why transition to the Block Storage API?

By transitioning to the Block Storage API, you align with Scaleway's consolidated storage management approach and gain access to advanced storage features and flexibility. While migrating to the Block Storage API does not inherently change the performance of BSSD volumes, you benefit from:

- **Unified management**: Simplified volume and snapshot management through a dedicated API.
- **Access to advanced storage classes**: You can create new Scaleway Block Storage 5K or 15K volumes for workloads needing higher performance and lower latency.
- **Ongoing support**: Enhanced support and updates tailored for Block Storage API-managed resources.

## Impact on volume names in virtual machines

When transitioning to the Block Storage API, you may notice changes in how volumes are identified in your virtual machines (VMs). For more details on how devices are named and identified, please refer to [this documentation](/compute/instances/reference-content/identify-devices/).

## How to transition

For a step-by-step guide to transitioning your Block Storage legacy volumes to the Block Storage API, refer to [our migration documentation](/compute/instances/how-to/migrate-volumes-snapshots-to-sbs/).
