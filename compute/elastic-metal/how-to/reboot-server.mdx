If your [Elastic Metal server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/elastic-metal/) is no longer reachable from the Internet or does not work as expected, you can reboot it from the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com). The reboot feature forces a reset of the physical hardware and restarts the machine.

      Rebooting your server may corrupt your data if there are unwritten files. Your software will not be stopped before the server is being rebooted and you should use this feature only when your server is not reachable over the Internet.
