Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule provides a managed environment for creating, configuring, and operating a cluster of preconfigured nodes for containerized applications. This service allows you to deploy [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) clusters without the complexity of managing the underlying infrastructure.

Key benefits include:
  * Dynamic scaling of pods based on workload demands.
  * Simplified cluster management via [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/), the Kubernetes command-line tool.

To facilitate cluster administration, Scaleway provides a `.kubeconfig` file, enabling you to manage your cluster locally using `kubectl`. [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) is essential for executing commands against Kubernetes clusters.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account with access to the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## Cluster configuration

<Message type="note">
  This guide covers the creation of a **Kubernetes Kapsule** cluster. For Kubernetes Kosmos clusters, refer to the [Kubernetes Kosmos documentation](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-kosmos-cluster/).
</Message>

1. Navigate to **Kubernetes** under the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The Kubernetes dashboard displays.
2. Click **Create cluster** to launch the cluster creation wizard.
3. On the cluster configuration page, provide the following details:
    * Check the Organization and Project for the new cluster.
        <Message type="important">
          You cannot move a cluster from one Organization or Project to another once created.
        </Message>
    * Select **Kubernetes Kapsule** as the cluster type, which uses exclusively Scaleway Instances.
    * Choose the geographical **region** for the cluster.
    * Select the control plane offer for your cluster. Options include shared or dedicated control planes.
        <Message type="tip">
          Need help deciding on a control plane offer? Learn more about our [Kubernetes control plane offers](/containers/kubernetes/reference-content/kubernetes-control-plane-offers/).
        </Message>
    * Specify the **Kubernetes version** for your cluster.
4. Enter the **cluster's details**. Provide a name for the cluster. Optionally, you can add a description and tags for better organization.
5. Configure the **Private Network** for the cluster to ensure secure and isolated network communication. Each cluster is auto-configured with a /22 IP subnet. Click **Select Private Network** to:
    * Attach an existing Private Network (VPC) within the same Availability Zone from the drop-down menu.
    * Attach a new Private Network to the cluster.
    <Message type="important">
      The Private Network cannot be detached, and the cluster cannot be moved to another Private Network post-creation.

6. Click **Configure pools** to proceed.

## Pool configuration

This section outlines the settings for your cluster pools. You can configure as many pools for your cluster as you require.

1. Configure the following for each pool:
    * Choose an **Availability Zone** for the pool's nodes.
    * Select the **node type** for the pool.
        <Message type="tip">

        </Message>
    * Configure the **system volume**. This volume contains the operating system of the nodes in your pool.
    * Configure **pool options**, including node count and whether to enable autoscaling. Options also include enabling autoheal and linking to a placement group, or you can retain default settings.

        </Message>
    * Enable full isolation, if required.

        </Message>
2. Click **Add pool** to integrate the pool into the cluster.
3. To add more pools, click **Expand** and repeat the steps above.
    <Message type="tip">
      You can add or remove pools as needed before finalizing your cluster configuration. To remove a pool, click **Remove** within the respective pool.
    </Message>
4. Once all pools are configured, click **Review** to finalize your cluster setup.

## Review configuration

1. Review the configuration details of your Kubernetes cluster and its pools.
    <Message type="tip">
      To modify any element, click the <Icon name="edit" /> **Edit** icon next to the respective configuration component.
    </Message>
2. Click **Create cluster** to deploy your cluster. Once deployment is complete, the cluster appears in the clusters list.
