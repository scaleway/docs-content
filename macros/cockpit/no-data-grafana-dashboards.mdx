## Problem

I am experiencing one of the following issues:

- I am missing data on my Grafana dashboards
- A `No data` message displays
- An error banner stating `Failed to upgrade legacy queries datasource was not found` displays
- My Cockpit is unavailable.
- I cannot view your logs and/or metrics in Grafana.
- I cannot view your dashboards in Grafana.

## Cause

These issues often occur due to synchronization failures between Cockpit and Grafana, preventing dashboards from displaying the latest logs and metrics as expected.

## Solution

Refer to the [dedicated troubleshooting documentation](/cockpit/troubleshooting/synchronize-grafana-data-sources/) on how to synchronize Grafana sources.
