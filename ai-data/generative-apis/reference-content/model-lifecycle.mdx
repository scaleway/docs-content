Scaleway is dedicated to updating and offering the latest versions of generative AI models, ensuring improvements in capabilities, accuracy, and safety.

As new versions of models are introduced, you have the opportunity to explore them through the Scaleway console.

A model provided through Scaleway Generative APIs may be classified into one of these statuses: `Active`, `Deprecated`, or `End-of-Life` (EOL).

- **Active**: This status indicates that the model version is under continuous development by the provider, with ongoing updates that may include bug fixes and enhancements.
- **Deprecated**: A model version is designated deprecated when a newer, more efficient version is available. Scaleway assigns an EOL date to these deprecated versions. Although deprecated versions remain usable, it's recommended to transition to an active version by the EOL date.
- **EOL**: At this stage, the model version is retired and no longer accessible for use. Any attempts to utilize an End-of-Life version will not be successful.

<Message type="note">
  In the Scaleway console, a model versionâ€™s status is marked as either **Active** or **Deprecated**. 
</Message>

We guarantee support for new models for at least 8 months starting from their regional launch. Customers will receive a 3-month notice before any model is marked as End-of-Life (EOL).

<Message type="important">
  Following the EOL date, information regarding the model version remains exclusively available on our [dedicated documentation page](/ai-data/generative-apis/reference-content/supported-models/#deprecated-models).
