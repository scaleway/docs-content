Scaleway Load Balancers are built on top of the Instances infrastructure, meaning their environmental footprint is derived from the underlying virtual instances that power the service. The footprint calculation also accounts for additional control plane components specific to the Load Balancer service.

This page details how the environmental impact of Load Balancers is calculated.

<Message type="important">
The calculations described on this page take into consideration all the elements described in the [Environmental Footprint calculation breakdown](/environmental-footprint/additional-content/environmental-footprint-calculator/) documentation page.

## Calculation Aspects

The total estimated environmental impact of the Load Balancer product integrates the following components:

- **Dedicated manufacturing impact** – Related to the physical servers hosting the virtual instances that run the Load Balancer service.
- **Related manufacturing impact** – Includes the impact of tools used to manage the service: control plane, monitoring systems, and internal networking infrastructure.
- **Energy usage impact** – The average electricity consumption during operation, including associated data center infrastructure (PUE), network, and cross-IT equipment.

### Allocation Methodology

The Load Balancer product reuses the same environmental footprint model as [Instances](/environmental-footprint/additional-content/instances-env-footprint/), with impact allocated based on the underlying instance usage. All variables (e.g., server lifespan, energy mix, PUE) follow the definitions established in the [Environmental Footprint calculation breakdown](/environmental-footprint/additional-content/environmental-footprint-calculator/#definition-of-the-variables).

Specifically:
- **Datacenter and technical environment**: Calculated as defined in the mother page, allocated according to the underlying instances [environmental-footprint-calculator.mdx].
- **Network impact**: Allocated proportionally based on the underlying instances’ network usage [environmental-footprint-calculator.mdx].
- **Customer servers**: Impact is calculated using the same method as for Bare Metal servers, but allocated according to instance usage [environmental-footprint-calculator.mdx].
- **Cross-IT equipment & stock**: The base calculation follows the general methodology, with an **additional allocation** for equipment dedicated to the Load Balancer control plane.

> The manufacturing and energy impacts are first computed at the instance level, then attributed to Load Balancer usage based on resource consumption share.

### Usage Impact

The energy consumption of Load Balancers is derived from the underlying instances. We use CPU usage as a proxy, applying [Boavizta’s non-linear consumption profiles](https://doc.api.boavizta.org/Reference/routes/#consumption-profile-routes) to estimate power draw.

For operational impact:
- **Energy mix**: French grid emission factor: 0.065 kgCO2e/kWh
- **PUE**: 1.16 (average across Scaleway data centers)

#### Calculation Example

Assume a Load Balancer runs on an underlying instance with:
- Power consumption: 110 W (0.110 kW)
- Usage duration: 100 hours
- Allocation ratio (based on instance share): `lb_ratio = 0.5`

**Energy Usage Impact**:
```math
UsageFootprint = 0.110 \times 100 \times 0.065 \times 1.16 = 0.825\ kgCO2e
```

**Manufacturing Impact** (6-year lifespan = 52,560 hours, manufacturing impact = 850 kgCO2e):
```math
ManufacturingImpact = (100 / 52560) \times 850 \times 0.5 = 0.81\ kgCO2e
```

Total footprint: **1.635 kgCO2e** for 100 hours of usage.

Water consumption is derived from the same energy usage value, multiplied by the [Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE)](/environmental-footprint/concepts/#water-usage-effectiveness) of the data center. This applies to zones where WUE data is available (FR-PAR-1, FR-PAR-2, FR-PAR-3, NL-AMS-1) [environmental-footprint-calculator.mdx].
