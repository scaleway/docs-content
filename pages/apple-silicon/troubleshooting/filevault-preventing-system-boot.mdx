- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- A [Mac mini](/apple-silicon/how-to/create-mac-mini/)

## Problem
FileVault encryption is preventing your Mac mini from booting properly.

### Symptoms
- The Mac mini does not complete the boot process.
- A FileVault password prompt appears at startup.
- Remote access via SSH or VNC is unavailable after a reboot.

### Possible causes
- FileVault is enabled on the system disk.
- The Mac mini rebooted and requires a FileVault password to proceed.
- Remote access is blocked because the system is waiting for manual decryption.

### Solution

#### Verify if FileVault is enabled
To check FileVault status:
1. Open **System Preferences**.
2. Go to **Security & Privacy**.
3. Click the **FileVault** tab.
4. If FileVault is enabled, it will indicate that disk encryption is active.

#### Disable FileVault to ensure boot continuity
1. Open **System Preferences**.
2. Click **Security & Privacy** > **FileVault**.
3. Click **Turn Off FileVault**.
4. Enter the administrator password if prompted.
5. Allow the decryption process to complete.

#### Reboot and verify boot success
After turning off FileVault:
- Reboot your Mac mini and confirm that it starts up without requesting the FileVault password.
- Test remote access via SSH or VNC to ensure connectivity remains available.

<Message type="important">
If FileVault is enabled and your Mac mini reboots unexpectedly, you will be required to enter the FileVault password manually. Remote access will not be possible until the disk is unlocked, and you may risk data loss.
</Message>

## Preventing future issues
To prevent FileVault from causing boot issues in the future:
- **Avoid enabling FileVault** on Scaleway Mac minis.
- **Use alternative encryption methods** that do not require manual intervention on reboot.
- **Ensure proper backups** before making changes to encryption settings.
