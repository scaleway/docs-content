[Private Networks](/network/vpc/concepts/#private-networks) allows you to enhance the security of your system's architecture by isolating it from the Internet.

When using Private Networks, your application connects directly to your Database nodes without going through a Load Balancer.

This improves performance by reducing the latency between your application and your database nodes. It also increases the security of your databases, as Instances in your Private Network can directly communicate with your Database Instance, without passing through the public Internet.

You can create new Database Instances to attach to your Private Network, or attach existing ones.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have a [PostgreSQL or MySQL Database Instance](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/quickstart)
  - You have [generated an API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
</Message>

## How to attach a Database Instance to a Private Network

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Click the **Private Networks** tabs. The Private Network configuration displays.
4. Click **+ Attach Private Network**. The Private Network configuration wizard displays.
    - You can choose whether to:
        - Select and attach an existing Private Network and select the network from the drop-down list.
        - Create and attach a new Private Network and enter the name of the network in the form.

    <Message type="important">
      Your private IP addresses are automatically allocated. They are managed via an IP Address Manager (IPAM). You can retrieve them on the Private Network tab of your Database Instance. To allocate IPs manually, you can use the Scaleway API and CLI, or Terraform.

5. Click **Attach Private Network** to conclude.

<Message type="tip">
  If you are using Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule, you can use the [scaleway-k8s-vpc](https://github.com/Sh4d1/scaleway-k8s-vpc) GitHub project to connect a Database Instance to your pods using a Private Network.<br /><br />
  Once your Kapsule node is connected to the Private Network you can directly reach the database by using the assigned service IP. There is no need to expose it through a Kubernetes resource like a service. The database is ready to use out of the box. <br /><br />
  **The `scaleway-k8s-vpc` is not an officially supported by Scaleway.**

2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Click the **Private Networks** tabs. The Private Network configuration displays.
4. Click <Icon name="unlink" /> next to the static IP that you want to unlink from your Database Instance.
5. Click **Detach resource** to remove the Instance from your Private Network.
