**Aer** is the high-performance emulator framework for the Qiskit software stack. It provides powerful backends to emulate quantum circuits with realistic noise models, using advanced optimization techniques.

While Aer can run on a local laptop, simulating complex circuits with many qubits requires significant computational power. **Scaleway QaaS** allows you to offload these heavy simulations to dedicated **GPU and CPU clusters** directly from your Python code.

## Why use Aer on Scaleway?

Scaleway provides a seamless bridge between your local Qiskit environment and cloud-based High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources:

* **Multi purpose emulation:** Aer is a robust emulator that supported many simulation methods: `statevector`, `density_matrix`, `matrix_product_state`, `unitary` and `tensor_network`. All this methods are supported by our Platforms.
* **Billed at time:** The billing starting time begins only when the Platform is fully operational and the first Job can be executed.
* **GPU acceleration:** Instantly allocate powerful Nvidia GPUs (like H100 or L40S cluster ) to accelerate tensor-network or statevector emulator.
* **Optimized stack:** We provide pre-configured environments (Platforms) tuned for high performance, ensuring Aer utilizes the underlying hardware to its full potential.
* **Noise model support:** Our Aer-based Platforms support custom noise model with you are willing to mimic a real QPU behaviour. See [further doc](https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-aer/apidocs/aer_noise.html).
* **Data compression:** To minimize latency and bandwidth usage, quantum circuits (upload) and emulator results (download) are automatically compressed during transfer.
* **Transparent pricing:** You connect to resources on-demand. The pricing model is similar to standard Cloud Instances: you pay for the compute resources allocated during your simulation time.

## Accessing Aer via Scaleway

To run your remote emulator, you simply need to switch your Qiskit backend to a Scaleway-hosted emulator.

<Requirements />

* A Scaleway account with a valid **Project ID**.
* A Scaleway **API Key** (Secret Key).
* Python installed with `qiskit` and `qiskit-scaleway`.

### 2. Installation

```bash
pip install qiskit-scaleway
```

### 3. Running on QaaS
The following example demonstrates how to run a computation on a Scaleway GPU instance. The workflow is identical to using a local emulator, but the computation happens remotely.

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit_scaleway import ScalewayProvider

# 1. Initialize the Provider
# Ensure you have your credentials ready
provider = ScalewayProvider(
    project_id="your-project-id",
    secret_key="your-secret-key"
)

# 2. Select the Aer GPU Platform
# Example platform ID: 'EMU-AER-H100' (Aer emulator using an Nvidia H100 GPU)
backend = provider.get_backend("EMU-AER-H100")

# 3. Create a Quantum Circuit
# Let's create a Bell state with measurement
qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
qc.h(0)
qc.cx(0, 1)
qc.measure_all()

# 4. No transpilation
# Scaleway QaaS handles the transpilation server-side for you

# 5. Execute on remote emulator
# The job is sent to Scaleway, executed on the GPU, and results are returned compressed.
job = backend.run(qc, shots=10000)

# 6. Get Results
result = job.result()

print("Results:", result)
```

### 4. Understanding Platforms & billing
Scaleway offers different "Platforms" for emulation, ranging from standard CPU instances to high-end GPU clusters.

* **Platform selection**: When you choose a backend (e.g., EMU-AER-H100), Scaleway dynamically allocates the requested resource.
* **Session & billing**: Behind the scenes, a Session is created for your computation. Unlike QPU "shots", emulation is typically billed based on the duration of resource usage (similar to renting a cloud instance). This makes it cost-effective for running massive batches of shots or debugging complex algorithms.
* **End of billing**: It stops when you terminate your Session or after a timeout.

<Message type="tip"> Performance Tip: The service automatically handles data compression. This is particularly useful when running algorithms like QML (Quantum Machine Learning) or Variational Algorithms (VQE/QAOA) where large amounts of parameters and results are exchanged between the classical client and the quantum backend. </Message>
