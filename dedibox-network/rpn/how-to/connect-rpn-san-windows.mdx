  <Message type="tip">

  For a 1 TB SAN, keep the default choice. If you have a larger SAN, select GPT, Windows can not handle partitions larger than 2 TB with anything except GPT.

6. Format the disk with a file system (NTFS). Click **Next** > **Finish** to confirm formating the disk.

Once finished formatting (in about 10 minutes using quick formatting), the hard disk drive should be accessible from the server manager as a regular disk:
