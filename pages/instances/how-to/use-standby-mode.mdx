[Standby mode](/instances/concepts/#standby-mode) temporarily stops an Instance. The Instance remains allocated to your account and all data remains on the Local Storage of the Instance.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/)

## How to put an Instance into standby mode

1. Click **CPU & GPU Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The [Instances page](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) displays.
2. Select the Availability Zone (AZ) from the drop-down menu (e.g., `PAR1`) to view resources in the selected AZ.
3. Click the Instance you want to put into standby mode. The Overview page for that Instance displays.
4. Scroll down to the **Standby mode** section

6. Click **Switch Instance to standby mode** to confirm.

    Your Instance is now in standby mode.

  Alternatively, you can put your Instance into standby mode from the terminal by typing the `poweroff` command. This will shut down your Instance and switch it to standby mode.

<Message type="important">
  You are still billed for an Instance in standby mode, as well as for its storage and any flexible IPs attached to it. To avoid being charged for an unused Instance, you can [power it off](/instances/how-to/power-off-instance/). <br /><br />
