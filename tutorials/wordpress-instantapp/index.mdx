## WordPress InstantApp - Overview

WordPress is a popular, free and open source blogging tool and a content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL.

Working with the WordPress application will significantly save you time and effort as WordPress is installed and configured.

This page shows you how to spawn a WordPress application in seconds.

 We recommend you follow this tutorial using a [Learning Instance](/compute/instances/reference-content/choosing-instance-type/).
</Message>

<Message type="note">
  The WordPress InstantApp comes with the following packages:
  ```
  nginx
  mysql-server
  php-cli
  php-fpm
  php-mysql
  pwget
  ```
  The underlying operating system used is Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa), so the package versions are those available on this distribution.

## Auto-install functionality

The WordPress image comes with a new `auto-install` functionality which allows you to create a WordPress Instance using a few well-defined tags.
Tags allow you to provide basic information needed to have a fully working WordPress Instance.

To trigger the auto-install functionality, two mandatory tags are required for full automation:

- `admin_user_name`
- `admin_email`

Optional tags such as `weblog_title`and `language` can also be used to add more customization to the Weblog.

<Message type="note">
  The value for the `language` tag must adhere to the [list of WordPress locale codes](https://wpastra.com/docs/complete-list-wordpress-locale-codes)
</Message>

A random password will be generated and will be accessible when you log into your Instance with your SSH key.
When defining the `weblog_title` tag on the console, it is not possible to have spaces in the title of the weblog. This is only feasible when using the CLI. Refer to our tutorial on [creating a WordPress Instance using the Scaleway CLI](/tutorials/create-wordpress-instances-cli) to create an Instance with the Scaleway CLI.

### Deploy WordPress

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu and click **Create an Instance**.
2. Choose the **WordPress** image in the **InstantApps** tab.
3. Choose the server type and click **Create Instance**.

### Open the mail ports to send emails

To avoid spam, remote mail ports cannot be reached from our infrastructure by default. As WordPress requires sending mail, we need to open them. Your account needs to be validated to perform this operation. [Contact our assistance](https://console.scaleway.com/support/) to get your account reviewed.

1. Click the **Security groups** tab to enter the security-groups page.
2. Click **Create a new security group** and enter the security group's name and description.

3. Check the **Enable SMTP** box to unblock the mail ports.

4. Select your WordPress Instance to apply the security group configuration to.
5. Click **Create a new security group**.

## Configure WordPress

Go back to the list of your Instances and click on your WordPress Instance. Copy your Instance's public IP address and paste it in your browser.

On the page you land, fill-in the WordPress information and click **Install WordPress**.
