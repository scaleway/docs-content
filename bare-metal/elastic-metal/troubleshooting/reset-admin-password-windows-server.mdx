During the installation or reinstallation of an Elastic Metal server with a Windows Server operating system, an administrator password is set by you (Administrator account).

If you have lost this password, you can reset it via rescue mode.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An Elastic Metal server [installed](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/quickstart/#how-to-create-an-elastic-metal-server)

## Removing the old Administrator password

1. Reboot your Elastic Metal server into [rescue mode](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/use-rescue-mode/).
2. Log into rescue mode.
3. Install the packages `ntfs-3g` and `chntpw` using the APT package manager.
    ```
    sudo apt install ntfs-3g chntpw
    ```
4. Mount the Windows system partition.
    ```
    sudo ntfsfix /dev/sda2
    ```
5. List the user accounts configured in Windows:
    ```
    sudo chntpw -l /mnt/Windows/System32/config/SAM
    ```
    An output similar to the following displays:
    ```
    chntpw version 1.00 140201, (c) Petter N Hagen
    Hive </mnt/Windows/System32/config/SAM> name (from header): <\SystemRoot\System32\Config\SAM>
    ROOT KEY at offset: 0x001020 * Subkey indexing type is: 686c <lh>

    ```
    <Message type="tip">
      The administrator account of your server can either be `Administrator` or `Administrateur` depending on the installation.
    </Message>
6. Edit the `Administrator` account by running the following command:
    ```
    sudo chntpw -u Administrator /mnt/Windows/System32/config/SAM
    ```
    A menu displays as follows:
    ```

9. Type `y` and press `Enter` to confirm the writing of the files.
    ```

    ```
10. Reboot the server back into [normal mode](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/use-rescue-mode/#how-to-reboot-into-normal-mode).

## Setting a new Administrator password

1. [Activate remote access](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/activate-remote-access/) on your server to be able to connect to it using the KVM over IP device.
2. Open the remote console to visualize the screen output of your machine.
3. Open the start menu and click the `Administrator` username to open the user settings.
4. Click the password panel, then **Add** to configure a new password.
5. Enter a password, its confirmation and a reminder, then validate.
6. Exit the remote console.
    You can now log into your machine using the Remote Desktop Viewer and your newly set password.
