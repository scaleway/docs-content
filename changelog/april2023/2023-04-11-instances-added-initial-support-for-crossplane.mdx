We added initial support for the Scaleway Crossplane provider. 

Scaleway is now listed on the [official Upbound repository](https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers/scaleway/provider-scaleway/v0.1.0)

Refer to the [Scaleway Crossplaine Provider repository](https://github.com/scaleway/crossplane-provider-scaleway) for more information.
