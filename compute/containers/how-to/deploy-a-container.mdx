This page shows you how to deploy your first Scaleway Elements Container. A container is a package of software that includes all dependencies: code, runtime, configuration, and system libraries so that it can run on any host system. This allows you to control your production environment. Scaleway provides you with custom Docker images that are entirely handled for you in the cloud. With Containers, you can rely on your favorite technologies such as Django or Ruby On Rails.

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created a Containers namespace](/compute/containers/how-to/create-a-containers-namespace/)
  - You have [created a Container Registry namespace](/compute/container-registry/how-to/create-namespace/) and [pushed a Container image](/compute/containers/how-to/deploy-a-container/) to it

</Message>

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The Containers page displays.

2. Click the relevant Containers namespace. 

3. Click **Deploy a Container**. The Container creation wizard displays.

4. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 

    - Choose an **image** from your Container Registry. Select the required Container Registry Namespace from the dropdown list, and then select the container and tag.
    - Choose a **name** for your container, and optionally a **description**. The name must only contain alphanumeric characters.
    - Choose the **resources** to be allocated to your container at runtime. These define the performance characteristics of your container.
    - Set your **scaling** preferences, or leave them at default values. The Scaleway platform autoscales the number of available instances of your container to match the incoming load, depending on the settings you define here.
    - Define any **environment variables** you want to inject into your container. For each environment variable, click **+Add** and enter the key/value pair.
    - Set the desired **privacy policy** for your container. This defines whether container invocation may be done anonymously (**public**) or only via an authentication mechanism provided by Scaleway (**private**). 
    - Optionally, use the **advanced options** to add [triggers](/compute/containers/concepts/#trigger) to your container deployment. Adding triggers enables the container to handle events coming from sources other than an HTTP endpoint, such as CRON (time-based jobs), MQTT queues and more. 
    - Verify the **Estimated Cost**.

5. Click **Deploy a container** to finish.
