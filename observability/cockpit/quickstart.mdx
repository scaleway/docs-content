Scaleway Observability allows you to monitor your applications and their infrastructure by giving you insights and context into their behavior. Observability also enables you to visualize your metrics and logs through a Grafana dashboard.

In this Quickstart, we show you how to activate your Cockpit, how to retrieve your Grafana credentials and how to connect to Grafana and access your [managed dashboards](observability/cockpit/concepts/#managed-dashboards). When you are done using the Cockpit, you can also deactivate it.
