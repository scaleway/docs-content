## Discourse - Overview

[Discourse](https://www.discourse.org) is an open source Internet forum software application. Discourse is different to existing forum software by including features recently popularized by large social networks. The application is written with Ember.js and Ruby on Rails. The backend database management system used by Discourse is PostgreSQL.

The source code is distributed under the [GNU General Public License version 2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html) and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/discourse/discourse).

This tutorial will guide you to set up discourse using the official [Docker image](https://github.com/discourse/discourse_docker). The Docker container contains everything that is required to run Discourse and makes it much easier to deploy, administer and upgrade the software.

## Installing Discourse

1. Log into your instance using [SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance).
2. Update the `apt` packet cache and upgrade the software already installed on the instance to the latest version available in Ubuntu's Repositories:
    ```
    apt update && apt ugprade -y
    ```
3. Install packages required for Discourse:
    ```
    apt install -y git netcat
    ```
4. Clone the Discourse Docker repository into the local directory `/var/discourse`:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse_docker.git /var/discourse
    ```
5. Enter the locally cloned repository:
    ```
    cd /var/discourse
    ```
6. Run the Discourse setup:
    ```
    ./discourse-setup
    ```

    <Message type="important">
      It is **required** that:
        - a valid (sub-)domain is pointed to your instance. **Discourse will not work from an IP address**. If you do not have a domain name yet, you can [order one](https://www.online.net/en/domain) now. Create a subdomain like `discourse.mydomain.com` or `forum.mydomain.com` for your Discourse instance.
        - you have an SMTP server available to send out emails from Discourse. You can either configure [an own SMTP server](/tutorials/setup-postfix-ubuntu-bionic) or use an SMTP service like [SendInBlue](https://www.sendinblue.com/) or [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com/). Make sure that the Instance's [SMTP ports are enabled](https://www.scaleway.com/en/faq/why-can-i-not-send-any-email/). **Discourse will not work if it can not send emails**.
    </Message>
7. Answer the following questions:
    ```
    Hostname for your Discourse? [discourse.example.com]:
    Email address for admin account(s)? [me@example.com,you@example.com]:
    SMTP server address? [smtp.example.com]:
    SMTP port? [587]:
    SMTP user name? [user@example.com]:
    SMTP password? [pa$$word]:
    Let's Encrypt account email? (ENTER to skip) [me@example.com]:
    ```
8. Once all details are entered, a `app.yml` configuration file is being generated on your behalf before bootstrapping the installation. Note that the installation of Discourse may take up to 10 minutes depending on your instance type.

## Configuring the admin user

1. Once the installation is complete, open your web browser and go to your discourse subdomain (i.e. `https://discourse.example.com`). The configuration wizard displays. Click **Register** to create the first (admin) user:

2. Enter an identifier and a secret password for the new user. Make sure that your email address is valid, as you will receive a confirmation link in this mailbox. Click **Register** to continue:

3. Check your email inbox and click the link to confirm your email address and finish the creation of the admin user.
