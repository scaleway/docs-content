This page shows you how to generate [API keys](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#api-key) with IAM to send [transactional emails](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#transactional-email) via API and SMTP.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />
 
<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/).
  - You are the Owner of your Organization, or an IAM user in an Organization where you have the [IAMManager](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/) permission set.
  - You have a domain name.
  - You have [configured your domain with Transactional Email](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/configure-domain-with-transactional-email).
  - You have added [SPF, DKIM](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/add-spf-dkim-records-to-your-domain) and [MX records](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/add-mx-record-to-your-domain/) to your domain.

## Generate an API key using IAM and send emails via the API

To send your emails via the API, a valid API key and your Project ID are required.

1. [Create an IAM application](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-application/).
2. [Create a policy](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-policy/) giving appropriate [permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/) to carry out actions for Transactional Email in the desired Project(s), with the IAM application attached as a principal.
3. [Create an API key for your application](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/#how-to-create-an-api-key-for-an-iam-application).
    <Message type="important">
     Make sure you save your secret and access keys as you will need them in the following step.
    </Message>
4. Open a terminal on your computer and type the following command to send an email via the API:

```
cat > mail.json <<EOF
{
    "from": {
        "name": "Alice",
        "email": "alice@my.domain.example.com"
    },
    "to": [
        {
        "name": "Bob",
        "email": "bob@caramail.fr"
        }
    ],
    "subject": "Some subject",
    "text": "Some text.",
    "html": "<p>Some <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">HTML</span>.</p>",
    "project_id": "<project-id>",
    "attachments": [
        {
            "name": "file.html",
            "type": "text/html; charset=\"utf8\"",
            "content": "PCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw+CjxodG1sIGxhbmc9ImVuIj4KICAgIDxoZWFkPgogICAgICAgIDxtZXRhIGNoYXJzZXQ9InV0Zi04Ij4KICAgICAgICA8dGl0bGU+dGl0bGU8L3RpdGxlPgogICAgPC9oZWFkPgogICAgPGJvZHk+CiAgICAgICAgPHA+SGVsbG8gPHNwYW4gc3R5bGU9ImNvbG9yOmJsdWUiPndvcmxkPC9zcGFuPiE8L3A+CiAgICA8L2JvZHk+CjwvaHRtbD4="
        }
    ]
}
EOF

curl -X POST "https://api.scaleway.com/transactional-email/v1alpha1/regions/$REGION/emails" \
-H "X-Auth-Token: $TOKEN" \
-d @mail.json
```
<Message type="important">
 - If you have not configured your environment in your local machine, make sure you replace `\<project_id\>` with your [Project ID](/console/my-project/concepts/#project), `$REGION` with `fr-par` and `$TOKEN` with your secret key. If you do not replace the Project ID, the API displays a "permission denied" error message.
 - Make sure you replace the email addresses with yours and your recipient's
</Message>

The following output should display:

```
{"emails":[{"id":"655c27f2-b2a3-4a9f-8e1f-3e6dc268b1c4","message_id":"3d928e21-187a-4539-b303-403156e37911","project_id":"3e44a89e-1f75-45f5-9b93-422db94165eb","mail_from":"alice@my.domain.example.com","rcpt_to":"bob@caramail.fr","rcpt_type":"to","created_at":"2022-08-01T07:55:36.758671147Z","updated_at":"2022-08-01T07:55:36.758671147Z","status":"new","status_details":"not yet processed","try_count":0,"last_tries":[]}]}%
```

## Generate an API key using IAM to send emails via SMTP

The Transactional Email SMTP relay is available at `smtp.tem.scw.cloud` on ports `25`, `587`, `2587` (non TLS), `465` and `2465` (TLS). To send your emails using SMTP, a valid API secret key and your Project ID are required.

1. [Generate an API key](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/generate-api-keys-for-tem-with-iam#generate-an-api-key-using-iam-and-send-emails-via-the-api) as shown above.
2. Authenticate yourself to the server using your Project ID as username.
3. Use your secret key as password and start sending emails.

<Message type="important">
 You can only use the `PLAIN` authentication method for now, as other methods are not supported.
