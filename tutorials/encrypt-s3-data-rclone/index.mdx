## Rclone crypt - Overview

[Rclone](https://rclone.org/) is an open-source command-line tool to manage files on cloud storages. It is written in the [Go](https://golang.org) programming language and supports a wide range of protocols. The tool provides virtual backends to wrap local and cloud file systems to apply encryption, caching, chunking and joining.

Rclone is available for Windows, macOS X and various Linux distributions.

In this tutorial we will have a look on the [rlcone crypt](https://rclone.org/crypt/) module to encrypt your data before sending it to [Scaleway Object Storage](https://www.scaleway.com/en/object-storage/) via the S3 protocol.

## Configuring a S3 remote endpoint

<Message type="important">

You need to have your [API key](/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key/) ready for the `rclone` configuration.

</Message>

Before encrypting your data, create a new remote S3 endpoint in rclone using the `rclone config` command:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/r/c/s/q> n
name> scaleway
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").

Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
secret_access_key> <SECRET_KEY>
Region to connect to.
Leave blank if you are using an S3 clone and you don't have a region.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / Use this if unsure. Will use v4 signatures and an empty region.
   \ ""
 2 / Use this only if v4 signatures don't work, eg pre Jewel/v10 CEPH.
   \ "other-v2-signature"
region> fr-par
Endpoint for S3 API.
Required when using an S3 clone.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value

### Configuring rclone crypt

`rclone crypt` will use the previously configured endpoint to store the encrypted files. Configure it by running `rclone config` again.

In the config below we define the Object Storage bucket at the `remote` prompt. In our example, we use our S3 endpoint `scaleway` with the bucket `myobjectstoragebucket`. 

Edit these values towards your configuration. A long passphrase is recommended for security reasons, or you can use a random one.

```
$ rclone config
Current remotes:

Name                 Type
====                 ====
scaleway             s3


e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/r/c/s/q> n
name> secret
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[...]
10 / Encrypt/Decrypt a remote
   \ "crypt"

### Sending encrypted data

You can send encrypted data to your Object Storage bucket using the `secret` endpoint which acts like a proxy, encrypting your data, before uploading it into your bucket.

For example, if you want to upload your personal photo album and want to protect your privacy, you can encrypt the files in the directory by running the following command:

```
$ rclone copy --progress --s3-chunk-size=20M /home/myuser/MyPhotoalbum secret:/encrypted/MyPhotoalbum
```

It will transfer the directory `/home/myuser/MyPhotoalbum` to the endpoint `secret` and upload the data in the sub-directory `/encrypted/MyPhotoalbum`. The flags `--progress` display the status of the file transfer and `--s3-chunk-size=20` sets the maximum size for each part of a [multipart upload](/storage/object/api-cli/multipart-uploads) to 20MB.

You can check if the data has been encrypted when running a `ls` command on the `scaleway` endpoint. It will return a list like the following:

```
$ rclone -q ls scaleway:myobjectstoragebucket
      552 3o60qe8adn5et0u45v2tidlrps/1qam1krvtvh27lapdj6s1uqbs8
     2725 3o60qe8adn5et0u45v2tidlrps/1sourbh9g9fhed0qno6uc448sdgp4okr89hvba7tsbb72oekgc70
     8244 3o60qe8adn5et0u45v2tidlrps/47bofkrpan3ppnmapi5j724jeg
    46202 3o60qe8adn5et0u45v2tidlrps/5su2ovf4mpcpgis5sll65iloasrshulp7drbpjrlpfobhh8k8qvg
    34607 3o60qe8adn5et0u45v2tidlrps/dredhm7otgba2s25nbdq2chqtpbvcqq2oum1b404mpim24dfg5ig
```

If you run the same command on the `secret` endpoint, `rclone crypt` will decrypt the files and return their actual names:

```
$ rclone -q ls secret:
      504 Pictures/Picture1.png
     2677 Pictures/Picture2.png
     8196 Pictures/Picture3.png
    46154 Pictures/Picture4.png
    34559 Pictures/Picture5.png
```

Note that `rclone crypt` keeps the directory structure, but encrypts both the file and folder names.

### Restoring encrypted data

Decryption of data stored using `rclone copy` works the same way as the encryption process:

```
rclone copy --progress secret:/encrypted/MyPhotoalbum /home/myuser/restored_data/MyPhotoalbum
```

You are now able to encrypt and decrypt your data on Scaleway Object Storage using `rclone crpyt`. For more information about the `crypt` endpoint, refer to the official [rclone documentation](https://rclone.org/crypt/).
