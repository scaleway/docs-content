Apache OpenSearch allows you to research, analyze, and visualize all your unstructured data with an open-source search and analytics suite. It provides a fully-managed NoSQL database service to perform full-text searches and visualize results.

Cloud Essentials for OpenSearch is a managed solution to quickly deploy a robust database search engine that can be distributed across several nodes for enhanced performance and high availability.

This guide covers the basic steps to set up, log in to, and delete a Cloud Essentials for OpenSearch deployment.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
