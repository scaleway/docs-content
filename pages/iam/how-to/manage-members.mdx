## How to create a Member

1. Click **IAM & API keys** on the top-right drop-down menu of the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) displays.
2. Click **+ Add user**. A pop-up displays.
3. Enter the username of the Member you want to add to your Organization.
    <Message type="important">
      When you create a Member, a Scaleway account is created for them. They exist only within your Organization. If you delete the Member, their account is also deleted. Make sure you inform your Members that [logging into an Organization as a Member](/iam/how-to/log-in-as-a-member) is different from [logging in as an Owner](/account/how-to/log-in-to-the-console).
    </Message>
4. (Optional) Add a password.
    <Message type="note">
      If you set a password, make sure you keep note of it to share it with the Member later. The password will only be shown once. If password renewal is enforced in the Organization, from their first login, the Member must update their password. They must comply with this security requirement within the [grace period](/iam/concepts#grace-period) defined for your Organization.
    </Message>
5. (Optional) Check the box if you want to send the password to the Member via email.
6. Click **Next**.
7. Enter the Member's email address.
8. (Optional) Check the box if you want to send a welcome email to the Member.
9. (Optional) Enter the first and last name of the member.
10. (Optional) Assign the member to an existing [IAM group](/iam/concepts/#group)
11. Click **Create Member**.

    <Message type="important">
      If you did not send a welcome email to the Member, make sure you give them their login information.
      The following link allows them to see the log in screen only for your Organization: `https://account.scaleway.com/member-login?organization=[orgid]`. You must replace `[orgid]` with your Organization ID.
    </Message>

## How to access the Member overview

1. Click **IAM & API keys** on the top-right drop-down menu of the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) displays.
    <Lightbox image={image} alt="" />
2. Click the name of the user you want to manage. Alternatively, click <Icon name="more" /> next to the user, and select **Overview**. Either way, you are taken to the user's **Overview** tab.
    Follow the steps below depending on the management action you wish to take.

## How to view Member information

From the user's [Overview tab](#how-to-access-the-user-overview), you can view information such as:

    - **User details** - The user's type (Owner or Member), status, **created on** date, whether they have [MFA](/account/concepts/#multifactor-authentication-mfa) enabled, and the date of their last login.
    - **User profile** - The user's username, first and last names, email address, telephone number, preferred language, and their Scaleway ID number.

<Lightbox image={image2} alt="" />

In the Overview tab, you can also find an extensive list of the user's permission sets, the name of their associated policies and the scope they apply to.

## How to lock a Member

As an Owner or user with IAM Manager permissions, you can lock a Member anytime.

<Message type="important">
  Locking is an action that only applies to IAM Members. Keep in mind that:
      - Once a Member is locked, they cannot log into the Organization, but are not removed from it.
      - Any API keys attached to a Member lose their permissions when the Member is locked.

  If a Member fails to [comply with security requirements](/iam/how-to/log-in-as-a-member#how-to-comply-with-security-requirements) by the end of the [grace period](/iam/concepts#grace-period), they are automatically locked and are not able to connect to the Organization until they are manually unlocked.
