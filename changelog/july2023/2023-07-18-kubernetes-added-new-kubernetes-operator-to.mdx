NVIDIA's [GPU operator](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/overview.html) is installed by default on all new GPU pools, automatically bringing required software on your GPU worker nodes. 

Find out how to activate or configure the operator on the [documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/containers/kubernetes/how-to/use-kubernetes-gpu-operator/).
