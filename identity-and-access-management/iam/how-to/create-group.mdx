An IAM group is a grouping of users and/or applications. Groups allow you to attach [policies](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#policy) to multiple users at the same time.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

1. Click **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** from your [**Organization Dashboard**](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) in the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) displays.

2. Click the **Groups** tab. A list of the Organization's existing IAM groups displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-groups-overview.webp" alt="" />
3. Click **+ Create group**. The group creation wizard displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-group.webp" alt="" />
4. Complete the steps of the creation wizard:
    - Enter a **name** for the group, or use the auto-generated name suggested for you,
    - Add a tag (optional),
    <Message type="note">
      Tags are key/value pairs that help you organize your users. Keep in mind that:
      - You can assign up to 10 tags per user
      - Tag values must be between 1 and 70 characters long, including `key` and `value`
      - The same tag cannot be used twice
    </Message>
    - Enter a **description** (optional),
    - Add **members** to the group (optional) by first selecting the type of member you want to add (user or application) and then selecting the specific user or application from the drop-down list. Click **Add another member** and repeat the process until you have added all the members you want,
    - Attach an existing **policy** to the group (optional). The members of the group will benefit from the access rights defined in this policy. Alternatively, you can choose not to attach a policy now and do so at a later stage.
5. Click **Create group** to finish.

    You are returned to the list of your groups, where your newly created group now appears.
