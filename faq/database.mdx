## What is Scaleway Database?


Scaleway Database provides fully-managed relational database Instances, supporting the database engines PostgreSQL and MySQL.

The product lets you focus on development, rather than administration or configuration. It comes with high-availability mode, data replication, and automatic backups.

In comparison to traditional database management, which requires customers to provision their infrastructure and resources to manage their databases, Scaleway Database offers the user access to a database instance without the need for setting up the hardware or configuring the software. Scaleway handles the provisioning, manages the configuration, and provides useful features as high availability, Automated Backup, User management, and more.


## How can I access my database once it is provisioned?


On the details page of your Instance, the IP address and your Instance’s port are shown:

<Lightbox src="scaleway_database1.webp" alt="" />

It is possible to connect to your Instance from any application using the IP address and port shown in the **Endpoint** section and the login/password of any valid database user. This can be managed from the “users” tab.

## How can I manage my databases? 

You can [create a MySQL database](/webhosting/classic/how-to/create-mysql-database/),[manage your MySQL database with PHPmyAdmin](/webhosting/classic/how-to/manage-mysql-database-phpmyadmin/) or [delete your MySQL database](/webhosting/classic/how-to/delete-mysql-database/). You can also [create](/webhosting/classic/how-to/create-postgresql-database/), [manage](/webhosting/classic/how-to/manage-postgresql-database-adminer/) or [delete](/webhosting/classic/how-to/delete-postgresql-database/) PostgreSQL databases. 

See our documentation on [upgrading a Database for PostgreSQL](/tutorials/upgrade-managed-postgresql-database/).



**PostgreSQL** 

To access your Scaleway Database for PostgreSQL Instance, use the psql command-line tool with the following command:
```psql -h $IP -p $PORT -U $YOUR_USER -d $DATABASE_NAME```
You will have to enter your password to establish the connection. The default `$DATABASE_NAME` to be used is `rdb`.


**MySQL**

You can access your Scaleway Database for MySQL Instance with the following command:

```mysql -h $IP --port $PORT -p -u $USERNAME```
You will be prompted to enter your password to log in.


## How do I import data into a Scaleway Database?


**PostgreSQL**

To import data into your Scaleway Database for PostgreSQL, export your data using the `pg_dump` command in a first step:

```pg_dump -h OLD_DB_IP -p OLD_DB_PORT -U OLD_DB_USERNAME -F c -b -v -f "/usr/local/backup/database.backup" DATABASE_NAME```

Once the data is exported, import the database using the pg_restore command:

```pg_restore -h INSTANCE_IP -p INSTANCE_PORT -U USERNAME -d DATABASE_NAME -v "/usr/local/backup/database.backup"```

The different parameters used in the commands represent the following values:

`-h` (--host): IP address of the host
`-p` (--port): Port number of the host
`-U` (--username): PostgreSQL user
`-F` (--format): Format
`c:` c just after a -F means that the format is the binary format specific to postgreSQL
`-b` (--blobs): Specifies the binary string type
`-v` (--verbose)
`-f` (--file): Specifies the file name

**MySQL**

If you want to import your existing database into a Scaleway Database for MySQL, start by exporting your data using the command `mysqldump`:

```mysqldump -u username -p old_database > backup.sql```
Then import the backup into your Scaleway Database for `MySQL`:

```mysql -u username -p new_database < backup.sql```


## Which postgreSQL extensions are available?

The following `pg_extensions` are available for Scaleway Database:

## How do I backup my database?


If the automatic backup feature is enabled, new backups will be created according to your backup schedule, which can be set on the "Instance overview” tab. Your Instance is available during backup, but there might be a performance impact and some actions may not be available.
Automatic backups are enabled by default. It is possible to disable them at any time in the backup settings of your Instance. 
It is also possible to launch manual backups by clicking on the **Create a backup** button from the backups tab.

## Are my active and standby database nodes in a high-availability cluster hosted in the same datacenter?

In a high-availability cluster, active and hot standby nodes are indeed located in the same datacenter but in two separated racks.  
The idea is to offer the best performance to ours users by reducing latency between active and hot standby nodes, as we use a sync replication process between the nodes.

## What is the Private Networks feature for Database Instances?

[Private Networks](/network/vpc/quickstart/) allows you to configure your own Layer-2 network with IPv4 adresses. You can therefore enhance the security of your system architecture by isolating it from the Internet. 

This feature introduces a significant change in the architecture of Scaleway's Databases: when using Private Networks, your application connects directly to your Database nodes, without going through a Load Balancer. 
This improves performance by reducing the latency between your nodes. It also increases the security of your databases, since Instances in your Private Network can directly to your Database Instance, without passing through the public Internet.

You can create new Database Instances to attach to your Private Network, or attach existing Database Instances by adding Private Networks endpoints to them. 

## How many Private Networks can I attach? 

Currently, you can connect one Private Network to each Database Instance.

## Can I use any IP Range for my Private Network? 

For now, only the [RFC1918](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918) IP subnets are accepted as Database Instances virtual IPv4.

## How is the Database's private failover IP managed?

The virtual IPv4 used to expose the Database Instance service is automatically routed to the new promoted node and announced within 10s to the neighboring Compute Instances.

## Can I remove the Load Balancer endpoint from my Database Instance?

You can not remove the Load Balancer endpoint from your Database Instance, but you can block all access by emptying the allowed IPs list from the console or via the API.

## Can I limit the IPs allowed to reach my Database Instance on a Private Network?

It is not possible to limit access to a Database Instance on a Private Network. We recommend that you create a dedicated Private Network for your Database Instances and add only the relevant middleware application Instances to this Private Network.

## Can I add an IPv6 to my Database Instance?

IPv6 is not supported with Private Networks on Database Instances.

## In what regions is the Private Networks feature available for Databases for PostgreSQL and MySQL 

Private Networks is available for PostgreSQL and MySQL Database Instances in PAR1, AMS1 and WAW1.

Currently, you cannot connect PAR2 or PAR3 Instances to a Database Instance located in the **Paris** region using Private Networks.

| RDB Region         	| Private Network Region                                                                               	|

## Can I assign a Database virtual IP with DHCP?

No, you need to provide a static IPv4 with CIDR notation on the same subnet as the one configured on your Private Network.

<Message type="tip">

You can use the Database virtual IP (VIP) in a DHCP-controlled environnement by [reserving the IP](/network/vpc/how-to/configure-a-public-gateway/#how-to-review-and-configure-dhcp) in the DHCP server configuration to be sure it is not assigned to any other Instance, then configure it on the Private Networks endpoint.

</Message>

## How to update my Service IP once the endpoint created?
You need to delete and recreate the endpoint with the new Service IP

## What should I use as virtual IP? How do I calculate the CIDR netmask?

[CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) is the shortest notation containing required information to configure the endpoint: IP address and network mask.
The network mask part is required for IP routing purposes. You may use a [network calculator](https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr) if required.

Examples:

| Network Address 	| Netmask (Dotted Quad) 	| Netmask (CIDR) 	| First usable host IP address 	| Last usable host IP address 	| Example VIP      	|
|-----------------	|-----------------------	|----------------	|------------------------------	|-----------------------------	|------------------	|
| 192.168.0.0/24  	| 255.255.255.0         	| 24             	| 192.168.0.1                  	| 192.168.0.254               	| 192.168.0.33/24  	|
