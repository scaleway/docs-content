## Problem

I am experiencing issues with the lifecycle rules of my Scaleway Object Storage bucket.

## Cause

- Lifecycle rules are not properly set

- Spaces are present in the prefixes or tags of your objects

- You reached the limit of 500,000 lifecycle jobs per day

## Possible solutions

- Make sure that [lifecycle rules are properly set](/object-storage/how-to/manage-lifecycle-rules/) in the Scaleway console.

- Make sure that the prefixes and tags of your objects do not contain any spaces.

- If you reached the limit of 500,000 jobs per day, you can [transition](/object-storage/how-to/edit-storage-class/) or [delete](/object-storage/how-to/delete-an-object/) objects manually.

- For expiration rules, you can use the [HeadObject](/object-storage/api-cli/object-operations/#headobject) command to check which rule is applied to a specific object. The `x-amz-expiration` header should return the expiration date and rule ID.

## Going further

- Refer to the [lifecycle rules documentation](/object-storage/how-to/manage-lifecycle-rules/) for more information.

- If you did not manage to identify the error and solve it by yourself, [open a support ticket](/account/how-to/open-a-support-ticket/), and provide as many details as possible, along with the necessary information below:
    - Object Storage Endpoint (e.g. `s3.fr-par.scw.cloud`)
    - Bucket name
    - Object name (if the request concerns an object)
    - Request type (PUT, GET, etc.)
    - HTTP status code
    - Date and time (timestamp)
    - User-agent (SDK, client, console, etc.)
    - Transaction ID (if possible)
    - Log / trace of the error (if possible)
