<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created an Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)
</Message>

When you delete a bucket, every object stored inside it is deleted as well.

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the name of your selected bucket in the buckets list.

    <Message type="important">
      Deleting a bucket will also delete all of its objects. For safety measures, the effective deletion of the bucket will start 24 hours after the deletion request. The bucket name will then be available for other customers to use.

      Once you confirm your deletion request, the bucket and all of its objects and versions will no longer be displayed in the console, nor available via the APIs. For this reason, we recommend you erase all objects and versions in the bucket before requesting the deletion, if you wish the bucket deletion to be effective immediately.

5. If you understand and agree to the conditions, type **DELETE** in the box and click **Delete bucket**.

     Files bigger than 1GB might take longer to be effectively deleted.
    </Message>
Alternatively, you can delete a bucket just by clicking the <Icon name="more" /> icon and then **Delete** in your bucket list.

Once the bucket is successfully deleted, it disappears from your bucket list.
