Scaleway Object Storage allows you to manage access to your resources with two features, [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#iam) and [Bucket policies](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/).

You can use IAM when you do not need to configure access to specific buckets, and favor simplicity over granularity. IAM is central, and relies on policies to manage a [principal](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#principal)'s rights in the entire Scaleway ecosystem.

Bucket policies operate at the bucket level, and enable you to state clearly who can do what in each bucket.

To configure more granular access to your Object Storage buckets, you can combine both IAM and bucket policies.

## Bucket policies and IAM overview

### IAM

[Identity and Access Management (IAM)](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#iam) allows you to control and manage access to your resources. For users of Scaleway Object Storage, this means that besides configuring access via bucket policies, you can use IAM policies to configure permissions at the Project level.

An [IAM policy](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#policy) is used to define the permissions of users, groups, and applications in a given Organization. A policy is composed of a [principal](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#principal) (the user, group or application to which it applies) and one or more IAM rules (which describe the permission sets the principal should have, and the scope of those permission sets).

If managing access to resources at the Project level is enough for your Object Storage use cases, use IAM only.

### Bucket policies

<Macro id="storage-bucket-policy" />

## Combining IAM and bucket policies

<Lightbox src="scaleway-bucket-policy-iam-table.webp" alt="" />

In order to perform actions on a bucket, a [principal](/storage/object/concepts/#principal) (user or application) must be granted access via an IAM policy, and optionally via a bucket policy.

By properly setting up IAM first, you can restrict access to Object Storage to the desired users and applications, and limit their allowed actions. By adding bucket policies to your critical resources, you can further restrain access and actions directly at the bucket-level, and achieve optimum security.

To set up granular access to your Object Storage resources, you must:

1. List all the users and applications you want to grant access to Object Storage, what rights you want to give them, and which buckets they can access.

2. [Create an IAM group](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-group/) that contains every user and application that must access Object Storage.

        You can create several groups to assign different permission sets to your users and applications.
    </Message>
3. [Create an IAM policy](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-policy/) for each group created, select the appropriate permission sets (e.g. `ObjectStorageReadOnly` or `ObjectStorageObjectsRead`), and [attach it to the group](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/manage-groups/#attach-a-policy-to-a-group). 

4. [Create and push a bucket policy](/storage/object/api-cli/create-bucket-policy/) in each bucket in which you want fine-grained access.

<Macro id="important-bucket-policy" />

## IAM and bucket policy example

Consider an Organization in which a user and an application must perform specific tasks with Scaleway Object Storage in a [project](/console/project/concepts/#project) named `S3-project`.

### Defining authorizations

- The user must be able to read ([GET](/storage/object/api-cli/object-operations/#getobject)) and write ([PUT](/storage/object/api-cli/object-operations/#putobject)) objects in a bucket A.

- The application must be able to read ([GET](/storage/object/api-cli/object-operations/#getobject)) objects in bucket A, and to write ([PUT](/storage/object/api-cli/object-operations/#putobject)) and [DELETE](/storage/object/api-cli/object-operations/#deleteobjects) objects in a bucket B.

### Setting up access

1. [Create a group](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-group/) named `S3-group` that contains the user and the application, so they are the only ones to have access to Object Storage.

2. [Create an IAM policy](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-policy/) named `S3-policy` in the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/), with the previously created group as a [principal](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#principal). The members of this group will have the `ObjectStorageFullAccess` right.
3. [Create a bucket policy](/storage/object/api-cli/create-bucket-policy/) to manage access to bucket A.
    ```json
    {
    "Version": "2023-04-17",
        "Id": "bucket-A-policy",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "Allow user to GET and PUT objects",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal":{
                "SCW":"user_id:<USER_ID>"
                },
                "Action": [
                    "s3:GetObject",
                    "s3:PutObject"
                ],
                "Resource": [
                    "bucket-A",
                    "bucket-A/*"
                ]
            },
            {
                "Sid": "Allow application to GET objects",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal":{
                "SCW":"application_id:<APPLICATION_ID>"
                },
                "Action": [
                    "s3:GetObject",
                ],
                "Resource": [
                    "bucket-A/*"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
4. [Create a bucket policy](/storage/object/api-cli/create-bucket-policy/) to manage access to bucket B.
    ```json
    {
    "Version": "2023-04-17",
        "Id": "bucket-B-policy",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "Allow application to PUT and DELETE objects",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal":{
                "SCW":"application_id:<APPLICATION_ID>"
                },
                "Action": [
                    "s3:PutObject",
                    "s3:DeleteObject",
                    "s3:DeleteObjects"
                ],
                "Resource": [
                    "bucket-B",
                    "bucket-B/*"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

5. [Push the policies](/storage/object/api-cli/create-bucket-policy/) to the corresponding buckets.

- The user can now GET and PUT in bucket A, and the application can now GET in bucket A

- The application can now PUT and DELETE in bucket B, and the user cannot perform any action as they are not **EXPLICITLY** allowed by the bucket policy.
