WAPS, or **W**hois **A**ccuracy **P**rogram **S**pecification, is a system introduced by the [ICANN](https://www.icann.org/) to validate the contact information of a domain name. ICANN requires that all registrars validate the identity and the continuity of the information entered in the contact of a domain name in order to have up-to-date information about the owners.

Domain owners are responsible for the use of their domain.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net) 
  - You have a domain registered with Scaleway
</Message>

1. Scaleway validates the information by sending an email to the owner's email address:
    ```
    Hello,

    You received this message because you are the current owner of
    domain names.

    As part of a mandatory process that is required by ICANN,
    we need to verify if your e-mail address is still being used as a domain name holder once a year and for each modification 
    of your e-mail validity use as a domain name holder.

    WARNING: Without a response from your end within 15 days, the verification fails and your domain names may get suspended. 
    fail and you risk the suspension of domain names.

    You have 15 days to confirm your e-mail address
    by simply clicking the following link.

    http://registrar.online.net/waps.cgi?

    We remind you the information when opening your account:

    Your e-mail    : xxxxxxxx@yyyyyyy.com
    Your telephone : +33.xxxxxxxxxx

    This procedure is about the following domain names:

            xxxxxx.com

    If you have questions about this process you can contact our
    helpdesk team at https://console.online.net/en/assistance/commercial
    but do not reply to this message. Messages received to this
    address are not read and therefore receive no answer

    ```
2. Click on the link in the email within 15 days to confirm that your email address is valid.
    <Message type="important">
      If you do not carry out this validation, you will not be able to renew your domain name. You may end up with a renewed hosting package, and no domain name. Since the domain is not renewed and no longer responds correctly on the Internet, the site will not be available.
    </Message>

<Message type="tip">
  If you are expecting a validation email (e.g. if you have modified your domain owner's contact information) but cannot find the email, try the following steps:
    - Check your SPAM folder
    - Check and update (if neccessary) the email address of your domain name contact from the [console](https://console.online.net/)
    - Open a ticket or contact the support team directly. They will be able to check to which address the validation email has been sent and whether it has been validated or not.
