Scaleway Serverless SQL Databases are fully managed databases that automatically scale both in storage and compute according to your workloads.

This page explains how to create, access and delete a Serverless SQL Database using the Scaleway console.

## How to create a database

1. Click **SQL Databases** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The Serverless SQL Databases page displays.

2. Click **+ Create database**. The database creation wizard displays.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Choose a **region**, which is the geographical location in which your database will be created.
    - Select a **default engine version** from the drop-down menu.
    - Configure your **database autoscaling**, or keep the default values. Your database will scale within the defined range to match the incoming load.

        Define a minimum of 1 vCPU or more to avoid cold starts that can take a few seconds.

    - Enter a **name** for your database, or keep the randomly generated name. The name must only contain alphanumeric characters and dashes.
    - Verify the **estimated cost**.
4. Click **Create database** to finish. The setting up of your database will take a few seconds. Check the **Overview** tab to see its status.

## How to connect to a database

1. From the **Overview** tab of your database, click the **Set up credentials** button. The setup wizard displays.

2. Select yourself as the [principal](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#principal) to connect to the database.

        Refer to the [IAM documentation](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/overview/) for more information on identities and access rights.

3. Set up the **Connection string**:
    - If you already have a secret key, replace the `[INSERT_SECRET_KEY_HERE]` placeholder with your key.
    - If you do not have a secret key, click **Generate new secret key**.
4. Copy your connection string and store it securely.

5. Run the following command in a terminal:

    ```bash
    psql "[YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING]"
    ```

    An output similar to the following response displays:

    ```bash
    psql (15.3, server 14.8 (Debian 14.8-1pgsg120+1))
    SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, compression: off)
    Type "help" for help.
    ```

6. Run the following command to see the version of your Serverless SQL Database:

    ```
    SELECT version ();
    ```

    An output similar to the following displays:

    ```
    PostgreSQL 14.8 (Debian 14.8-1.pgdg120+1) on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu,
    compiled by gcc (Debian 12.2.0-14) 12.2.0, 64-bit
    ```

7. Press `q` to quit the version overview.

You can now perform the authorized actions in the database.

## How to delete a database

1. Click **SQL Databases** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The Serverless SQL Databases page displays.

2. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the database you want to delete, and select **Delete** from the drop-down menu. A pop-up displays.

3. Type **DELETE**, then click **Delete database**.

<Message type="tip">
    - You can also delete a database from its **Overview** tab.
    - You can delete several databases by selecting the appropriate items from the **SQL databases** section and clicking the <Icon mane="delete" /> icon.
