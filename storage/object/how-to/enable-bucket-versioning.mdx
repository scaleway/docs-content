Once enabled, the versioning feature supports the retrieval of objects that are deleted or overwritten. It is a way to keep multiple variants of an object in the same bucket.

If the feature is enabled, you can list archived versions of an object or permanently delete an archived version. Once versioning is enabled, you cannot return to an un-versioned state of your bucket.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)  
  - You have [created an Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)

</Message>

<Message type="note">

  If you enable versioning, you will have several object versions. Keep in mind that each version of an object stored in your bucket takes up disk space and is billed.

  A pop-up appears to disclaim the following message:
  <Message type="important">

  Be careful! Enabling bucket versioning allows you to store several objects on a single key (every versioned object is billed). The activation is currently permanent and you will not be able to cancel it.

  </Message>
4. Click **Enable versioning on this bucket** if you agree and wish to proceed.

After confirmation, it is not possible to revert the action.
