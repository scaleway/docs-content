## Problem

I am experiencing issues while accessing my Serverless Containers.

## Possible causes
	
- The container returns a DNS error or issue
- The container response time is abnormally long
- The container returns a `HTTP 5xx` error
- The container returns a `Could not resolve host` error
- The container is in an error state

## Solutions

- If you encounter a DNS issue, refer to the [dedicated troubleshooting page](/serverless-containers/troubleshooting/known-dns-containers-errors/).

- For long response time, check:
    - if the first instance of the container is currently starting, a [cold start](/serverless-containers/concepts/#cold-start) can appear
    - if not, [check the metrics in Cockpit](/serverless-containers/how-to/monitor-container/) (especially CPU) and see if there is a high usage explaining the slow response

- `HTTP 5XX` errors can come from the application itself. Check if you can reproduce locally with a dummy container, or if your application is not misbehaving. 

- A `Could not resolve host` error can indicate that you are trying to reach the container in IPv4 with its IPv6 address, or vice versa. This can also appear if there is a [DNS issue](/serverless-containers/troubleshooting/known-dns-containers-errors/).

- If your container is in an `error` state:
    - Refer to the [dedicated troubleshooting page](/serverless-containers/troubleshooting/container-error-state/).
    - Check the `error_message` field in your [Cockpit logs](/serverless-containers/how-to/monitor-container/) to investigate the actual cause.
