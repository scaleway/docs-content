## How to use your domain's Email activity tab

 Your domain’s **Email activity** tab allows you to filter your emails, and list your filtered emails. It also provides you with additional information about your emails.

- The **Filter by** bar allows you to target emails sent to specific recipients or by specific senders.

- The **Period** drop-down allows you to target a time frame during which you have sent emails:

    - Last hour: displays all emails sent during the last hour
    - Last 24 hours: displays all emails sent during the last 24 hours
    - Last week: display all emails sent during the last week
    - Last month: displays all emails sent during the last month
    - Last year: displays all emails sent during the last calendar year

- The **Email status** drop-down allows you to target specific emails according to their **status** or their **flags**.
