GlusterFS is an open-source, scalable network filesystem suitable for high data-intensive workloads such as media streaming, cloud storage, and CDN (Content Delivery Network). Each storage server will be a mirror of the other storage server, and files will be replicated automatically across both storage servers.

This tutorial shows you how to:

## Configuring the Host File

Before installing `glusterfs` on all servers we need to configure the hosts' file and add the GlusterFS repository to each server.

1. [Connect to your server](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/) via SSH.
2. Update the apt-sources and the software already installed on the server.
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
3. Log in to each server and edit the `/etc/hosts` file.
    ```
    nano /etc/hosts
    ```
4. Paste hosts configuration below:
    ```
    ip_address gluster01
    ip_address gluster02
    ip_address client01
    ```
5. Save and exit.
6. Ping each server using the hostname as below:
    ```
    ping -c 3 gluster01
    ping -c 3 gluster02
    ping -c 3 client01
    ```
<Message type="note">
  If the `ping` command is not installed by default, you can install it with the `apt install iputils-ping` command.
</Message>

Each hostname will resolve to each server's IP address.

```
--- gluster01 ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2033ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.560/0.604/0.627/0.031 ms

--- gluster02 ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2050ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.497/0.593/0.688/0.080 ms

--- client01 ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2036ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.672/0.728/0.802/0.054 ms

```

## Adding the GlusterFS repository

Install the software-properties-common package to all systems.

```
apt install software-properties-common -y
```

Add the glusterfs key and repository to all systems.

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gluster/glusterfs-9
```

## Installing a GlusterFS server

1. Install the glusterfs server on both gluster01 and gluster02 servers.
    ```
    apt install glusterfs-server -y
    ```
2. Start the glusterd service and enable it to launch every time at system boot
    ```
    systemctl start glusterd.service
    systemctl enable glusterd.service
    ```

    Glusterfs server is now up and running on the `gluster01` and `gluster02` servers.
3. Check the services and the installed software version
    ```
    systemctl status glusterd.service
    glusterfsd --version
    ```

The command should return an `active (running)` status and `glusterfs 9.5` version.

## Configuring GlusterFS servers

The next step is configuring the servers by creating a trusted storage pool and creating a distributed glusterfs volume. 

- From the gluster01 server, we need to add the gluster02 server to the glusterfs storage pool.
    ```
    gluster peer probe gluster02
    ```

    The result `peer probe: success` is displayed. We added the gluster02 server to the storage trusted pool.
- Check the storage pool status and list.
    ```
    gluster peer status
    gluster pool list
    ```
    ```
    root@gluster01:~# gluster peer status
    Number of Peers: 1

    Hostname: gluster02
    Uuid: 17e7a76f-f616-42e5-b741-63a07fd091d6
    State: Peer in Cluster (Connected)
    root@gluster01:~# gluster pool list
    UUID					Hostname 	State
    17e7a76f-f616-42e5-b741-63a07fd091d6	gluster02	Connected
    ecc9cafa-b25d-477e-b6bc-403c051e752d	localhost	Connected
    ```

The gluster02 server is connected to the peer cluster, and it is on the pool list.

After creating the trusted storage pool, we will create a new distributed glusterfs volume. We will create the new glusterfs volume based on the system directory.

## Setting up the distributed GlusterFS volume

<Message type="note">
  For the server production, it is recommended to create the glusterfs volume using the different partition, not using a system directory.
</Message>

1. Create a new directory `/glusterfs/distributed` on both the gluster01 and the gluster02 servers.
    ```
    mkdir -p /glusterfs/distributed
    ```
2. Create a distributed glusterfs volume in the gluster01 server named `vol01` with two replicas: `gfs01` and `gfs02`. 
    ```
    gluster volume create vol01 transport tcp gluster01:/glusterfs/distributed gluster02:/glusterfs/distributed force
    ```
    ```
    volume create: vol01: success: please start the volume to access data
    ```
3. Start the `vol01` and check the volume info
    ```
    gluster volume start vol01
    gluster volume info vol01
    ```
    ```
    root@gluster01:/# gluster volume start vol01
    volume start: vol01: success
    root@gluster01:/# gluster volume info vol01

    Volume Name: vol01
    Type: Replicate
    Volume ID: 814b103e-522c-48d2-8d1c-3301e10f3416
    Status: Started
    Snapshot Count: 0
    Number of Bricks: 1 x 2 = 2
    Transport-type: tcp
    Bricks:
    Brick1: gluster01:/glusterfs/distributed
    Brick2: gluster02:/glusterfs/distributed
    Options Reconfigured:
    transport.address-family: inet
    nfs.disable: on
    performance.client-io-threads: off
    ```

At this stage, we created the `Replicate` type `vol01` volume and two bricks on the `gluster01` and `gluster02` servers. All data will be distributed automatically to each replica server.

## Configuring GlusterFS client

In this step, we will mount the `glusterfs` volume `vol01` to the Ubuntu client, and we need to install the glusterfs-client to the client server.

1. Install the glusterfs-client on `client01`.
    ```
    apt install glusterfs-client -y
    ```
2. Create a new directory: `/mnt/glusterfs`.
    ```
    mkdir -p /mnt/glusterfs
    ```
3. Mount the distributed glusterfs volume (`vol01`) to the `/mnt/glusterfs` directory.
    ```
    mount -t glusterfs gluster01:/vol01 /mnt/glusterfs
    ```
4. Check the amount of volume available in the system.
    ```
    df -h /mnt/glusterfs
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      To mount glusterfs permanently to the Ubuntu client system, we can add the volume to the `/etc/fstab`.
    </Message>
5. Edit the `/etc/fstab` configuration file: `vim /etc/fstab`.
6. Paste the following configuring:`gluster01:/vol01 /mnt/glusterfs glusterfs defaults,_netdev 0 0`.
7. Save and exit.
8. Reboot the server. When online, the glusterfs volume 'vol01' is mounted automatically through the fstab.

## Testing replication & mirroring

1. Mount the glusterfs volume `vol01` to each glusterfs servers.
    - On gluster01: `mount -t glusterfs gluster01:/vol01 /mnt`
    - On gluster02: `mount -t glusterfs gluster02:/vol01 /mnt`
2. Back on `client01`, go to the '/mnt/glusterfs' directory.
    ```
    cd /mnt/glusterfs
    ```
3. Create three files using the touch command.
    ```
    touch file01 file02 file03
    ```
4. Check on each `gluster01` and `gluster02` that the files that we created from the client machine are displayed.
    ```
    cd /mnt/
    ls -lah
    ```

    The gluster01 machine returns:

    ```
    root@gluster01:/mnt# ls -lah
    total 8.0K
    drwxr-xr-x  3 root root 4.0K Oct  1 15:40 .
    drwxr-xr-x 24 root root 4.0K Sep 28 14:11 ..
    -rw-r--r--  1 root root    0 Oct  1 15:40 file01
    -rw-r--r--  1 root root    0 Oct  1 15:40 file02
    -rw-r--r--  1 root root    0 Oct  1 15:40 file03
    ```

    The gluster02 machine returns:

    ```
    root@gluster02:/mnt# ls -lah
    total 8.0K
    drwxr-xr-x  3 root root 4.0K Oct  1 15:40 .
    drwxr-xr-x 24 root root 4.0K Sep 28 14:11 ..
    -rw-r--r--  1 root root    0 Oct  1 15:40 file01
    -rw-r--r--  1 root root    0 Oct  1 15:40 file02
    -rw-r--r--  1 root root    0 Oct  1 15:40 file03
    ```

As you can see, all the files we created from the client machine are distributed to all the glusterfs volume node servers.
