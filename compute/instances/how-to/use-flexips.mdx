This page shows you how to use [flexible IP addresses](/compute/instances/concepts#flexible-ip). When you create an Instance, it gets the following by default:
  - A [public IP address](/compute/instances/concepts#public-ip), which is also a flexible IP address.
  - A [private IP address](/network/vpc/concepts#private-ip-address)

You can hold flexible IP addresses independently of any Instance, and attach and detach  them to/from any of your Instances as you wish. You can keep a number of flexible IP addresses in your account at any given time. Flexible IP addresses allow you to do [live migration of IP addresses between your Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/how-to-migrate-from-from-one-instance-to-another/).

## How to detach a flexible IP address from an instance

Detaching your Instance's flexible (public) IP address cuts any ongoing public connection to the Instance. This feature gives you a lot of control if, for example, you want to put your Instances into a private network so that they can communicate between themselves without being exposed to the internet. This is particularly useful for Instances hosting databases, backups or sensitive content. It also allows you to optimize your costs and to fight the global IPv4 shortage.

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Instances page displays.

2. Click the Instance whose IP address you want to detach. The Overview page for that Instance displays.

3. Click **Detach** next to **Public IP**.

4. Click **Detach IP** on the pop-up that asks you to confirm the action.

  You can also detach a flexible IP by following step 1 above, then clicking on the **Flexible IPs** tab. From here, click <Icon name="more"/> next to the Instance in question, and select **Detach**.

## How to create a new flexible IP address

3. Click **Create a flexible IP** (or the <Icon name="plus" /> button if you have existing flexible IPs). The Flexible IP creation wizard displays.

4. Complete the following information in the wizard:
    - Choose an **Availability Zone**, which is the geographical region where your flexible IP will be created.
    - Optionally, select the **Instance** to which you want to attach this new flexible IP. You can only choose from Instances that do not already have a flexible IP attached to them.
    - Check the **Estimated Cost** for the flexible IP.

5. Click **Create a flexible IP** to finish.

You are taken to the list of your flexible IPs, where the new flexible IP address you just created now appears.

## How to attach an existing flexible IP address to an Instance

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Instances page displays.

2. Navigate to the **Flexible IPs** tab.

3. Click <Icon name="more"/> next to the flexible IP that you want to attach to an Instance. In the drop down-menu which opens, click **Select another instance**. 
  <Message type="note">

    This option will only be clickable if you have existing Instances which don't already have a flexible IP attached to them.

4. Confirm the Instance that you want to attach to this flexible IP in the pop-up window, and click **Attach this flexible IP**.

## How to delete a flexible IP address

When you no longer want one of your existing flexible IP addresses, you can delete it from your account, which releases it to be used by other users.

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Instances page displays.

2. Navigate to the **Flexible IPs** tab.

3. Click <Icon name="more"/> next to the flexible IP that you want to delete. In the drop down-menu which opens, click **Delete**. 

4. Confirm that you want to delete the flexible IP in the pop-up window which opens, by clicking **Delete this flexible IP**.

The flexible IP is deleted. If it was attached to an Instance, that Instance now has no public IP address.
