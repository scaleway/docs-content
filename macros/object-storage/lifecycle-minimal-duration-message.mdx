<Message type="important">
Transition rules created or updated after February 10, 2026 in the Warsaw region, and after February 18, 2026 in the Paris region, must observe the following minimal durations before applying:
  - Objects must be stored for at least 30 days before transitioning to Standard One Zone.
  - Objects must be stored for at least 90 days before transitioning to Glacier.

These minimal durations do not apply to lifecycle rules created before these dates, unless they are updated. The duration requirements above will then apply. They also do not apply to the Amsterdam region.
