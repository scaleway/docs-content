The **IBEX-Q1**, or the `QPU-IBEX-12PQ` platform on Scaleway, is AQT's general-purpose quantum processor.

| QPU Model | Qubits & Topology | Fidelity Metrics (Avg) | Speed Metrics | Pricing Model |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **QPU-IBEX-12PQ** IBEX-Q1 | 12 Qubits All-to-All | 1 gate: 99.97% 2-Gates: 98.7% | 5.5Hz | 0.31€/circuit + 0.021€/shot |

## Key Features
* **All-to-all Connectivity:** The ions are arranged in a linear chain but controlled by lasers that can entangle any pair. This massively reduces circuit depth for complex algorithms like QAOA or QML.
* **High fidelity:** Trapped ions offer some of the lowest error rates in the industry for 2-qubit gates.
* **Room temperature operation:** The system fits in standard rack cabinets and does not require the massive dilution refrigerators needed for superconducting qubits.

## Use cases
Thanks to its connectivity, the IBEX-Q1 QPU is particularly well suited for:
* **Combinatorial optimization:** Problems where variables are highly interdependent (Finance, Logistics).
* **Quantum simulation:** Simulating complex molecules where entanglement structure is dense.
* **Deep circuits:** Algorithms requiring long computation times before decoherence sets in.
