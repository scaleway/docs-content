Users were experiencing an issue on the console and the API where logs were not appearing. This bug is now fixed.

We also recommend you use the Serverless Functions dashboards in the [Scaleway Cockpit](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/observability/cockpit/quickstart/) to monitor all your metrics and logs and access advanced features (ordering, filtering...)
