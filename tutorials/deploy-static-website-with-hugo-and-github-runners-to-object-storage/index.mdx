Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in Go. The application is designed to take a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML website.
It uses Markdown files with front matter for metadata making it lightweight and easily to use. 

In this tutorial you learn how to install Hugo on your local computer so you can build your website locally, before pushing your content into a GitHub repository where a GitHub runner will take the content, generate the HTML version of it and uploads on a Object Storage bucket automatically.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have an Object Storage bucket with [bucket website feature](/storage/object/how-to/use-bucket-website) enabled
  - You have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and [created](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) an empty repository for your project
  - You have `git` installed on your local computer
</Message>

## Installing Hugo

Hugo is available for most operating systems. In this tutorial we describe the installation on a Unbuntu Linux system. For other operating systems, refer to the [official documentation](https://gohugo.io/installation/).

1. Open a terminal on your computer. 
2. Make sure your `apt` package manager is up to date:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   ```
3. Install Hugo using `apt`:
   ```
   sudo apt install hugo
   ```

## Creating a new site

Run the following commands to create a new site using Hugo. 

1. Create the site. In this example the site is named `mysuperwebsite`. You can give it a name of your choice. 
    ```
    hugo new site mysuperwebsite
    ```
2. Enter the website directory
    ```
    cd mysuperwebsite
    ```
3. Create a new page for your website:
    ```
    hugo new posts/hello-world.md
    ```
4. Open the newly created file in a text editor. The file is located in the `content/posts` directory.
    ```
    nano content/posts/hello-world.md
    ```
5. Edit the content as you wish. The file uses [markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/) for the body part and includes [front matter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/) to store metadata such as the title and the publication date.
    ```

    title: "Hello World"
    date: 2022-12-12T10:54:17+00:00
    ---
    ## Welcome to my super website

    This is **bold** text, and this is *emphasized* text.

    Do you prefer _underlined_? Markdown is great.
    ```
4. Configure your site by editing the file `config.toml` in the root directory of your project:
    ```
    # Set the base URL for your site here
    baseURL = 'http://mysuperwebsite.example.com/'
    languageCode = 'en-us'
    title = 'My super website'

    [deployment]

    [[deployment.targets]]
    # Configure the deployment target to the Object Storage bucket. Make sure your bucket is named exactly as your base URL (mysuperwebsite.example.com)
    name = "mysuperwebsite.example.com"
    URL = "s3://mysuperwebsite.example.com?endpoint=https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud&region=fr-par"
    ```
    <Message type="tip">
        The example above uses a bucket located in the region `fr-par`. If you bucket is located in another region edit the value to the corresponding region.
    </Message>
5. Run Hugo to generate your site for the first time
    ```
    hugo
    ```
5. Configure the remote upstream for your branch to your repository on GitHub: 
    ```
    git remote add origin https://github.com/mygithubaccount/mysuperwebsite.git
    ```
6. Set your local branch as `main` branch for the repository:
    ```
    git branch -M main
    ```
7. Push the content of your local repository to GitHub
    ```
    git push -u origin main
    ```

## Setting-up the GitHub runner

<Message type="tip">
    This step requires that you have created a [GitHub repoistory](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) for your project.
</Message>

1. Open a web browser and go to your projects' repoistory on [GitHub.com](http://github.com).
2. Click the **Settings** tab to display the settings of your repository. 
3. Click **Secrets** > **Actions** in the side menu. The list of Actions secrets displays. GitHub Secrets are encrypted data of sensitive information. They are used here to store the Scaleway secret key and access key.
4. Click **New repository secret** to create a new secret. Name it `SCW_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and enter your access key as secret value. Then click **Add secret** to save.
5. Repeat the step above with a secret named `SCW_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and your secret key as secret value.
6. Click the **Actions** tab. A list of suggested GitHub Actions for your project displays. Click **Skip this and setup a workflow yourself**.
7. Copy the follwing code in the text editor, keep the default file name `main.yml` and click **Start commit**:
    ```yaml
    name: Build and Deploy Hugo

    on:
      push:
        branches: [ "main" ]

    jobs:
      build_and_deploy:
        name: Deploy Hugo Website
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - name: setup hugo
          uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2.6.0
          with:
            hugo-version: '0.108.0'
        - name: build site
          run: hugo
        - name: deploy to s3
          run: hugo deploy --force --maxDeletes -1
          env:
            AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.SCW_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
            AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.SCW_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    ```
8. Enter a commit message, select **Commit directly to the `main` branch** and click **Commit new file**. 

The runner runs automatically for the first time and, builds and deploys your website to the Object Storage bucket.

## Adding more content

1. Create new pages using the `hugo new` command:
    ```
    hugo new posts/my-second-blogpost.md
    ```
2. Edit the file using a text editor and save it
    ```
    nano content/posts/my-second-blogpost.md
    ```
3. Add the newly created file to your repository:
    ```
    git add .
    ```
4. Commit the changes you made
    ```
    git commit -c "added a new blogpost"
    ```
5. Push your content to the remote repository:
    ```
    git push origin main
    ```

GitHub Actions launches automatically the script created in the previous script and a runner will execute Hugo, build the website and deploy it to Object Storage. You can see your updated website a few moments later in your webbrowser.
