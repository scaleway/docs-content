This page shows you how to send [metrics](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#metric) and [logs](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#logs) to your [Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#cockpit).

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
  - You have [activated your Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/how-to/activate-cockpit/)
</Message>

1. Click **Cockpit** in the Observability section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Cockpit** overview page displays.
2. [Create a token](/observability/cockpit/how-to/create-token).
3. Check **Metrics** and **Logs** for the **Push** permission when selecting your token permissions, so your token can write logs and metrics.

    <Message type="important">
     Once you have created your token, your secret key displays only once. Make sure you copy and save it before you exit the page.
    </Message>
4. Configure your applications to send metrics and logs to your Cockpit [endpoints](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#endpoints), using your newly-created token for authentication.
    ```
    "metrics_url": "https://metrics.prd.obs.fr-par.scw.cloud",
    "logs_url": "https://logs.prd.obs.fr-par.scw.cloud",
    "grafana_url": "https://grafanaprodp6pn95xf-grafanaabcdef1234.functions.fnc.fr-par.scw.cloud"
    ```
    <Message type="important">
     You must use the endpoints into your agents to be able to export your data.
    </Message>

5. [Log in to your Grafana account](/observability/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards).
6. Create your [Grafana dashboard](/observability/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards) and start monitoring your data.
