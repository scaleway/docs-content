**Flexible IPv6 are now available!**

You can request a /64 for free and assign it to any of your Elastic Metal servers!

**For security reasons, SMTP ports are now blocked by default on new Elastic Metal servers delivered.**

You can [enable them](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/elastic-metal/how-to/enable-smtp/) in the Elastic Metal console (through general settings) when your [identity is validated](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/console/my-account/how-to/verify-identity).

**Our brand-new Elastic Metal EM-A210R-HDD is now available!**

These new dedicated servers are powered with the AMD Ryzenâ„¢ 5 PRO 3600 processor (6C/12T &#8211; 3.6GHz), 2 x 1 TB HDD, 16 GB RAM and 1 Gbit/s.
