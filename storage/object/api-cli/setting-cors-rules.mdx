The [CORS standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) describes new HTTP headers which provide browsers a way to request remote URLs only when they have permission. Although some validation and authorization can be performed by the server, it is generally the browser's responsibility to support these headers and honor the restrictions they impose.

Before CORS became standardized it was not possible to call an API endpoint or other content under different domains for security reasons. This was (and to some degree still is) blocked by the Same-Origin Policy introduced with Netscape Navigator 2.0 in 1995.

An example of a cross-origin request: The frontend JavaScript code for a web application served from `http://webapplication.com` uses `XMLHttpRequest` to make a request for `http://customerapi.io/data.json`. Another example might be JavaScript that calls files in an Object Storage bucket, like web fonts, downloads etc. It is possible to configure CORS for each bucket with [`aws-cli`](/storage/object/api-cli/object-storage-aws-cli/).

## Setting CORS on an Object Storage bucket

1. Enter the **Object Storage** section in the left menu of the console.
2. Create a [new bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket) or choose one of your existing buckets.
3. The CORS configuration should be provided in a json file. Create a new file called `cors.json` locally, open it in a text editor and copy the following content into the file before saving it.
    ```
    {
      "CORSRules": [
        {
          "AllowedOrigins": ["http://MY_DOMAIN_NAME", "http://www.MY_DOMAIN_NAME"],
          "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
          "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"],
          "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000,
          "ExposeHeaders": ["Etag"]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      Replace `http://MY_DOMAIN_NAME` with the domain name to authorize for CORS. You can specify multiple domain names, or put an asterisk (`*`) to allow all domains.
    </Message>
4. Set the CORS configuration of the bucket with AWS CLI:
    ```
    aws s3api put-bucket-cors --bucket BUCKETNAME --cors-configuration file://cors.json
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      Replace `BUCKETNAME` with the name of the bucket.
    </Message>


## Getting the CORS configuration of a bucket


To retrieve the CORS rules of a bucket, use `aws-cli`:
```
aws s3api get-bucket-cors --bucket BUCKETNAME
```

If CORS rules are set for the bucket, the API returns a JSON list like this example:
```json
{
  "CORSRules": [
      {
          "AllowedHeaders": [
              "*"
          ],
          "AllowedMethods": [
              "GET",
              "HEAD",
              "POST",
              "PUT",
              "DELETE"
          ],
          "AllowedOrigins": [
              "http://MY_DOMAIN_NAME",
              "http://www.MY_DOMAIN_NAME"
          ],
          "ExposeHeaders": [
              "Etag"
          ],
          "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
      }
  ]
}
```

If there are no CORS rules set for the bucket, an error message appears:
```
An error occurred (NoSuchCORSConfiguration) when calling the GetBucketCors operation: The CORS configuration does not exist
```
## Verifying the CORS configuration of a bucket

To verify the CORS rules of a bucket, curl can be used with the different methods (`GET`, `POST`, ...)  

For example:

```
curl -X OPTIONS -H 'Origin: http://MY_DOMAIN_NAME' http://BUCKETNAME.s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud/index.html -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET"
```

## Deleting the CORS configuration of a bucket

To delete the CORS rules of a bucket, use `aws-cli`:
```
aws s3api delete-bucket-cors --bucket BUCKETNAME
```

<Message type="note">
  If the operation is successful, no output returns.
</Message>
