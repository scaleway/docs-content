- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Added a valid payment method](/billing/how-to/add-payment-method/) to your Scaleway account

  We highly recommend using our name servers for a seamless migration experience:
    - `ns1.whm.fr-par.scw.cloud.`
    - `ns2.whm.fr-par.scw.cloud.`
  If you are managing your DNS zone yourself, you can locate all the necessary DNS pointers for configuration within the **DNS verification** tab of your Web Hosting in the Scaleway console.

  - Migrating your Web Hosting plan **is a definitive decision**. Once completed, it is not possible to revert back to your previous plan.
  - You must ensure that a [valid payment method has been added](/billing/how-to/add-payment-method/) to your Scaleway account before initiating the migration. This is a **mandatory** step to prevent any possible interruption or locking of your web hosting plan during the migration.

1. Go to the [list of web hosting accounts](https://console.online.net/en/mut/list) and select the web hosting you want to migrate.
2. Click **Migrate** on the web hosting overview. A pop-up appears.
3. Review the details related to your web hosting and click **Migrate** to automatically populate the migration information in the Scaleway console. You are redirected to the Scaleway console, where the migration details for your web hosting should display.
4. Make sure that you are within the [destination Project](/organizations-and-projects/quickstart/) for your hosting. Then, click **Migrate your Web Hosting**.

      You also have the option to initiate the migration process manually by copying and pasting the web hosting details from your Dedibox console into the [Scaleway Web Hosting migration form](https://console.scaleway.com/webhosting/webhostings/migrate).
