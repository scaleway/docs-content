## Alias

An email alias is an additional email address for an email account, with which a user can send and receive emails, or set forwards to. A single user account can have multiple email aliases, with different domains or even with the same domain.

## cPanel

cPanel is a web hosting control panel that simplifies the management of websites. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface, allowing users to perform tasks such as creating email accounts, managing files, and installing applications. cPanel is widely used by website owners to streamline the administration of their web hosting services.

## Dedicated IP

Dedicated IP is a paid option that allows you to have a unique IP, separate from the shared default IP, for each hosting.

Opting for a dedicated IP is ideal if you intend to send emails and protect your IP reputation. This ensures that you will not be affected by the negative reputation other clients sharing the same IP may have.
Upon activation, we automatically assign your hosting a dedicated IP after verifying it is not blacklisted. Deactivating the option triggers a similar check. If the IP is clean, it will automatically be removed from your account. Otherwise, [contact our Support team](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elementssupport/tickets) to address any issues.

## Email account

An email account is an email address on which mail is stored (unlike an alias / catchall). You can check your email accounts via two protocols: POP3 and IMAP.

## FTP account

FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, is a protocol that allows you to transfer files between different computers over the internet. It allows you, as part of your Web Hosting plan, to transfer your files from your computer to Scaleway.com - e.g. to update your website. It also works the other way around: you can recover the files stored on Scaleway.com and transfer them to your personal computer, e.g. to make a backup.

## Filtering

Filtering allows you to sort your emails depending on different criteria (the sender, the subject, the object and much more). If the email meets one or more criteria you can define different actions (delete the email, move it into a folder, etc).

## htaccess

`.htaccess` is a simple text file containing commands for the configuration of the Apache web server. It allows you to personalize the server dynamically and per folder. The configuration values are inherited through directories. Common applications for setting up a `.htaccess` file are switching between PHP4 and PHP5, protection of a part of the site, redirecting a website to another, or customizing error messages. Once on the server, its name must be `.htaccess`, starting with a dot.

## Hosting dashboard

Your hosting dashboard is the admin interface (cPanel or WordPress) where you can manage your website's content and settings.

## PHP

PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. While PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, it now stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, which is a recursive backronym.

## php.ini

The `php.ini` file is the configuration file used for applications that require PHP. It contains variable configurations such as upload size, file timeout, and resource limits. For Scaleway Web Hosting, we provide PHP with the most common values preconfigured. If required, you can [customize the configuration of PHP](/classic-hosting/how-to/configure-php/) to suit your needs.

## Protected hosting

Protected hosting is a feature that prevents your Web Hosting plan from being deleted, ensuring your site stays online. While deletion is blocked, you can still manage and configure your hosting settings through the control panel ([cPanel](#cpanel)). This protection keeps your hosting secure without limiting your ability to make necessary adjustments.
