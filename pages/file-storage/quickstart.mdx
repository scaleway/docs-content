Scaleway File Storage allows you to create file systems to easily share files across multiple Instances within the same region. File systems are network-attached storage structures that can be accessed by Scaleway Instances to easily share files within your cloud infrastructure.

Each file system can be attached to several Instances, and each Instance can have several file systems attached to it.

This guide teaches you how to quickly create, attach, mount, unmount, detach, and delete a file system using the Scaleway console.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to create a file system

1. Click **File Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The [File Storage dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/file-storage/) displays.

2. Click **+ Create file system**. The [file system creation page](https://console.scaleway.com//file-storage/file-storage/create) displays.

3. Complete the following steps:
    - Select the region in which your file system will be created. It will be accessible by [Instances](/instances/) within the same [region](/file-storage/concepts/#region).
    - Enter a name for your file system, or use the automatically generated one. The name of your file system can only contain alphanumeric characters, spaces, and dashes.
    - Configure the provisioned size of your file system.
        <Message type="note">
        File systems are billed based on the provisioned space, and not on actual usage.
        </Message>

    - Resize your file system
    - Attach your file system to one or several Instance(s)
    - Retrieve the command to mount your file system on your Instance(s)
    - Delete your file system

## How to attach a file system to one or more Instance(s)

<Message type="note">
To attach a file system to an Instance, you must have [created at least one POP2 Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) beforehand. File systems can only be attached to POP2 Instances.
</Message>

1. Click **File Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. A list of your file systems displays.

2. Click the name of the file system you want to attach. The **Overview** page displays.

3. Open the **Attached Instance(s)** tab. A list of currently attached Instances displays.

4. Click **Attach an Instance**. A pop-up displays.

5. Select one Instance or more from the drop-down list, then click **Attach** to confirm.

    <Message type="important">
    File systems can only be attached to POP2 Instances within the same [region](/file-storage/concepts/#region).
    </Message>

Your file system is now attached to the selected Instance(s) and can now be [mounted](/file-storage/how-to/mount-file-system/) to a Scaleway Instance.

## How to mount a file system to a Scaleway Instance

<Message type="note">
To mount a file system to an Instance, you must have [attached your file system to an Instance](#how-to-attach-a-file-system-to-one-or-more-instance-s) beforehand. File systems can only be attached to POP2 Instances.
</Message>

1. Click **File Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. A list of your file systems displays.

2. Click the name of the file system you want to mount. The **Overview** page displays.

3. From the **Mount** section of the **Overview** page, copy the mounting command:

    ```sh
    mount -t virtiofs <file_system_id> /mnt
    ```

4. Open a terminal and [connect via SSH to the Instances](/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/) you previously [attached to your file system](/file-storage/how-to/attach-file-system/).

5. Run the previously copied mount command to mount your file system at the specified mount point (`/mnt` by default):

    ```sh
    mount -t virtiofs <file_system_id> /mnt
    ```

    <Message type="note">
    You can specify a different mount point by replacing `/mnt` by the desired directory.
    </Message>

6. Run the following command to display the file systems of your Instance:

    ```sh
    df -h
    ```

    A list of your file systems displays, containing the one you just mounted:

    ```sh
    Filesystem                            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    tmpfs                                 794M  992K  793M   1% /run
    /dev/sda1                             8.0G  2.1G  6.0G  26% /
    /dev/sda2                             881M   61M  758M   8% /boot
    2933ea63-example-file-system-c05fe2    94G     0   94G   0% /mnt

Your file system is now mounted and accessible from the specified mount point in your Instance.

## How to unmount a file system from a Scaleway Instance

5. Run the following command. Make sure to replace the placeholder and mount point with the appropriate values:

    ```sh
    unmount <file_system_id> /mnt
    ```

Your file system is now unmounted from the specified Instance.

## How to detach a file system from an instance
