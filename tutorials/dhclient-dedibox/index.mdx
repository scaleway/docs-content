  It is now recommended to use the systemd-networkd DHCP client as the one provided by the Internet Systems Consortium, [dhclient](https://github.com/isc-projects/dhcp), has reached its End of Life (EOL) on 5th October 2022.

  On servers supporting [IPv6 SLAAC](/dedibox-network/ipv6/how-to/enable-ipv6-slaac), SLAAC has to be enabled in order to ensure that DHCPv6 works correctly. If disabled, a server will not be able to learn its IPv6 default route.

## How to set the DUID of your subnet

1. Log into your server using SSH.
2. Open the file `/etc/dhcp/dhclient6.conf` in a text editor, for example: `nano`, and edit it as shown below:
    ```
    interface "eno1" {
        send dhcp6.client-id DUID;
    }
    ```

    Make sure to adapt the interface name (`eno1`) to the Internet interface name of your system and replace `DUID` with the DUID of your prefix.

## How to autostart the DHCPv6 client during system boot

To enable automatic start of the DHCPv6 client during system boot, a systemd service is required.

1. Log into your server using SSH.
2. Open the file `/etc/systemd/system/dhclient.service` in a text editor, for example: `nano`, and edit it as shown below:
    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=dhclient for sending DUID IPv6
    After=network-online.target
    Wants=network-online.target

    [Service]
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=10
    Type=forking
    ExecStart=/sbin/dhclient -cf /etc/dhcp/dhclient6.conf -6 -P -v eno1
    ExecStop=/sbin/dhclient -x -pf /var/run/dhclient6.pid

    [Install]
    WantedBy=network.target
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      The path to the `dhclient` binary may vary depending on your OS. To see the exact path for your system, use the following command: `which dhclient`.

3. Enable the service so it will start automatically at each reboot of the machine:
    ```
    sudo systemctl enable dhclient.service
    ```
