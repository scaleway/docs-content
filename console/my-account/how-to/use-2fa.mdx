You can enable multifactor authentication on your Scaleway account for heightened security. Once enabled, an additional security, code generated by your phone, is required to access your account.

Multifactor authentication provides extra layers of security. As well as your password (the first factor), other factors (such as a MFA app) are required to gain access to your account. Even in case of leaked password, your account is protected.

## How to download an MFA app

To use multifactor authentication on your account, you first need to download an MFA app onto your smartphone. Once configured, MFA apps display a constantly rotating set of codes to use with your different accounts when you are prompted for one at log in. Popular MFA apps include:
- [Authy](https://authy.com/download/)
- [FreeOTP](https://freeotp.github.io/)
- [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en&gl=US)

Download the app of your choice and install it onto your smartphone.

## How to enable MFA

1. Click to open the Organization drop-down menu in the top-right corner of the console, and select **My Profile**.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-org-dropdown-myprofile.webp" alt="" />
2. Scroll to the bottom of your profile page, and click **Enable MFA**. A pop-up displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-2FA-popup-1.webp" alt="" />
3. Enter the code shown on the pop-up into your MFA app, or alternatively, scan the QR code into your app.
    Your app sets up MFA for your Scaleway account, and displays a 6-digit code.
4. Enter the 6-digit code given by your app into the pop-up box, and click **Submit**. A pop-up displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-2FA-popup-2.webp" alt="" />
5. Download or copy the backup codes shown, and save them in a safe place. These codes will be the only way you can regain access to your account without your MFA app. 

MFA is now enabled. Next time you log in to your Scaleway account, you will be prompted for a MFA code. Use your MFA app to get the code and enter it into the Scaleway console.

## How to disable MFA

1. Click to open the Organization drop-down menu in the top-right corner of the console, and select **My Profile**.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page, and click **Disable 2FA**. A pop-up displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-2FA-disable.webp" alt="" />
3. Type **DISABLE** in the box to confirm, and click **Disable**

## How to regain access to your account

### If you lose your MFA device

If you lose your MFA device, you can use the backup codes that were generated when you activated MFA to regain access.

When you log into your account, you are prompted for a MFA code:

<Lightbox src="scaleway-2FA-login.webp" alt="" />

Enter one of your backup codes (instead of a code generated by your MFA device in real-time) and click **Send token**. You are logged into your account, and can disable MFA if you wish by [following the instructions above](#how-to-disable-MFA).

### If you lose your MFA device and your backup codes

If you lose both your MFA device and your backup codes, it is more difficult to regain access to your account. You will need to go through a manual identity verification process.

The only way to regain access to your account is to contact our support team with the following information:
  * Email address
  * Postal address
  * Two different documents proving your identity (passport or local ID card for individual accounts + certificate of incorporation for companies)
  * A contact phone number
  * A copy of your last Scaleway invoice, or details about the amount charged if you do not have a copy
  * A card or bank statement showing your Scaleway invoice debit

Once you have collected all this information, send it to [document@scaleway.com](mailto:document@scaleway.com).
