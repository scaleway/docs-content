The Serverless Jobs `v1alpha2` API introduces a new startup execution mechanism based on [commands and arguments](/serverless-jobs/concepts/#startup-commands-and-arguments), replacing the legacy `command`.

The Scaleway console allows you to quickly and easily migrate your existing jobs to the new system.

Migration from `command` field to `startup_command` field is mostly transparent for customers using Scaleway Console but can require some attention of API, CLI and other devtools users.

The change allows for:
- More customization for executing complex commands, by separating `startup_command` and `args`.
- Better alignment with our underlying [Kubernetes implementation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/).
- The ability to compute environment variables used in command and argument strings.
- `startup_command` is now an array of commands instead of a single string.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An existing job that uses the legacy command field

## How to migrate from command to startup commands and arguments

1. Click **Jobs** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The jobs page displays.

2. Click the name of the job you want to manage, then click the **Settings** tab.

3. Scroll down to the **Configure advanced options**, then click the **Execution** tab.

4. Click the **Upgrade** button. A pop-up displays.

5. Split your existing startup command into a command (which corresponds to the `ENTRYPOINT` Docker instruction), and arguments (which correspond to the `CMD` Docker instruction).

6. Click **Upgrade to the new format** to finish.

Your Serverless Job now uses the command and arguments mechanism.

## Migration examples

### Simple command

**Legacy command**

```bash
sleep 60s
```

**Corresponding command and arguments**

```yaml
startup_command: [sleep]
args: [60s]
```

### Complex command

**Legacy command**

```bash
/app/migrate up --database "$DB_URL" --password "$DB_PASSWORD" --port 3002
```

**Corresponding command and arguments**

```yaml
startup_command: [/app/migrate]
args: [up, --database, "$(DB_URL)", --password, "$(DB_PASSWORD)", --port, 3002]
```
