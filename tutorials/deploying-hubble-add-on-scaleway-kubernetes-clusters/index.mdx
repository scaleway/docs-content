Hubble is a network observability and security monitoring tool for Cilium. This guide covers two methods to deploy Hubble on a Scaleway Kubernetes cluster:

- [Using the Scaleway Console (Easy Deploy)](#deploying-via-scaleway-console-easy-deploy)
- [Using the Scaleway CLI with Helm](#deploying-via-cli-with-helm)

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [Scaleway Kubernetes cluster](/kubernetes/) (v1.31.0 or higher) with **Cilium CNI enabled**.
- `kubectl` and `helm` installed and configured on your local machine to interact with your Scaleway Kubernetes cluster.

## Deploying via Scaleway console (Easy Deploy)

You can deploy Hubble using Scaleway's Easy Deploy feature directly from the [console](https://console.scaleway.com), which simplifies the deployment process.

1. Navigate to the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) and go to: **Containers \> Kubernetes \> Your Cluster \> Applications**.
2. Click **Create** and select **Application Library**.
3. Search for **Cilium Hubble** and select it.
4. Review the default configuration and modify it if needed (see configuration options below).
5. Enter an **application name** and **namespace** (use `kube-system` as required).
6. Click **Deploy Application** to start the deployment.
7. Once deployed, restart Cilium agents and check roll out status as follows:
    ```
    kubectl -n kube-system rollout restart daemonset cilium
    ```
    Then,
    ```
    kubectl -n kube-system rollout status daemonset cilium
    ```

### Accessing Hubble UI

1. Once deployed, forward the Hubble UI service to your local machine:
    ```
    kubectl -n kube-system port-forward svc/hubble-ui 12000:80
    ```

2. Open a browser and go to:
    ```
    http://localhost:12000
    ```

## Deploying via CLI with Helm

Alternatively, you can deploy Hubble using the CLI with Helm, which offers a more customizable and fine-grained deployment experience.
This method is ideal for users who require advanced configuration options and control over the deployment process.

1. Add the Scaleway Helm repository and update it:
    ```
    helm repo add scaleway https://helm.scw.cloud/
    helm repo update
    ```
2. Deploy Hubble in the `kube-system` namespace:
    ```
    helm -n kube-system upgrade --install scaleway-cilium-hubble scaleway/scaleway-cilium-hubble
    ```
3. Restart Cilium agents to apply the configuration:
    ```
    kubectl -n kube-system rollout restart daemonset cilium
    ```
4. Check rollout status:
    ```
    kubectl -n kube-system rollout status daemonset cilium
    ```

### Accessing Hubble UI

1. Forward the Hubble UI service to your local machine once the application is deployed:
    ```
    kubectl -n kube-system port-forward svc/hubble-ui 12000:80
    ```
2. Open a browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://localhost:12000
    ```

## Configuration options

Hubble can be customized using Helm values. Example key parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Default Value |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `nodeConfig.hubble-event-buffer-capacity` | Capacity of the buffer to store recent events.  | `32767` |
| `nodeConfig.hubble-metrics` | A space-separated list of metrics to enable.  | see `values.yaml` for the default list |
| `nodeConfig.hubble-metrics-server` | Address to expose Hubble metrics | `:9965` |
| `nodeConfig.enable-hubble-open-metrics` | Enable OpenMetrics | `false` |
| `nodeConfig.enable-hubble` | Enable Hubble gRPC service | `true` |
| `nodeConfig.hubble-socket-path` | UNIX domain socket for Hubble server | `/var/run/cilium/hubble.sock` |

For additional options, refer to the [Helm charts documentation](https://github.com/scaleway/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/scaleway-cilium-hubble).

<Message type="note">
    * Hubble **must** be deployed in the `kube-system` namespace.
    * Do **not** enable `operator/envoy/agent` as it may break the managed Cilium.
    * Costs may arise based on usage.
