## What is Cockpit?

Cockpit is a monitoring and alerting solution designed for multi-source observability. Cockpit allows you to collect, store, and analyze metrics and logs from your infrastructure and applications, giving you insights into your system's performance and behavior.
Cockpits are scoped per [Project](/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project).

## How does Cockpit integrate with other Scaleway products?

Cockpit integrates seamlessly with Scaleway’s ecosystem. It provides pre-built dashboards in Grafana, and alerts to monitor other Scaleway resources' performance.

Refer to the [dedicated documentation page](/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-limitations/#product-integration-into-cockpit) for the whole list of Scaleway resources integrated with Cockpit.

## What is the difference between Scaleway and custom data?

[Scaleway data](#scaleway-data) is collected automatically from Scaleway products, while [custom data](#custom-data) is manually pushed from your own sources.

### Scaleway data

Scaleway data is the observability data (metrics and/or logs) that is natively collected by all [Scaleway products integrated with Cockpit](/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-limitations/#product-integration-into-cockpit).

### Custom data

Custom data refers to any metrics, logs, or traces that you manually push to Cockpit. This can include data from applications hosted at Scaleway or any other platform.

## How am I billed for using Cockpit with my Scaleway data?

Scaleway data is collected and available in Cockpit for free. Retention is also free as long as it stays within the default period: 31 days for metrics and 7 days for logs.

You can [adjust the retention period](/cockpit/how-to/change-data-retention) from 1 day (for logs) or 31 days (for metrics) to 1 year. Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/cockpit/concepts/#retention) for more information on available retention periods. However, starting May 1, 2025, data stored beyond the default period will incur charges based on daily storage volume.

## How am I billed for using Cockpit with custom data?

Sending custom data to Cockpit such as data from non-integrated Scaleway resources or external sources incurs additional costs.

Retention of custom data is free within the default period: 31 days for custom metrics and 7 days for custom logs and traces. You can [adjust the retention period](/cockpit/how-to/change-data-retention) from 1 day (for logs and traces) and 31 days (for metrics) to 1 year. However, starting May 1, 2025, data stored beyond the default period will be charged based on daily storage volume.

Querying custom data is always free.

Ingestion for custom data is billed as follows:

- Custom metrics are billed €0.15 per million samples of metrics ingested
- Custom logs are billed €0.35 per GB ingested
- Custom traces are billed €0.35 per GB ingested

Scaleway applies volume discounts to bill custom metrics. This means that the monthly pricing for custom metrics will be calculated in levels. **Scaleway applies six levels of volume discounts.**

| Levels       | Range                                        | Monthly pricing with volume discounts    |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Level one    | From 0 to 10 billion custom metrics          | €0.15 per million samples                |
| Level two    | From 10 to 25 billion custom metrics         | €0.13 per million samples                |
| Level three  | From 25 to 50 billion custom metrics         | €0.12 per million samples                |
| Level four   | From 50 to 100 billion custom metrics        | €0.11 per million samples                |
| Level five   | From 100 to 200 billion custom metrics       | €0.10 per million samples                |
| Level six    | From 200 billion custom metrics and beyond   | €0.08 per million samples                |


Here is an example of how you would be billed for **sending 52 billion custom metrics samples per month**:

- 10 billion samples at €0.15 per million samples: €1.500
- 15 billion samples at €0.13 per million samples: €1.950
- 25 billion samples at €0.12 per million samples: €3.000
- 2 billion samples at €0.11 per million samples: €220

**Total:** €6.650 per month with volume discounts instead of €7.800 without volume discounts.

## How am I billed for increasing data retention period?

All ingested data, whether from Scaleway or custom sources, is retained for free within the default periods:
- **Metrics:** 31 days
- **Logs and traces:** 7 days

**Starting May 1, 2025, data retained beyond these periods will be charged** based on daily storage volume:

- **Metrics:** €0.0002 per 10 million samples/day
- **Logs and traces:** €0.002 per GB/day

If you delete your data source or reduce its retention period below the default value, data will be deleted and you will no longer be charged for extended retention.

<Concept>
  ## See custom retention pricing examples
  ### For 10 days of retention
  If you ingest an average of **2GB of logs daily** and increase retention to **10 days**. Retention is free for the first **7 days**, so you are only charged for the extra **3 days**:

  **Monthly estimated cost:**
    `retention_cost` = 2 GB x (10 - 7) x 0.002€ x 30 days = 0.36€/month

  ### For 90 days of retention
  If you extend retention to **90 days**, you are charged for the extra **83 days** beyond the free period:
  **Monthly estimated cost:**
   `retention_cost` = 2 GB x (90 - 7) x 0.002€ x 30 days = 9.96€/month
</Concept>

## Why are Cockpit pricing plans being deprecated?

From January 1st 2025, Cockpit is transitioning away from fixed pricing plans to offer you more flexibility and granularity for managing data [retention](/cockpit/concepts/#retention).

This change allows you to tailor retention settings to your specific needs. We hope to enhance your experience by providing more customizable options without immediate cost impact, as changing data retention period will be free during Beta.

Find out [how to change data retention period](/cockpit/how-to/change-data-retention/) in the dedicated documentation.

## How do I send my own data to my Cockpit?

If you have set up an agent, you can send your data using our [dedicated documentation](/cockpit/how-to/send-metrics-logs-to-cockpit/).


If you have not set up an agent, check out our [documentation](/cockpit/how-to/send-metrics-with-grafana-alloy/) to find out how to
configure the Grafana Alloy agent, push your data, and visualize it in Grafana.

## Which Scaleway products are integrated into Cockpit?

Find out which Scaleway products are integrated into Cockpit in our [capabilities and limits documentation page](/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-limitations/#product-integration-into-cockpit).

Refer to our [documentation on understanding Cockpit usage and pricing](/cockpit/reference-content/understanding-cockpit-usage/) for more information on how to reduce extra costs.

<Message type="important">
 Sending metrics and logs for Scaleway resources or personal data using an external path is a billable feature. In addition, any data that you push yourself is billed, even if you send data from Scaleway products. Refer to the [product pricing](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/?tags=available,managedservices-observability-cockpit) for more information.

## Will my dashboards be impacted by the Cockpit regionalization?

Soon, a new version of Cockpit will be released. In this version, the concept of **regionalization** will be introduced to offer you more flexibility and resilience for seamless monitoring.

If you have created customized dashboards with data for your Scaleway resources before April 2024, you will need to update your queries in Grafana, with the new regionalized data sources.
