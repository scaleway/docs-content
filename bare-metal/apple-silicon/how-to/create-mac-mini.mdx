  Due to license constraints, the minimum lease for Apple silicon is 24 hours. As a result, a Mac mini can only be deleted after 24 hours have passed from when you initiated the lease.

1. Click **Apple silicon** in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu. The Apple silicon creation page displays.     
    <Message type="note">
      Should your account already contain Mac minis, a list of these will be displayed rather than the new creation interface.  
      Alongside, you will find the "plus" icon (<Icon name="plus" />) which allows you to create a new Mac mini.

2. Click **Create Mac mini**. The Mac mini creation wizard displays.
3. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 
    - Choose an **Availability Zone**, which is the geographical region where your Mac mini will be deployed.
    - Select the **Hardware configuration** for your Mac mini. 
    - Enter a **Name** for your Mac mini, or leave the randomly-generated name in place. 
    - Verify the **Estimated cost** for your Mac mini, based on the specifications you chose.
4. Click **Create a Mac mini** to finish. The installation of your Apple silicon is launched, and you are informed when it is ready.
