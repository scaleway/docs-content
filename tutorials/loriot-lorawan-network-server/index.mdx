## LoRaWAN© and Loriot Overview

LoRaWAN© is a low-power, low-bandwidth, long-range radio protocol used by many devices to send their data over the air. This protocol is specifically designed for battery powered devices with little to no installation cost.

LoRaWAN© devices broadcast their data to reachable LoRaWAN© gateways, which forward the messages on the LoRaWAN© operator network. The operator de-duplicates the messages from multiple gateways and hand over the message to the "LoRaWAN© application". In our scenario, the "LoRaWAN© application" is Scaleway IoT Hub.

[Loriot](https://loriot.io) is a LoRaWAN© network server provider on which to connect your LoRaWAN© gateways and build your private LoRaWAN© network.

In this tutorial we are going to:

- Create a IoT Hub to receive/send messages from/to LoRaWAN© devices
- Add a Device to the Hub to prepare the Loriot-to-Scaleway connection
- Set up the Loriot backend to use the Device credentials to establish a connection with IoT Hub
- Add another Device and connect it as a subscriber to receive LoRaWAN© messages

## Create an IoT Hub

First, we need to create a Hub. Its role will be to distribute messages from your LoRaWAN© devices to the intended targets. Please follow [this procedure](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/create-hub/) to create an IoT Hub if you don't have one already. The hub's name and plan does not matter for this tutorial.

## Create an IoT Device

The Loriot platform will connect as a MQTT device to exchange data on IoT Hub. This means that we need to add a Device to the IoT Hub. Please follow [this procedure](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/add-device/) to create a device.

<Message type="note">

- Use the `Allow Insecure` connections setting.
- The device name is not important for this tutorial.

</Message>

Once done, copy the `Device ID`, you will need them to set up the Loriot backend.

## Set up the Loriot backend

Now IoT Hub is ready to exchange messages, let's configure the Loriot side:

- Go to your Loriot Dashboard
- Click `Applications` and select your application in the list
- Click `Output` in the left pane, click `Add a new output` and choose `MQTT`
- Fill in the following parameters:
  - MQTT Broker URL: your IoT Hub Endpoint, followed by MQTTs port (ex: `iot.fr-par.scw.cloud`)
  - MQTT Path: the MQTT topic to publish messages to, set it to `my-app/{DEVEUI}/uplink`.
  - Username: you can't leave this field empty, so just write `x` here, it won't be used
  - Password: you can't leave this field empty, so just write `x` here, it won't be used
  - Client ID: your IoT Hub Device ID
- That's it, click `Add Output` button

Please note that there is an additional step to be performed if you are using a Loriot private network server. You should get in touch with your Loriot representative for this.

## Verify we have done things right

It is time to see messages flowing on IoT Hub:

- Create another IoT Hub Device, but this time choose the `Allow Insecure` connections setting. Secured connections are not supported over Web Sockets, which the `MQTT Webclient` uses.
- On the Device page, click the `MQTT Webclient` button. The client will open and automatically connect.

- Now subscribe to the LoRaWAN© devices messages:
  - Click `Add New Topic Subscription` in the `Subscriptions` block
  - Pick any color to identify this subscription
  - Leave QoS 0
  - Use `my-app/+/uplink` as the topic, this will instruct IoT Hub to send you uplink messages from all devices
  - Click subscribe

- Your subscription now appears in the `Subscriptions` block and the messages from your LoRaWAN© devices will start showing in the `Messages` block.

Congratulations! Messages are flowing as expected.

## Going further

You could leverage the power of IoT Hub to build a dashboard to display your data in a few easy steps:

- [Start a PostgreSQL managed DB instance](/storage/database/how-to/create-a-database/) and create a `lora` table with the following fields: `time` (timestamp type) and `data` (jsonb type)
- Configure a Database Route to push data in there, [see how to](/storage/database/how-to/create-a-database/). The topic filter should be `my-app/things/+/uplink`. Your query should look like `INSERT INTO lora (time, data) VALUES (NOW(), $PAYLOAD)`.
- Start a [new Scaleway instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance) and setup Grafana, get inspiration from [this tutorial](/tutorials/visualize-timeseries-data-timescaledb-grafana) (steps 1 to 14, don't enable TimescaleDB option).
- Add widgets to your dashboard, for a graph your query could look like `SELECT time, data->'DevEUI_uplink'->'payload'->'batteryLevel' as batteryLevel FROM lora WHERE $__timeFilter(time)`.

That's it! Your LoRaWAN© devices data is now backed by a production-grade dashboard!
