## OS images

An OS image for Instances refers to a pre-configured operating system installation that you can select when creating an Instance on the Scaleway cloud platform. We offer a variety of OS images that cater to different needs and preferences.
Scaleway manages the deployment and maintenance of these OS images, ensuring they are up-to-date and secure.
