Scaleway Container Registry supports image versioning. This allows you to track any changes in your container image versions, and easily revert your deployment if needed. You can choose which image version you want to pull, and delete any versions that you no longer need.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner/) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission/) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [Container Registry namespace](/containers/container-registry/how-to/create-namespace/)


1. Click **Container Registry** in the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The Container Registry namespaces dashboard displays.
2. Click the namespace's name to list its images.
3. To view pull instructions for a specific version, click <Icon name="more" /> next to the version. Then click **Pull instructions**.
