Data federation allows you to query and combine data from multiple sources, enabling seamless analytics across different databases or storage systems without the need to move or duplicate data. 

Scaleway Data Warehouse for ClickHouse® allows you to quickly import any type of compatible data into [bottomless storage](/data-warehouse/concepts/#bottomless-storage) with minimal configuration.

### Importing data into your deployment from an Object Storage bucket

There are several ways to import data into your Data Warehouse for ClickHouse® deployment, depending on how your data is stored. One of the most common ways is to import it from an Object Storage bucket in any format supported by ClickHouse®.

<Tabs id="import-data-into-data-warehouse">
<TabsTab label="s3 table function">
The `s3` table function reads data directly from an Object Storage bucket by specifying the URL of the bucket, the file format, and the data structure.
```sql
INSERT INTO your_table
SELECT *
FROM s3('https://my-bucket.s3.scaleway.com/data/my_data.csv', 'CSV', 'column1 String, column2 Int32')
```
</TabsTab>
<TabsTab label="s3 storage engine">
The `s3` Storage Engine creates a table that points to a data table stored in an Object Storage bucket, then inserts data from the bucket table into the target table in your Data Warehouse for ClickHouse® deployment.
```sql
    CREATE TABLE your_table_s3
    ENGINE = S3('https://my-bucket.s3.scaleway.com/data/my_data.csv', 'CSV', 'column1 String, column2 Int32')
    ```
</TabsTab>
<TabsTab label="ClickHouse® Client">
The `clickhouse-client` executes an INSERT query to populate a table in your deployment by specifying the URL of the source Object Storage bucket and the file format.
  ```sh
  clickhouse-client --query="INSERT INTO your_table FORMAT CSVWithNames" \
  --url "https://my-bucket.s3.scaleway.com/data/my_data.csv" \
  --input_format_with_names=1
  ```
