New Debian 12 Bookworm image has been released which fixes the wrong
user configuration made by the custom-built upstream `cloud-init` 23.2.

It now uses the official Debian Unstable `cloud-init` package.

Users who want to fix their existing Instances may follow [this guide](compute/instances/troubleshooting/fix-cloud-init-debian12/).
