This page shows how to create your first Scaleway Instance. An [Instance](/compute/instances/concepts/#instance) is a computing unit, either virtual or physical, that provides resources to run your applications on. After you have created your Instance, you can connect to it as root and use it as you wish.

## How to create an Instance

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Instance creation wizard displays.

    <Message type="note">
      If you have existing Instances in your account, you will see a list of
      these Instances instead of the Instance creation page, and the <Icon name="plus" />
      button for creating new Instances.
    </Message>
2. Click **Create an Instance**. The Instance creation wizard displays.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 
    - Choose an **Availability Zone**, which is the geographical region where your Instance will be deployed.
    - Choose an **Instance type**. Different Instance types have different prices, processing power, memory, storage options and bandwidth. See our dedicated documentation on [choosing an Instance type](/compute/instances/reference-content/choosing-instance-type/) to help you choose the best Instance type for your needs.
    - Choose an **Image** to run on your Instance. This can be an operating system, an InstantApp or a custom image. A complete list of all available Linux distributions and InstantApps can be found [here](https://www.scaleway.com/en/imagehub/).

    <Message type="note">
      When choosing an image for an Enterprise Instance, be aware this Instance type is not compatible with bootscripts, except for [rescue mode](/compute/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes/#how-to-use-rescue-mode). InstantApps are also not available for this Instance type.

    - Add **Volumes**. Volumes are storage spaces used by your Instances. 
      - For **GP1 Instances** you can leave the default settings of a maximum local storage, or choose how much [local](/compute/instances/concepts/#local-volumes) and/or [block](/compute/instances/concepts/#block-volumes) storage you want. Your **system volume** is the volume on which your Instance will boot. The system volume can be either a local or a block volume.
      - **PLAY2**, **PRO2**, and **Enterprise** Instances boot directly [on block volumes](/compute/instances/concepts/#boot-on-block). You can add several block volumes and define how much storage you want for each. 
    
    <Message type="important">
      Please note that:  
        - a volume with an OS image should be at least 10GB (125GB for a GPU OS).
        - if several Block Storage volumes are connected to your Instance, the first volume will contain the OS and is required to boot the Instance. You can [change your boot volume](/compute/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes/#how-to-change-the-boot-volume) after you create the Instance.
        - if you have two or more volumes with identical operating systems, or a volume with no operating system, choosing one of these as your boot volume may cause unpredictable boot behavior.
    </Message>

    - Enter a **Name** for your Instance, or leave the randomly-generated name in place. Optionally, you can also add [tags](/compute/instances/concepts/#tags) to help you organize your Instance. 
    - Click **Advanced Options** if you want to configure a [flexible IP](/compute/instances/concepts/#flexible-ip), a local bootscript or a [cloud-init configuration](/compute/instances/concepts/#cloud-init). Otherwise, leave these options at their default values. 
    - Verify the [SSH Keys](/console/my-account/concepts/#ssh-key) that will give you access to your Instance.
    - Verify the **Estimated Cost** of your Instance, based on the specifications you chose. For more help understanding Instance pricing, see our [dedicated documentation](/compute/instances/reference-content/understanding-instance-pricing/).
4. Click **Create a new Instance** to finish. The creation of your Instance begins, and you will be informed when the Instance is ready.

    Your Instance is now created and you are redirected to the **Overview** tab. From here, you can see information including your Instance's Public IP, the SSH command to use to [connect to it](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/), and other information, settings, and actions for the Instance.
