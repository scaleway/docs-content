You must always keep the contact details relating to the owner of your domain name accurate and up to date. This can be done by [following the instructions here](/dedibox-network/domains/how-to/file-contact-info). If you wish to change details about the ownerâ€™s identity, such as full name(s) or corporate name, this must be done by the change of ownership process described below.

<Message type="important">
Before changing the ownership of the domain, you must [ensure that all contact email addresses of the domain are up to date](#how-to-check-and-update-the-contact-email).
</Message>

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net) 
  - You have a domain registered with Scaleway, which you want to transfer to a new owner
  - The new owner of the domain has [created a Dedibox account](/dedibox-console/account/how-to/create-a-dedibox-account/)
</Message>

3. Click the link next to **Handle**. You are directed to the contact details page.
4. Check the details (particularly the email address), rectifying any that are incorrect.
5. Ensure the **anti spam** feature is set to **Inactive**.
6. If you have made changes, scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Update handle data**.

6. Create a handle for the new owner, including all their contact details, and click **Confirm**.
7. Confirm the ownership trade and pay the administrative fee.
8. For the extensions `.fr`, `.eu`, and `.be`, emails will be sent to both the old and new owners of the domain. Both parties are required to validate the trade by clicking the enclosed link. Without this action, the change of ownership will not be validated.
  <Message type="important">
    The validation link you will receive by email is valid for one month. To obtain a new validation link, you will need to restart the ownership change process, which leads to an administrative fee.
  </Message>
  For the extensions `.com`, `.net` and `.org`, the validation is done directly once your change of ownership request is confirmed.
You can check if the change of ownership was successful on [Who.is](http://who.is/).
