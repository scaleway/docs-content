Transactional Email is a platform that allows Scaleway clients to send [transactional emails](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#transactional-email) with high quality [deliverability](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#deliverability).

In this quickstart, we show you how to configure your domain with Transactional Email, how to add SPF, DKIM and MX records to your domain, and how to delete your domain.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)

</Message>


## How to add SPF and DKIM records to your domain

After you have configured your domain with Transactional Email, you are prompted to verify your domain by adding SPF, DKIM and MX records. You can choose to do so right after you have validated your domain, or at a later time.

1. Click **Transactional Email** in the **Managed Services** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. Your newly-added domain displays.
2. Click your domain. You are redirected to the SPF, DKIM and MX configuration page.
3. Copy the value that applies to your case to add an SPF record.
    <Message type="important">
     - If you have no SPF record on this domain, copy the following value: `v=spf1 include:_spf.scw-tem.cloud -all`
     - If you already have configured an SPF record, copy the following value: `include:_spf.scw-tem.cloud`
    </Message>

4. Add a `TXT` record type in the root zone of your domain on your DNS zone.
5. Paste the value you have copied in the root zone of your domain.
6. Add an additional `TXT` type record in the root zone of your domain on your DNS zone.
7. Copy the name that displays in the console.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_dkim_record_name.webp" alt="" />
8. Paste the name you have copied in the root zone of your domain on your DNS zone.

10. Check the box "I have added these DNS records to my DNS zone" to confirm.
11. Click **Verify domain**. Your domain displays in the list of your domains.

<Message type="note">
 The verification of your domain can take up to 48 hours.
</Message>

## How to add your own MX record

<Message type="important">
  If you do not own an MX server, we recommend [using Scaleway's blackhole MX](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/add-mx-record-to-your-domain/#how-to-add-scaleway's-mx-record) so the emails you send do not get rejected. However, this means that the **emails sent back to the MX, will be lost and unrecoverable**.
</Message>

1. Add an [MX record](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#mx-record) type in the root zone of your domain on your DNS zone.
2. Enter a name of your choice in the **Name** field.
3. Set `10` as a [priority](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#priority) for your MX record.
    <Message type="note">
     Priority indicates the order in which your mail servers should be tried by a mail server that is attempting to deliver emails.
    </Message>
4. Enter the name of your MX followed by a trailing dot in the **Hostname** field.
5. Save your changes.


## How to improve your domain reputation

The **factors** used to determine your domain's reputation score **vary from one service to another**.
The only constant common denominator is that the **receiving platforms determine how your domain is used in your emails** and then **monitor how their users receive these emails**.
Each domain has several reputations associated with different mail receivers. Reputation also depends on the volume of emails you send to specific receivers.

Read our [documentation](/managed-services/transactional-email/reference-content/understanding-tem-reputation-score/) to find out how to improve or maintain a good domain [reputation](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#reputation-score) score.
