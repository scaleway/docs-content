  This page concerns the **VPC** / **Regional Private Networks** product currently in [Private Beta](https://www.scaleway.com/en/betas/#regional-private-network). If you're looking for documentation about Public Gateways, see the [relocated concepts page](/network/public-gateways/concepts/) for that product.

## VPC

Scaleway's **V**irtual **P**rivate **C**loud (VPC) allows you to connect your Scaleway resources in secure, isolated regional Private Networks, not accessible from the public Internet.

## Regional Private Networks

While Scaleway's original [Private Networks](/network/public-gateways/how-to/use-private-networks/) product offers connectivity of your resources within a single Availability Zone (AZ), regional Private Networks lets you connect resources across multiple AZs within the same region. Regional Private Networks are currently only available for the Paris region.
