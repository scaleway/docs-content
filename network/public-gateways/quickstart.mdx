## How to create a Public Gateway

1. Click **Public Gateways** in the **Network** section of the side menu.
2. Click **Create Public Gateway** to launch the Public Gateway creation wizard.
3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Choose an **Availability Zone**, which is the geographical location in which your Public Gateway will be created. Note that in order to attach a Public Gateway to a Private Network, they must be in the same Availability Zone.
    - Choose a **Public Gateway Type**, which impacts the pricing and bandwidth of your gateway.
    - Choose an **IP**. You can choose to assign one of your existing Flexible IPs to your Public Gateway. Otherwise, a new IP will be automatically assigned here. 
    - Choose **Name** for your Public Gateway, and (optionally) a description and tags.
    - Verify the **Estimated Cost** of your Public Gateway, based on the specifications you chose.
4. Click **Create Public Gateway** to finish.

    Your Public Gateway is created and you are redirected to the **Public Gateways** dashboard, where your newly-created Public Gateway now displays.

## How to attach your Public Gateway to a Private Network

1. Click **Public Gateways** in the **Network** section of the side menu.
2. Click the Public Gateway that you want to attach to a Private Network. You are taken to the **Overview** page for that Public Gateway. 
3. Click the **Private Networks** tab. A list of Private Networks attached to the Public Gateway displays.
4. Click <Icon name="plus" /> to attach a new Private Network to the Public Gateway. A pop-up displays.
5. Choose to attach an existing or a new Private Network.
    - If you want to attach an existing Private Network, select **Select and attach an existing Private Network** and choose the desired network from the drop-down list.
    <Message type="note">
        Note: Only Private Networks which are in the same Availability Zone as the Public Gateway are displayed in this list.
    </Message>
    - If you want to create and attach a new Private Network, select **Create and attach a new Private Network**. A default name will be suggested for you, but feel free to overwrite this with a new name of your choice.
    - Choose whether to **Enable** or **Disable** the DHCP server:
        - **Enable DHCP**: The Public Gateway will dynamically assign IP addresses to Instances in the Private Network. Enabling DHCP also enables the advertisement of a default route and DNS server through the Public Gateway. Both of these options can be disabled later.
        - **Disable DHCP**: None of the above functionalities will be applied.
    - Choose the subnet you would like to use for this network, e.g. `192.168.42.0/24`. You may find the note [here](/compute/instances/how-to/use-private-networks/) helpful if you are having difficulty choosing a subnet. Alternatively, click **Auto** to auto-generate a subnet, if you have enabled DHCP.
    - Choose whether to **Enable** or **Disable** Dynamic NAT:
        - **Enable Dynamic NAT**: Private IP addresses in the Private Network are automatically mapped to the public IP address of the Public Gateway, enabling automatic routing of egress traffic to and from multiple devices within the Private Network. Note: you will also be able to configure static NAT settings for ingress traffic.
        - **Disable Dynamic NAT**: The above functionality is not applied.
5. Click **Attach Private Network** to finish. You are taken back to the Private Networks tab, where the network you attached now appears, along with the services configured and the IP address of the Public Gateway.

    Your Private Network is now attached to your Public Gateway. You can repeat the steps above to attach more Private Networks to the same Public Gateway if you wish.

## How to attach and detach resources to/from a Private Network

1. Click **Private Networks** in the **Network** section of the side menu.
2. Click the Private Network you want to add/remove resources to. Alternatively, click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the Private Network in question and select **More Info** from the dropdown list. You are taken to the **Overview** page for that network.
3. Click the **Attached Resources** tab.
4. Use the dropdown menu to select a **resource type** to add to your Private Network, then select the **resource** itself. Click **Add Resource** to finish. Remember, only resources in the same Availability Zone as the Private Network will appear in the dropdown list. 

    To **detach a resource**, use the <Icon name="unlink" /> icon next to the resource in question to remove it from your Private Network. Confirm this action when prompted by clicking **Detach resource**.
