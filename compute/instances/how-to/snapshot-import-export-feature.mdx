The snapshot transfer feature allows you to export or import Instance snapshots. Snapshots are created using the QCOW2 format and stored in a Scaleway Object Storage Bucket.

A snapshot stored in a Scaleway Object Storage bucket can be imported into any Availability Zone (AZ), as long as it is in the same region as the bucket. This allows you to create Instances in different AZs within the same region. For example, you can deploy Instances in `fr-par-2` based on the snapshot exported from an Instance in `fr-par-1`.

More information on the QCOW2 file format and how to use it can be found in the [QEMU documentation](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html#cmdoption-image-formats-arg-qcow2).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
- An [Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) using [Block Storage volumes](/storage/block/how-to/create-a-volume/)
- An [Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)

## Creating a snapshot from your existing Instance

<Message type="note">
For this guide, we assume you have an Instance running in the `fr-par-1` AZ, your Object Storage bucket is located in the region `fr-par`, and you want to create a new Instance in the `fr-par-2` AZ.
</Message>

1. Click the [Instances section](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) of the Scaleway console, then click the **Snapshots** tab.
2. Click **+ Create snapshot**. The snapshot creation wizard appears. Enter a name and select the volume to snapshot. Then click **Create snapshot**. The snapshot is created, and the list of all your snapshots displays.

3. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the relevant snapshot, and select **Copy to bucket**. A pop-up displays. Enter the file name for your exported snapshot copy and select the destination bucket. Then click **Copy snapshot to bucket**.

## Importing the snapshot into the destination AZ

1. Click the [Object Storage section](https://console.scaleway.com/object-storage/buckets) of the Scaleway console, then click the bucket to which you have exported the snapshot. The snapshot copy should display in the list of your objects.
    <Message type="note">
    Depending on the size of your snapshot, the export to Object Storage may take some time. It is ready once the status indicator changes to green.
    </Message>
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the snapshot copy, then click **Import as snapshot**. A pop-up will appear. Enter the name of the snapshot, select the destination AZ, and choose the snapshot type.
    The type can be either **Local SSD** or **Block SSD**. Click **Import file as snapshot** to import the snapshot into the destination AZ.
    <Message type="important">
      - Ensure that the QCOW / QCOW2 image file you want to import uses the file extension `.qcow` or `.qcow2` to avoid issues during import.
      - Imported snapshots must have a volume size between 1 GB and 1 TB.
    </Message>

## Creating Instances from the imported snapshot

1. Click the [Instances section](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) of the Scaleway console, then click **+Create Instance**.
2. Select the Availability Zone into which you have imported the snapshot and the desired Instance type. Under **Choose an image**, click **My snapshots** to select the imported snapshot.
3. Optionally, add additional volumes, enter a name and optional tags. Once your configuration is complete, click **Create Instance** to launch the Instance creation process.

You can now connect to your new Instance using SSH. It will have the same software configuration as the source Instance.
