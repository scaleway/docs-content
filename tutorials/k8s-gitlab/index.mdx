GitLab provides a built-in Kubernetes integration that allows you to build, test, deploy, and run your app at scale.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the `gitlab` Kubernetes integration using a [Scaleway Instance](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/). The Instance will be deployed using the Scaleway `gitlab` InstantApp.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An Instance running the [`gitlab` InstantApp](/tutorials/gitlab-instant-app/)
- [Created a Kapsule cluster](/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/).
- Downloaded the corresponding [kubeconfig](/kubernetes/how-to/edit-cluster/) file and ensured [kubectl](/kubernetes/how-to/connect-cluster-kubectl/) is working
- Installed [Helm client](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

## Configuring GitLab runner using Helm charts

### Installing helm

In this tutorial, we use `helm` to deploy a `gitlab` runner on a `Kapsule` cluster.

Ensure you're using the latest version of Helm, which is Helm 3.16.2.

#### Installation Steps:

1. Download Helm
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
  chmod 700 get_helm.sh
  ./get_helm.sh
  ```

2. Verify the installation:
  ```bash
  helm version
  ```
  Ensure the output shows version 3.16.2.

The `helm` charts are provided through repositories. By default `helm` 3 does not have any repository configured.
We will add the `gitlab` repository, as it provides the necessary chart to install the runner.

```
helm repo add gitlab https://charts.gitlab.io
"gitlab" has been added to your repositories
helm repo update
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Successfully got an update from the "gitlab" chart repository
Update Complete. ⎈ Happy Helming!⎈
```

### Installing GitLab runners using Helm

A `helm` chart is always shipped with a `value.yaml` file. It can be edited to customize the deployment of the application.

In this part of the tutorial we customize the `value.yaml` to fit our needs and deploy the runner on `kapsule`.

1. Fetch the latest `values.yaml` file:
    ```
    wget https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab-runner/-/raw/main/values.yaml
    ```

    Each `gitlab` runner needs a registration token to register on the `gitlab` server.
    Retrieve the registration token from the GitLab web interface ("Admin Area" > "Runners"):

    <Lightbox image={image} alt="" />

    <Lightbox image={image2} alt="" />

2. Open the file in a text editor and update the following fields in `values.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    gitlabUrl: http://<your-gitlab-instance>/
    runnerRegistrationToken: "<your-registration-token>"
    rbac:
      create: true
      serviceAccountName: default
    ```
    Ensure you replace `<your-gitlab-instance>` and `<your-registration-token>` with your actual GitLab Instance URL and registration token.

    <Message type="tip">
      By default, the gitlabUrl and the registration token lines are written as a comment in the `values.yaml`file. Make sure you have deleted the `#` before saving.
    </Message>

3. To install the `gitlab` runner, create it on your `Kapsule` cluster. We will use a dedicated [namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/).
    ```
    kubectl create ns gitlab-runner
    ```
    The following output displays `namespace/gitlab-runner created`.

    The default service account should use a new Kubernetes [role](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#role-example), and [rolebinding](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#rolebinding-example).
4. Use the following example to create a role and role binding and associate it to the default service account in the `gitlab-runner` namespace:
    ```
    cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Role
    metadata:
      name: gitlab-runner
      namespace: gitlab-runner
    rules:
      - apiGroups: [""]
        resources: ["pods"]
        verbs: ["list", "get", "watch", "create", "delete"]
      - apiGroups: [""]
        resources: ["pods/exec"]
        verbs: ["create"]
      - apiGroups: [""]
        resources: ["pods/log"]
        verbs: ["get"]
    EOF
    kubectl create rolebinding --namespace=gitlab-runner gitlab-runner-binding --role=gitlab-runner --serviceaccount=gitlab-runner:default
    ```
5. Use the `helm` command to install the runner (note that you specify in this command line the `values.yaml` file):
    ```
    helm install --namespace gitlab-runner gitlab-runner -f ./values.yaml gitlab/gitlab-runner --version 0.68.1
    NAME: gitlab-runner
    LAST DEPLOYED: Wed May  6 15:48:20 2020
    NAMESPACE: gitlab-runner
    STATUS: deployed
    REVISION: 1
    TEST SUITE: None
    NOTES:
    Your GitLab Runner should now be registered against the GitLab instance reachable at: "http://212.47.xxx.yyy/"
    ```
    The command above installs the GitLab Runner Helm chart version 0.68.1 in the `gitlab-runner` namespace.
    You can check the runner is working in the `gitlab` console ("admin area" > runners):

## Running a pipeline in the runner using a test app

To demonstrate that the runner is working, we [create a repository](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/#create-a-repository) with a "hello world" piece of code written in Python.

1. Create the files using a text editor of your choice (e.g. `nano` or `vim`). In this tutorial, we use `nano`.
    ```bash
    nano helloworld.py
    ```
2. Create the content of the file as follows, save and exit:
    ```python
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```
3. Create an associated gitlab-ci file to check it is running in the runner we just deployed:
    ```bash
    nano .gitlab-ci.yaml
    ```
4. Create the content of the file as follows, save and exit:
    ```yaml
    image: ubuntu
    hello-test:
      script:
        - apt-get update && apt-get install python3
        - python3 helloworld.py
    ```
5. Push the repository and an Ubuntu container is launched. At first `apt` is updated, and `python3` is installed, and then the “hello, world” script is launched in the terminal.
