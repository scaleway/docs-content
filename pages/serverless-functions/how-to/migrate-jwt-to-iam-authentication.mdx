<Message type="important">
  - February 16, 2026: Creating new JWT tokens will no longer be possible
  - The authentication method with existing tokens remains available. Only the creation of new tokens will no longer be supported
</Message>

Scaleway Serverless Functions used to rely on [legacy JWT authentication tokens](/serverless-functions/concepts/#jwt-token-legacy) to access private resources.

This feature is now deprecated, you must therefore use Scaleway IAM to access your private functions using an [API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/). This change allows for a better Scaleway ecosystem integration. Read the documentation on [advanced access control with IAM conditions](/serverless-functions/how-to/secure-a-function/#advanced-access-control-with-iam-conditions) for more information.access-control-with-iam-conditions).


1. [Set up IAM authentication](/serverless-functions/how-to/create-auth-token-from-console/) by creating an IAM application bearing an API key, and grant it the `FunctionsPrivateAccess` via an IAM policy.

2. [Delete the existing JWT](/serverless-functions/how-to/create-auth-token-from-console/#revoking-authentication/?tab=jwt-legacy-11) for your Serverless Functions to revoke legacy authentication.

3. Pass the secret key of your IAM application's API key via the `X-Auth-Token` header to call your private function:

```bash
curl -H "X-Auth-Token: <YOUR_SECRET_KEY>" <YOUR_FUNCTION_ENDPOINT>
```

<Message type="note">
- Existing tokens will continue to work
- Reading (`GET`/`LIST`) and deleting (`DELETE`) JWT tokens will remain available until February 2026
- No application code changes are required, only header value updates
</Message>
