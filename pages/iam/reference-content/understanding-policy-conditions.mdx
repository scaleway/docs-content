A condition is an additional layer of restrictions for your rule. You can configure conditions in IAM policies to allow access to specific user agents, IP addresses and on a given date or time.

At Scaleway, IAM conditions are defined using Common Expression Language (CEL) expressions.

## Condition expressions

An expression can be compared to a conditional statement in programming. It is a logical statement that evaluates to either true or false. The result determines whether the permission set defined in the rule is applied or not.

Condition expressions are composed of one or several statements that declare a rule based on attributes. Attributes are like characteristics or properties of a request, resource or a user. For example, an attribute might be a given date or time, or an IP address.

Expressions at Scaleway are defined in CEL, which provides a human-readable and flexible method of creating conditions.

## Common Expression Language

Common Expression Language is used to specify a IAM condition expression.

Expressions consist of one or more statements that declare an attribute-based control rule, and determine whether a permission applies.

IAM conditions use the following CEL features:
    - Variables
    - Operators and Logical Operators
    - Functions

### Variables

Conditions use variables to express attributes. Variables are populated with values based on the context at runtime.

| Name | Type         | Description |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ------ |
| `request.ip` | String | The IP address of the request.   |
| `request.time` | `google.protobuf.Timestamp` | The time of the request. Represented as a Protobuf object, allowing usage with [associated functions](https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md#datetime-functions).|
| `request.user_agent`    | String        | The user-agent of the request. Truncated at 255 characters max.|

### Operators

Every data type, such as `timestamp` or `string`, supports a set of operators that can be used to create a logic expression.

Most commonly, operators are used to compare the value contained in a variable with a literal value.

For example, `==` is the operator in the following statement:

```
request.time == "2025-03-03T14:30:00.000Z"
```

Refer to the official [CEL syntax specification](https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md#syntax) for list of supported operators.

#### Logical operators

Conditions support three logical operators that can be used to build complex logic expressions from basic expression statements:

| Logical operator | Description | Example |
| -- | ------------------- | ------ |
| `&&` (AND) | Evaluates to true if both expressions are true. | `request.time.getFullYear() < 2020 && request.ip == '10.154.3.1'` |
| `\|\|` (OR) | Evaluates to true if either expression is true. If the first expression is true, the second expression may not be evaluated. |  `request.time.getFullYear() < 2020  \|\| request.ip == '10.154.3.1'` |
| `!` (NOT) | Evaluates to true if the expression is false, and false if the expression is true. | `!(request.time.getFullYear() < 2020)` |


### Functions

A function is a compound operator for data types, that supports more complex operations. In condition expressions, predefined functions can be used with a given data type.

All standard CEL functions are supported, as well as the following custom Scaleway IAM function(s):

| Function | Description | Parameters |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ------ |
| `inIpRange(IP: string, Subnet: string)` | Checks if the IP address is included in the IP subnet. | **IP**: (String) The IP address to check. |
|  | | **Subnet**: (String) The IP subnet to check against. |


## Important considerations

### Multiple policies
If multiple policies with different conditions apply to the same principal, the presence of a single policy with met conditions (or no conditions) will override any denying rules from other policies, allowing the action to be taken.

For example, if you set up a policy that grants access to a resource only on Monday while another policy grants access only on Tuesday, the action will still be allowed on Monday. The access will be granted on both days.

### Timezones

We recommend that you specify timezones when creating time-based conditions.

Refer to the official [CEL specification](https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md#timezones) for the correct syntax to express timezones in conditions.

### Timestamps

Conditions based on timestamps might take up to a minute to be applied.

For example, if a user has permission to perform an action until 11am, they may be able to perform it until 11:01am.

### IAM condition limitations

Currently it is only possible to edit conditions in the console using the **Advanced** expression editor.

When creating a policy, you can define a simple condition expression with the help of the console form. When editing, you must define the changes by writing them in CEL in the Advanced editor.

## Expression examples

### User-agent conditions

In the example below we check if the user-agent contains the term "Terraform":
```
request.user_agent.contains("terraform/")
```

### Time conditions

To only allow actions within a specific timeslot you can use the following expression. In this example, use weekdays from 9am to 5pm as a timestamp.
```
request.time.getDayOfWeek() != 0 && request.time.getDayOfWeek() != 6
&& request.time.getHours("Europe/Paris") < 17
&& request.time.getHours("Europe/Paris") > 8
```

To only allow requests that were performed over the weekend, you can use the expression below:
```
request.time.getDayOfWeek() != 0 && request.time.getDayOfWeek() != 6
```
