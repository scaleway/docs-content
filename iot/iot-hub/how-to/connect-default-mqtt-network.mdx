The default network, which is automatically created with a Hub, is a **MQTT network**. The a default network, cannot be deleted.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have [created an IoT Hub](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/create-hub)

</Message>


1. [Add a Hub device](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/add-device) if you haven't already done so.  
To keep this tutorial simple, choose to `Allow Insercure` connections. Insecure connections allow connections to the hub without encryption layer.

2. Configure the physical device (or client) to connect through the network, using the following parameters:

    - Host: The network endpoint.
    - Port: Use `1883` for plaintext or `8883` for TLS.
    - MQTT Username: The *device ID* from the device you created earlier.
    - If your client asks for a password, just pass in an empty string.

  <Message type="note">

    If you have configured your device to force mTLS (`Deny Insecure` connections), you will also need to provide the device certificate & private key, so that during the TLS handshake, the Hub will be able to verify the device identity. 

  </Message>
 
3. Connect and exchange messages.

Some networks support topic prefixes, but the default networks do not. The whole "topic space" is available to MQTT clients.
