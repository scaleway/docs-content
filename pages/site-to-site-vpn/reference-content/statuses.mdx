## VPN gateway statuses

An VPN gateway always has a **status**, which can be retrieved via the API using the **Get a VPN gateway** call.

This section explains the different statuses possible for a VPN gateway, and how to understand them.

| **Status**             | **Description**                         | 
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Provisioning**       | The **create** action has been triggered, and Scaleway is provisioning the gateway. This status should be momentary: if it persists, contact support. |
| **Active**             | The VPN gateway has been created successfully, and is now operational. |
| **Failed**             | Scaleway was unable to create the VPN gateway. Wait a few seconds and refresh to check the status does not change. If the problem persists, contact support. |
| **Configuring**        | The gateway is configuring and is in a transient state. No user actions can be carried out. This status generally occurs while a new configuration is being applied, e.g. you have modified its settings. This status should be momentary: if it persists, contact support. |
| **Locked**             | The gateway has been locked by the Trust and Safety team. You cannot carry out any actions on the gateway. Open a support ticket. |
| **Deprovisioning**     |The **delete** action has been triggered, and Scaleway is deprovisioning the gateway. This status should be momentary: if it persists, contact support. |

## Connection statuses

A Site-to-Site VPN connection also always has a **status**, separate to that of the VPN gateway which can be retrieved via the API using the **Get a connection** call.

This section explains the different statuses possible for a connection, and how to understand them.

| **Status**             | **Description**                         | 
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Active**             | The connection has been created, and the BGP session(s) between the two gateways are both up. Traffic can flow through the connection's tunnel(s). |
| **Limited connectivity**   | The connection has been created, but IP connectivity is limited. This may be the case if the connection has both an IPv4 and an IPv6 routing policy attached, but only one of the two associated BGP sessions is up.|
| **Down**       | The connection has been created, but either a) the customer gateway device is not yet successfully configured and the tunnel(s) cannot be established, or b) no BGP sessions (neither IPv4 not IPv6) are up, and without route announcements no traffic can flow through the tunnel.|
| **Locked**             | The connection has been locked by the Trust and Safety team. You cannot carry out any actions on the connection. Open a support ticket. |
