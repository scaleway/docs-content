Serverless Jobs is now natively integrated with Secret Manager.

This allows for seamless retrieval of your sensitive data like API keys, database credentials. This integration reduces complexity while enhancing security by keeping your secrets out of your codebase. Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/serverless/jobs/how-to/reference-secret-in-job/) for more information.
