[RPN SAN](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/storage/rpn-san/) is a performance-oriented SAN storage network solution (Storage Area Network) accessible in block mode and available in iSCSI through the RPN private network of your Dedibox.

<Message type="requirement">
  * You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net)
  * You have a [Dedibox dedicated server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/)
  * You have an [RPN SAN](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/storage/rpn-san/)
</Message>

<Message type="important">
  - RPN SAN does not support RPNv2. To use RPNv2, you either need a server with an RPNv1 connection **or** to [enable the RPNv1 gateway](/dedibox-network/rpn/how-to/configure-rpnv1-gateway).
  - You must authorize the server(s) to connect to your RPN SAN.
</Message>

## How to authorize servers to connect to a SAN

1. Enter the [RPN SAN configuration](https://console.online.net/en/server/rpn/san) by clicking **Storage** > **RPN SAN**. The list of your SANs displays.
2. Click **Manage** next to the SAN you want to configure:

3. Configure access to the SAN. You can allow connections either by using the server ID or by their RPN IP-address. Then Click **Save** to validate the configuration.

The allowed server(s) are listed on the SAN overview page.

<Message type="tip">
  Some SAN endpoints may not be reachable directly from the RPNv2 and it is required to configure an [RPNv1 gateway](/dedibox-network/rpn/how-to/configure-rpnv1-gateway/) to use them with RPNv2.

## How to add a SAN to an RPN group

<Message type="tip">
  Recent SANs must be a member of an RPN group to be accessible. If your SAN is located on a SAN target >24 for SAN HA or >24 for SAN basic, you need to add the RPN SAN to your RPN group to access it.
</Message>

<Message type="note">
  **⚠ You must create or add your SAN RPN in an RPNv1 group with your servers.**
</Message>

1. Access the [RPN group](https://console.online.net/en/server/rpn) configuration by clicking **RPN** > **RPN groups** The list of your RPN groups displays.
2. Click **Create group**. The group creation form displays. Enter a name for the new group and tick the checkboxes of your Dedibox and the RPN SAN you want to grant access to. Then click **Create group** to confirm. The RPN group is scheduled for creation. 
3. Once the status of your group changes to **Active** the group is ready to be used and your Dedibox is able to communicate with the SAN.
