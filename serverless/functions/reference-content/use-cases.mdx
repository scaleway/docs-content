Scaleway Serverless Functions can be used in endless use cases:
* Automation for specific tasks
* Integration with your ecosystem to help scale specific routes of your code
* CI/CD integration
* Data analysis and processing
* Optimizing infrastructures with scaling from, and to zero
* Decoupling software, and more.

For a better understanding of Serverless Functions, we provide real-world examples in our [serverless-examples repository](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-examples/).
Here are some specific cases:

## Node - Interact with databases

This example shows how to connect to a managed PostgreSQL database and perform a query on it.

## Python - ChatBot

This example shows how to handle different HTTP methods (POST and GET) as well as specific dependencies.

## Go - SQS Publish message

You can use this example to publish a message to an SQS queue using the MNQ namespace from the Scaleway Go SDK.

## PHP - Repository Badge Generator

This example demonstrates how PHP functions work using a dependency from Composer. With this example, you can generate a simple badge with the text, status, and color of your choice.

## Rust - Character recognition
