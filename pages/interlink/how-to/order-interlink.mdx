InterLink is currently in [Private Beta](https://www.scaleway.com/en/betas/), and only available to selected testers.
</Message>

InterLink is Scaleway's product to let you create a secure, private connection between your external infrastructure, and your Scaleway VPC. This allows you to direct your traffic safely from your Scaleway infrastructure to your on-premises infrastructure, away from the public internet.

Currently, InterLink is available in **hosted** version only. This means that you must choose a compatible [partner](/interlink/concepts/#partner) to facilitate the physical connection between the external infrastructure and the Scaleway VPC.

This guide takes you through the process of ordering an InterLink via the Scaleway console.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to order an InterLink

1. Click **InterLink** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. If you have not already created an InterLink, the product ordering page is displayed.

2. Click **Order InterLink**. The order wizard displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-order-interlink.webp" alt="A screen of the Scaleway console shows the InterLink order form. The different sections are explained in the steps below." />

3. Select a [connection type](/interlink/concepts/#connection-type), the type of physical InterLink connection. For now, only **hosted** connections are available.

4. Select a [partner](/interlink/concepts/#partner). To establish an InterLink connection via a partner, generally you must be client of that partner, e.g. with your infrastructure in their datacenter, or on your own premises using the partner as a network provider. [Get help with choosing a partner](/interlink/reference-content/overview/#hosted-interlinks).

5. Choose a [region](/interlink/concepts/#partner) for your InterLink. This must correspond to the Scaleway VPC you want to attach later.

6. Choose a [location](/interlink/concepts/#partner) for your InterLink. This represents the physical location where the connection to Scaleway's network will be established.

7. Choose a [bandwidth](/interlink/concepts/#bandwidth) amount. This represents the maximum bandwidth that will be available over the InterLink.

8. Enter a name and optional tags for your InterLink.

9. Check the estimated cost for your InterLink. Note that Scaleway will start billing you for the InterLInk as soon as you order it. You must then wait for your partner to provision the connection, who may charge you additional fees.

10. Click **Order InterLink**.

Your InterLink is ordered, and its status briefly shows as `Configuring`, then `Requested`. **You must now contact your chosen partner to request they provision your InterLink from their end.**

<Lightbox src="scaleway-interlink-ordering.webp" alt="A four step flow chart shows the following steps: 1. User orders InterLink via Scaleway, 2. User requests InterLink from partner, 3. Partner accepts InterLink request, 4. Partner provisions InterLink." />

For full details of the provisioning process, including how to contact your partner and what other steps you need to take, see the page [How to complete InterLink provisioning](/interlink/how-to/complete-provisioning/).

<Message type="important">
If you see a `Failed` status, it means there was a configuration error on the Scaleway side as we attempted to create the InterLink. Our technical team is automatically made aware of such a problem, and will intervene to resolve it. When the problem is resolved, the InterLink should automatically move to `Requested` status, and you can proceed to [completing provisioning](/interlink/how-to/complete-provisioning/). If you have any concerns, open a support ticket.
