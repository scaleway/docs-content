If you're coming to this tutorial as a complete Python beginner, make sure you're familiar with the Python concepts covered in our [Python for complete beginners](/tutorials/get-started-python/) tutorial, and with [dictionaries and lists](/docs/tutorials/python-lists-dicts/).

## Introduction

So you know how to **create variables** in Python`(`my_variable = 3`), as well as how to **create lists** (`my_list = [3, 5, 9, 6]`) and **dictionaries** (`my_dict = {"Sara": 3 "Aneesa": 5, "Emmanuel": 9, "Tom": 6}`) to store multiple items in a single variable? Then you're ready to learn about **loops**.

A **loop** is a piece of code that tells Python to repeat a specified set of actions multiple times. Loops are a fundamental part of most programming languages, and let you achieve a whole lot with just a few lines of code. Often, they **iterate** over collections of data (such as data held in dictionaries or lists) and carry out all sorts of operations on those collections.

Why are loops useful? Let's look at a quick example:

Imagine you have a list of numbers, and you want to find every number higher than 10. Without a loop, the code is very long and repetitive:

```python
my_list = [3, 10.1, 62, 9]

if my_list[0] > 10:
  print(my_list[0])

if my_list[1] > 10:
  print(my_list[1])

if my_list[2] > 10:
  print(my_list[2])

if my_list[3] > 10:
  print(my_list[3])
```

Output:
```python
10.1
62
```

With a for loop, we can do it in just three lines of code:

```python
for number in my_list:
  if number > 10:
    print(number)
```

Output:
```python
10.1
62
```

Let's dive into the world of for loops in python, and learn how to code them and what we can do with them.

## Types of loop in Python

There are two types of loop in Python:

|  | For loop | While loop |
|---|---|---|
| Syntax | for element in sequence:<br />  do this | while condition:<br />  do this |
| Example | ## this is outside the loop<br />colors = ["red","yellow","green"]<br /><br />## the loop starts here<br />for x in colors:<br />   print(x)<br /><br /><br />## output:<br />red<br />yellow<br />green | ## this is outside the loop<br />number = 0<br /><br />## the loop starts here<br />while number \<3:<br /> print(number)<br /> number+=1<br /><br />## output:<br />0<br />1<br />2 |
| How does it work? | - The loop will have as many iterations as there are elements in the sequence<br />- In this case there are three elements (here, strings) in our sequence (here, a list)<br />- For the first iteration, the variable x in the loop takes on the value "red". Next iteration it will take on the value "yellow", etc.<br />- The action (printing the variable x, i.e. the color) is carried out for every element in the sequence<br />- When there are no more elements left in the sequence, the loop ends | - The condition (number is less than 3) is evaluated as we enter the loop<br />- If it is true, the two statements are carried out: the number is printed, and then its value is increased by 1<br />- The condition is evaluated again, and if it is still true, the two statements are carried out again<br />- This continues until the condition evaluates to false, at which point the loop ends |
| Useful for | - Iterating over a sequence or collection of data, and carrying out actions on each element<br />- Carrying out some operation(s) a fixed number of times | - Carrying out some operation(s) when you don't know the exact number of times the loop needs to run<br />- Carrying out some operation(s) dependent on a condition that may or may not be predictable |
