## Overview 

### What is serverless computing, and how does it differ from traditional cloud hosting?

Serverless computing is a cloud execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of compute resources. Unlike traditional hosting models, you do not need to provision, scale, or maintain servers. Instead, you focus solely on writing and deploying your code, and the infrastructure scales automatically to meet demand.

### Why consider using Serverless Containers, Functions, or Jobs for my projects?

These services allow you to build highly scalable, event-driven, and pay-as-you-go solutions. Serverless Containers and Functions help you create applications and microservices without worrying about server management, while Serverless Jobs lets you run large-scale, parallel batch-processing tasks efficiently. This can lead to faster development cycles, reduced operational overhead, and cost savings.

### What are the cost benefits of using serverless services like Serverless Containers and Serverless Functions?

With serverless, you only pay for the computing resources you use. There are no upfront provisioning costs or paying for idle capacity. When your application traffic is low, the cost scales down, and when traffic spikes, the platform automatically scales up, ensuring you never overpay for unused resources.

## Billing

### How am I billed for Serverless Functions?

#### Principle

Serverless Functions is billed on a pay-as-you-go basis. Three components are taken into account:

* **Monthly request number:** each time your function is invoked we increase a counter.

* **Resource consumption:** this component is obtained by multiplying the memory tiers chosen by the duration of each function invocation.

* **Resources provision:** in order to mitigate cold start, users can choose to keep some function instances warm (by filing the minimum scale value). We then charge for the provisioned resources similarly to the Resources consumption component.

The scheme below illustrates our billing model:

<Lightbox src={["scaleway-Billing-FaaS-1-DEF.webp", "scaleway-Billing-FaaS-2-DEF.webp"]} size={"medium"}  alt={["Functions Billing", "Functions Billing"]} />

#### Pricing

* **Monthly requests:** **€0.15 per million requests**, and we offer **1M free requests** per account per month.

* **Resources consumption:** **€1.20 per 100 000 GB-s**, and we provide **400 000 GB-s free tiers** per account and per month.

## Resources and performance

### How to select the right resources (vCPU/RAM) for Serverless Functions ?

Insufficient vCPU and RAM resources can lead to functions going to error status. Make sure to provision enough resources for your function.

We recommend you set high values, [use metrics to monitor](/serverless-functions/how-to/monitor-function/) the resource usage of your function, then adjust the value accordingly.

### How does scaling work in these serverless services?

Scaling in Serverless Containers and Serverless Functions is handled automatically by the platform. When demand increases - more requests or events - the platform spins up additional instances to handle the load. When demand decreases, instances spin down. This ensures optimal performance without manual intervention.

### Can I upgrade Serverless Function resources (vCPU and RAM) at any time?

Yes, Serverless Functions resources can be changed at any time without causing downtime, see the previous question for full details.

### Does updating a Serverless Function cause downtime?

No, deploying a new version of your Serverless Function generates a **rolling update**. This means that a new version of the service is gradually
rolled out to your users without downtime. Here is how it works:

* When a new version of your function is deployed, the platform automatically starts routing traffic to the new version incrementally, while still serving requests from the old version until the new one is fully deployed.
* Once the new version is successfully running, we gradually shift all traffic to it, ensuring zero downtime.
* The old version is decommissioned once the new version is fully serving traffic.

This process ensures a seamless update experience, minimizing user disruption during deployments. If needed, you can also manage traffic splitting between versions during the update process, allowing you to test new versions with a subset of traffic before fully migrating to them.

### How to reduce cold-start of Serverless Functions?

* **Optimize the startup**: Cold-start can be affected by a loading a large number of dependencies and opening lot of resources at startup.
Ensure that your code avoids heavy computations or long-running initialization at startup and optimize the number of loaded libraries.

* **Keep your function warm**: You can use CRON triggers at certain intervals to keep your function warm or set the min-scale parameter to one when required.

* **Increase resources**: Adding more vCPU and RAM can help to significantly reduce the cold-starts of your function.

* **Use sandbox v2**: We recommend using sandbox v2 (advanced settings) to reduce cold start.

### What are the limitations of Serverless Functions?

Refer to our dedicated page about [Serverless Functions limitations and configuration restrictions](/serverless-functions/reference-content/functions-limitations/) for more information.

### What runtimes are available on Serverless Functions?

Serverless Functions enables you to deploy functions using popular languages: `Go`, `Node`, `Python`, `PHP`, and `Rust`.

Refer to our dedicated page about [Serverless Functions Runtimes Lifecycle](/serverless-functions/reference-content/functions-runtimes/)

### Why does my function have an instance running after deployment, even with min-scale 0?

Currently, a new function instance will always start after each deployment, even if there is no traffic and the minimum
scale is set to `0`. This behavior is not configurable at this time.

## Usage

### How can I deploy my functions?

There are [several ways to deploy Serverless Functions](/serverless-functions/reference-content/deploy-function/), to accommodate a broad range of use cases.

### How do I integrate my serverless solutions with other Scaleway services?

Integration is straightforward. Serverless Functions and Containers can be triggered by events from [Queues](/messaging/concepts/#queues) and [Topics and Events](/messaging/concepts/#topics-and-events), and can easily communicate with services like [Managed Databases](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/) or [Serverless databases](/serverless-sql-databases/). [Serverless Jobs](/serverless-jobs/) can pull data from [Object Storage](/object-storage/), or output processed results into a database. With managed connectors, APIs, and built-in integrations, linking to the broader Scaleway ecosystem is seamless.

### How can I check build errors?

Some Serverless runtimes (ex: `Go`, `Rust`) will compile your code in order to make your function executable.
Compilation can fail if errors are present in the code, for example syntax errors and missing libraries.

Build errors are sent to the Observability platform on Scaleway Cockpit.

In the `Serverless Functions Logs` dashboard, you will then be able to read information about your log build outputs, if errors occurred during compilation.

### How can I test my functions locally?

 Scaleway provides libraries to run your functions locally, for debugging, profiling, and testing purposes. Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/serverless-functions/reference-content/local-testing/) for more information.

### Where can I find some advanced code examples for functions?

Check out our [serverless-examples repository](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-examples) for real world projects.

### How to migrate runtimes?

There are no constraints when changing a function runtime, you simply need to choose the runtime version you want.
Upgrading a runtime is highly recommended in case of deprecation, and for runtimes that have reached end-of-support or end-of-life. See the [functions runtimes lifecycle documentation](/serverless-functions/reference-content/functions-runtimes/) for more information.

## Network and storage

### How can I configure access to a Private Network or Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)?

Scaleway Serverless Functions does not currently support Scaleway VPC or Private Networks, though this feature is under development.

To add network restrictions on your resource, consult the [list of prefixes used at Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/en/peering/). Note that Serverless resources do not have dedicated or predictable IP addresses.

### Can I allow to list the IPs of my functions?

Serverless Functions does not yet support Private Networks. However, you can use the Scaleway IP ranges defined at [https://www.scaleway.com/en/peering/](https://www.scaleway.com/en/peering/) on Managed Databases and other products that allow IP filtering.

### Can I use Serverless Functions with Edge Services?

You cannot use Serverless Functions with Edge Services because there are no native integrations between the two products yet.

### Can I use the IP address of a Serverless Function?

By design, it is not possible to guarantee static IPs on Serverless Compute resources.

### How can I attach Block Storage to a Serverless Function?

Scaleway Serverless Functions do not currently support attaching Block Storage. These functions are designed to be
stateless, meaning they do not retain data between invocations. For persistent storage, we recommend using external
solutions like Scaleway Object Storage.

### How can I store data in my Serverless resource?

Serverless resources are by default [stateless](/serverless-functions/concepts/#stateless), local storage is ephemeral.

For some use cases, such as saving analysis results, exporting data etc., it can be important to save data. Serverless resources can be connected to other resources from the Scaleway ecosystem for this purpose:

#### Databases

* [Serverless Databases](/serverless-sql-databases/): Go full serverless and take the complexity out of PostgreSQL database operations.
* [Managed MySQL / PostgreSQL](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/): Ensure scalability of your infrastructure and storage with our new generation of Managed Databases designed to scale on-demand according to your needs.
* [Managed Database for Redis®](/managed-databases-for-redis/): Fully managed Redis®* in seconds.
* [Managed MongoDB®](/managed-mongodb-databases/): Get the best of MongoDB® and Scaleway in one database.

#### Storage

* [Object Storage](/object-storage/): Multi-AZ resilient object storage service ensuring high availability for your data.
* [Scaleway Glacier](/object-storage/): Our outstanding Cold Storage class to secure long-term object storage. Ideal for deep archived data.
