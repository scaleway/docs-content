The Easy Deploy feature allows you to pull images directly from [Scaleway Container Registry](/compute/container-registry/concepts#container-registry), instantly deploying containerized applications in your [Kubernetes Kapsule](/compute/kubernetes/concepts#kubernetes-kapsule) cluster.

**With only the basic options to set, you can use Kubernetes Kapsule without managing your `.yaml` manifests.**

## How to deploy a container 

<Message type="note">

To deploy a container from an image stored within Container Registry, you must be logged in to the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com/).

</Message>

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Compute** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Kubernetes Kapsule dashboard displays.

2. Click the name of the cluster you wish to deploy your image on. The Cluster Information tab displays.
  <Lightbox src="assets/scaleway-cluster-information.webp" alt="" />

3. Click the **Easy Deploy** tab.

4. Click **Deploy a container**. 

5. Enter a name for your container as well as the Kubernetes namespace on which the deployment will run. A default namespace is attributed if the value is not specified.

6. Select the namespace you would like to deploy from the Container Registry. Specify **Container** and **Tag**.

    <Message type="note">

    Your container needs to be public in order to be selected and deployed.

    </Message>

    You can configure the deployment of your clusters in two ways: **Deployments** or **CronJobs**.

    A **Deployment** represents a set of identical Pods with no individual identities, managed by a deployment controller. The deployment controller runs multiple replicas of an application as specified in a ReplicaSet. If any pods fail or become unresponsive, the deployment controller replaces them until the actual state equals the desired state. **By using a Deployment Kubernetes object, you do not need to manage your Pods nor your ReplicaSet.**

    You can set up a Load Balancer for your container, create several replicas and add environment variables, such as database host/credentials, for example. 

    **CronJobs** in Kubernetes work like traditional cron jobs in Linux. They can be used to run tasks at a specific time or interval and may be useful for jobs such as backups or cleanup tasks. You can edit your Deployments and CronJobs settings, but cannot modify the type of deployment nor the Container to deploy. If you need to do so, you will need to delete the existing deployment and create a new one accordingly.

    For cronjobs, an instruction schedule must be defined. Each Cron instruction is scheduled using the following syntax:
    ```
    Minute (mm): 0 - 59
    Hour (hh): 0 - 23
    Day of the Month (dd): 1 - 31
    Month (MMM): 1 - 12
    Day of the Week (DDD): 0 - 6 (Sunday to Saturday, 7 is also Sunday on some systems)
    ```
    Each instruction can also be:
    ```
    *: at each unit (1, 2, 3, 4...)
    5,8: at unit 5 and 8
    2-5: at unit 2 to 5
    */3: every 3 unit (0, 3, 6, 9...)
    10-20/3: every 3 units, between the tenth and the twentieth (10, 13, 16, 19)
    
    Example: 45 23 * * 6
    This example executes program at 23:45 (11:45 PM) every Saturday.
    ``` 
    You must also include a path to your script in the **Command** box and set-up environment variables. 

7. Select a deployment type and fill out the prompted information according to your choice. A summary of your choices is available.

8. Click **Deploy a Container** to proceed. A list of your containers displays. 

## How to edit a container

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Compute** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Kubernetes Kapsule dashboard displays.

2. Click <Icon name="edit" /> next to the container you wish to edit, then click **Edit** in the menu. A pop-up displays with the configuration options. 

3. Modify the container according to your requirements, then click **Update Container** to conclude.

<Message type="note">

The container **Type** cannot be modified. If you wish to use a different type, a new container must be created.

## How to delete a container

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Compute** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Kubernetes Kapsule dashboard displays.

2. Click <Icon name="edit" /> next to the container you want to delete, then click **Delete** in the pop-up menu. A message prompt displays to request confirmation.

3. To confirm the deletion of the deployment, click **Delete Deployment**.

<Message type="important">

Deleting a deployment is irreversible and all data related to the deployment will be deleted.
