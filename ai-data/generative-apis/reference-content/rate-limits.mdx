## What are the limits?

<Message type="important">
  This service has no rate limits while in closed beta. Limits will be set at a later stage.
</Message>

Any given model served through Scaleway Generative APIs will ultimately get limited by:
- Tokens per minute
- Queries per second

We welcome feedback from early testers to set proper rates according to future use.

## Why do we set rate limits?

These limits will safeguard against abuse or misuse of Scaleway Generative APIs, helping to ensure fair access to the API with consistent performance.
