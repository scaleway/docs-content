OpenVPN is an open-source software application that implements Virtual Private Network (VPN) techniques for creating secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote access facilities.

The OpenVPN InstantApp is a fast and simple way to protect your online privacy and surf anonymously.

OpenVPN InstantApp comes with:

- an OpenVPN server
- a client configuration profile to set up your client

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your SSH key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key)
  - You have installed a VPN client on your local machine

</Message>

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Instance creation page displays.

2. Click **Create an Instance**. The Instance creation wizard displays.

3. Choose the **NextCloud** image in the **InstantApps** tab:

4. Follow the remaining steps to [create your Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/).

## Create a VPN user

1. [Connect to your instance](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/) via SSH. The message of the day (MOTD) when you connect your server displays the `path` and the `url` to retrieve the VPN client file that we will use to connect to the VPN server.

  It's the first boot, we are crafting your keys,
  this is going to take a long time... ~30m since the boot

  Run this command to be notified when your service is ready:
  $ scw-ovpn status
  ```

2. Create a new user with the `scw-ovpn` tool.

  ```
  root@scw-942e6e:~# scw-ovpn
  This wrapper helps you manage your openvpn server.
  Use these commands to create an user and get a link to its configuration:
  $ scw-ovpn create MYUSER
  $ scw-ovpn serve MYUSER

  If you do not want to transfer your configuration over cleartext HTTP, type this command on your own machine:
  $ ssh root@51.15.51.220 scw-ovpn show MYUSER > MYUSER.ovpn

  You could also copy-paste the output of:
  $ scw-ovpn show MYUSER

  Or even use port forwarding to tunnel your requests to the port the http server listens on when running '$ scw-ovpn serve ...'.

  Choose the way you like and understand !

      $ scw-ovpn status
      shows the status of the initial openvpn configuration

      $ scw-ovpn create CLIENTNAME
      create a new certificate with name CLIENTNAME

      $ scw-ovpn list
      list all available and revoked clients in separate lists

      $ scw-ovpn revoke CLIENTNAME
      revoke the certificate for CLIENTNAME. This client will not be able to connect afterwards.

      $ scw-ovpn show CLIENTNAME
      shows the openvpn config file for client CLIENTNAME

      $ scw-ovpn serve CLIENTNAME
      starts an HTTP server you can download your openvpn client configuration from

      $ scw-ovpn add-instance PROTOCOL PORT ID
      add an openvpn instance listenning on PORT with PROTOCOL.
      protocol must be one of udp and tcp.

      $ scw-ovpn del-instance ID
      removes the openvpn instance with subnet id ID

      $ scw-ovpn list-instances
      list all running openvpn Instances
  ```

3. Run it with the following command:

  ```
  scw-ovpn create CLIENTNAME
  ```
  It will automatically generate the configuration for the client `CLIENTNAME`.

4. Download the configuration file from your server either via SSH or by starting a HTTP server that provides an `URL` to download the files directly on your computer.

  ```
  scw-ovpn serve CLIENTNAME
  ```

  ```
  root@scw-942e6e:~# scw-ovpn serve ovpn
  You can now download the openvpn client configuration at :

  > > http://51.15.51.220:4242/69a24160-0a77-11e8-b599-5b914f6cdb17/ovpn.ovpn
  > >
  > > > Press ENTER to stop serving the config file
  > > > Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 4242 ...
  > > >
  ```
5. Download the configuration file from the `URL` displayed in the MOTD. We assume that you have already installed a VPN client.

6. Open the configuration with your VPN client.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-tunnelblick03.webp" alt="" />

7. Start a new connection using the VPN profile we just installed once the configuration is loaded.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-tunnelblick04.webp" alt="" />

You are now connected and all your traffic is routed through the OpenVPN server. Check that your public IP matches the public IP of the server to ensure your configuration is correct.
