[Scaleway Container Registry](/containers/container-registry/concepts/#container-registry) is a fully-managed, mutualized container registry, designed to facilitate the storage, management, and deployment of container images. The service simplifies the development-to-production workflow, as there is no need to operate your own Container Registry or worry about the underlying infrastructure.

Within your Container Registry, [namespaces](/containers/container-registry/concepts/#namespace) allow you to manage your registry in a clear, simple and human-readable way. A namespace is a collection of container images, each bearing the unique identifier of that namespace. To start using your Container Registry, you first need to create a namespace.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization


1. Click **Container Registry** in the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. If you do not have a Registry already created, the product creation page is displayed.
2. Click **Create namespace** to launch the namespace creation wizard.
3. Enter the following required information for your namespace:
    * A **Name** for the namespace
    * A **Description** of the namespace
    * The geographical **Region** of the namespace
    * The namespace's **Privacy Policies**

    <Message type="note">
      A namespace can either be [public or private](/containers/container-registry/concepts/#namespace-privacy-policies). Anyone will be able to pull container images from a public namespace. Privacy policies may be set at image level.
    </Message>
4. Click **Create namespace** to create the namespace.
