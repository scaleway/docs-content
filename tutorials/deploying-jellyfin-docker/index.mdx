Jellyfin is an open-source media server that allows you to organize, stream, and manage your personal media collection.
It supports various clients and devices, providing a self-hosted alternative to commercial streaming services.
This tutorial explains how to deploy Jellyfin on a Scaleway Instance using Docker, which simplifies installation and management.
We will use an Ubuntu-based Instance and the official Jellyfin Docker container.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An [Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) running the latest Ubuntu image

## Connecting to the Instance

1. Open a terminal on your local machine.

2. Connect via SSH using the following command:

   ```
   ssh root@your_instance_ip
   ```

   Replace `your_instance_ip` with the actual IP. Accept the host key if prompted.

    <Message type="tip">
        If you are using a non-root user or a different key, adjust the command accordingly (e.g., `ssh -i /path/to/key ubuntu@your_instance_ip`).
    </Message>

## Installing Docker

1. Update the `apt` package cache and upgrade already installed packages to their latest version:

   ```
   apt update && apt upgrade -y
   ```

2. Install the prerequisites for adding the Docker repository:

   ```
   apt install ca-certificates curl -y
   ```

3. Add Docker's official GPG key:

   ```
   install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
   chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
   ```

4. Add the Docker repository to `apt` sources:

   ```
   echo \
     "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
     $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
     tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
   apt update
   ```

5. Install the required Docker packages:

   ```
   apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin acl -y
   ```

6. Verify that Docker is installed by running a test container:

   ```
   docker run hello-world
   ```

   This should download and run a simple image, confirming Docker works.

## Creating a Jellyfin user

1. Create a user named `jellyfin`:
    ```
    adduser jellyfin
    ```
    Enter the users' password, password confirmation, account information and confirm by pressing `Enter`.

2. Enter the `jellyfin` user:
    ```
    su jellyfin
    ```

3. Run the following command to get the user ID and group ID of the user.
    ```
    id -u && id -g
    ```
    This command outputs two numbers: the user ID (e.g. `1001`) and the group ID (e.g. `10001`). Save these numbers as you will need them for the following steps.

## Deploying Jellyfin

1. Create a directory for Jellyfin configuration and navigate to it:

   ```
   mkdir ~/jellyfin && cd ~/jellyfin
   ```

2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

   ```
   services:
     jellyfin:
       image: jellyfin/jellyfin
       container_name: jellyfin
       user: <USER ID>:<GROUP ID>
       network_mode: 'host'
       volumes:
         - ./config:/config
         - ./cache:/cache
         - /path/to/your/media:/media
       restart: 'unless-stopped'
       environment:
         - JELLYFIN_PublishedServerUrl=http://your_instance_ip:8096
   ```

   Customize the volumes: 
   - Replace `/path/to/your/media` with the actual path to your media files on the Instance. You can mount additional volumes if needed. 
   - Replace `your_instance_ip` with the public IP.
   - Replace `<USER ID>` and `<GROUP ID>` with the `jellyfin` user ID and group ID retrieved in the previous step.

    <Message type="note">
    Running as a non-root user is recommended; the `user` line specifies the ID of the `jellyfin` user. Ensure the mounted directories have appropriate permissions.
    Ensure the Jellyfin user has write and read permission to the `/config` and `/cache` folders by setting permissions: `setfacl -m u:jellyfin:rwx config` and `setfacl -m u:jellyfin:rwx cache`.
    </Message>

2. Start the Jellyfin container:

   ```
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   This pulls the image and runs it in detached mode.

## Accessing Jellyfin

1. Open a web browser on your local machine and navigate to `http://your_instance_ip:8096`, replacing `your_instance_ip` with the Instance's public IP.
2. Follow the on-screen setup wizard: 
- Create an admin account
- Add your media libraries, and 
- Configure settings like language and metadata.

<Message type="tip">
 Jellyfin listens on port `8096` by default. Ensure this port is open in your [Instance's security groups](/instances/how-to/use-security-groups/). For production, consider setting up HTTPS with a [reverse proxy like Nginx](/tutorials/nginx-reverse-proxy/).

By following these steps, you have a functional Jellyfin media server running on Scaleway. For more advanced configurations, refer to the official [Jellyfin documentation](https://jellyfin.org/docs/).
