Scaleway's Generative APIs service allows users to interact with powerful code models hosted on the platform.

Code models are inherently [language models](/ai-data/generative-apis/how-to/query-language-models/) specialized in **understanding code**, **generating code** and **fixing code**. 

As such, they will be available through the same interfaces as language models:
- The Scaleway [console](https://console.scaleway.com) provides complete [playground](/ai-data/generative-apis/how-to/query-language-models/#accessing-the-playground), aiming to test models, adapt parameters, and observe how these changes affect the output in real-time.
- Via the [Chat API](/ai-data/generative-apis/how-to/query-language-models/#querying-language-models-via-api)

For more information on how to query language models, read [our dedicated documentation](/ai-data/generative-apis/how-to/query-language-models/).

Code models are also ideal AI assistants when **added to IDEs** (integrated development environments). 

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) for API authentication
- An IDE such as Visual Studio Code or JetBrains

## Install Continue in your IDE

[Continue](https://www.continue.dev/) is an [open-source code assistant](https://github.com/continuedev/continue) to connect AI models to your IDE.

To get Continue, simply hit `install` in your IDE's marketplace:
- [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue)
- [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22707-continue)

## Configure Scaleway as an API provider in Continue

Continue's `config.json` file will set models and providers allowed for chat, autocompletion etc.
Here is an example configuration with Scaleway's OpenAI-compatible provider:

```json
"models": [
    {
      "model": "qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct",
      "title": "Qwen2.5-coder",
      "provider": "scaleway",
      "apiKey": "###SCW SECRET KEY###"
    }
]
```

<Message type="tip">
 The config.json file is typically stored as `~/.continue/config.json` on Linux/macOS systems, and `%USERPROFILE%\.continue\config.json` on Windows.

Read more about how to set up your `config.json` on the [official Continue documentation](https://docs.continue.dev/reference).
