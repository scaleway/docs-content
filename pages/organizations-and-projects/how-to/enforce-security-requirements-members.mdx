For the increased security of your Organization, you can enforce different security measures for your IAM members.

<Message type="important">
  The security measures listed on this page, except enforcing MFA, apply only to [IAM members](/iam/concepts#members).
</Message>

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)

## How to edit the grace period of your Organization

From their first login, members have a default grace period of seven days to comply with security requirements before their access to the Organization is automatically locked. You can extend or reduce the grace period in the console.

<Message type="important">
  Locked members cannot connect to the Organization until they are [manually unlocked](/iam/how-to/manage-members#how-to-unlock-a-member). Upon regaining access, the grace period resets, giving them another chance to meet security requirements.
</Message>

1. Click the **Security** tab of the [Organization Dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/organization).
2. Scroll to the **Grace period** section.
3. Click **Define grace period**. A pop-up displays.
4. Define the grace period in hours or days.
5. Click **Define grace period** to confirm.

## How to set a maximum number of login attempts

Currently, a default number of maximum 5 login attempts is set up for your Organization automatically.

## How to enforce MFA for a member
