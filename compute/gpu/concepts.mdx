  GPU Instances share many concepts in common with traditional Instances. See also the [Instances Concepts page](/compute/instances/concepts/) for more information.

## Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a platform as a service (PaaS) tool, that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Scaleway provides a number of pre-built Docker images, which allow you to [run a Docker container on your GPU Instance](/compute/gpu/how-to/use-gpu-with-docker/) and access a pre-installed Pipenv environment ideal for your AI projects.

## GPU

**G**raphical **P**rocessing **U**nit (GPU) became a go-to term for the specialized electronic circuits, designed to power graphics on a machine. The term was popularized in the late 1990s by the chip manufacturer NVIDIA. GPUs were originally produced primarily to drive high-quality gaming experiences, producing life-like digital graphics. Today, those capabilities are being harnessed more broadly for data processing, articificial intelligence, rendering and video encoding.

## Pipenv

Pipenv is a package and dependency manager for Python projects. It harnesses the power of different existing tools, bringing their functionalities together:

 - `pip` for Python package management
 - `pyenv` for Python version management
 - `Virtualenv` for creating different virtual Python environments
 - `Pipfile` for managing project dependencies

Pipenv is pre-installed on all of Scaleway's AI Docker images for GPU Instances, making it easy to [use virtual environments](/compute/gpu/how-to/use-pipenv/). Pipenv replaces Anaconda for this purpose.
