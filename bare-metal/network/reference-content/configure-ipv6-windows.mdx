  On servers supporting [IPv6 SLAAC](/bare-metal/network/reference-content/enable-ipv6-slaac), SLAAC has to be enabled in order to ensure that DHCPv6 works correctly.

## How to set the DUID in the Windows Registry

<Message type="important">
  Modifying values in the Windows Registry may cause damage to your installation. Be careful when editing these settings.
</Message>

1. Launch the **Registry Editor** by typing `regedit.exe` in the start menu:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_ipv6_regedit.webp" width="" />
2. Scroll down until you reach the following setting: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\services\TCPIP6\Parameters` and edit the value `Dhcpv6DUID` with the DUID of your block by double clicking on the default value:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_ipv6_regedit_edit.webp" width="" />

## How to configure IPv6 connectivity 

1. Go to your network settings, double-click on your Internet connection, open the connection details and enter the IPv6 settings. Set the IP of the machine to an IPv6 address of your subnet and the netmask:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_ipv6_config_win.webp" alt="" />
2. Once you have saved the configuration, open a terminal and test the connection by running a `ping -6 google.com` or `tracert -6 google.com`:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_ipv6_ping6_win.webp" alt="" />
