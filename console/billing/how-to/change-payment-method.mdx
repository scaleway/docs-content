If you have registered both a **credit card** and a **SEPA mandate**, you can choose the default payment method you wish to use for your Scaleway account.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid credit card added to your account, even if you have set up SEPA as the default payment method.


1. Click **Billing** in the Organization drop-down menu to go to the **Billing Overview** page.
