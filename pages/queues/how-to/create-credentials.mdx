This page shows how to create [credentials](/queues/concepts/#credentials) for Scaleway Queues. Credentials give their bearer (e.g. services and platforms) access to your messaging queue service. 

You can create multiple sets of credentials for Scaleway Queues. Credentials for Queues are granular: you can define the level of access that they should give. Credentials give the specified level of access to all queues that you create in the [region](/queues/concepts/#region) they are scoped to.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

1. Click **Queues** in the **Integration Services** section of the Scaleway console side menu. A list of your queues displays.

2. Click the **Credentials** tab.

3. Click **Generate credentials**. A pop-up displays:

    <Lightbox image={image} alt="In the Scaleway console, the Generate credentials screen displays. It prompts the user to choose a region for their credentials, a name, and permissions (write, read and/or manage)" />

4. Choose a region that these credentials should be scoped to.

5. Enter a name for these credentials.

6. Select the required permissions for the credentials. You must choose at least one of **Write**, **Read** and **Manage**. You are free to select any combination of these permissions.

7. Click **Generate credentials**.

    The credentials are created. The access key and secret key are displayed, and you are invited to copy them.
    
    <Message type="important">
      This is your only chance to view and save the secret key. Make sure that you copy it and save it somewhere securely.
    </Message>

8. Copy and save the credentials, before closing the window.

    You are returned to the **Credentials** tab. The name of your newly-generated credentials, along with the access key and access level are displayed.
