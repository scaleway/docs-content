This page shows how to create and manage SNS [subscriptions](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#topic) with Scaleway Messaging and Queuing. When you create a subscription to a [topic](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#topic), you are effectively signing up an endpoint to receive all messages published to that topic.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created a topic](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-topics/)
</Message>

## How to create a subscription

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of Messaging and Queuing protocols displays.

2. Use the dropdown menu to select the [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) of the topic you want to create a subscription for.

3. Click **SNS**, then navigate to the **Topics** tab and click the topic you want to create a subscription for.

4. Click **create subscription**. The subscription creation wizard displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-subscription.webp" alt="" />

5. Verify the parameters of the topic that you are creating a subscription for.

6. Choose a protocol, based on the type of endpoint or client you want to subscribe. The following protocols are available:
  - **HTTP**: A service or web server that can receive `HTTP POST` requests from SNS, via standard HTTP protocol.
  - **HTTPS**: A service or web server that can receive `HTTP POST` requests from SNS, via secure HTTP protocol.
  - **Serverless Functions and Containers**: A Scaleway Serverless [Function](/serverless/functions/quickstart/) or [Container](/serverless/containers/quickstart/) with a privacy policy set to **public**.

5. Enter a **name** for your topic. The name must contain no more than 80 characters, and consist only of alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. Alternatively, you can go with the auto-generated name suggested for you.

6. Choose a **topic type**. Currently only the **Standard** topic type is available, ensuring at-least-once delivery. See the [topic types](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#topic-types) documentation for more information. 

7. Click **Create topic** to finish.

You are returned to the **Topics** tab, where your newly-created topic now displays. The topic's URL is also displayed here, for use in your API/CLI operations. 

<Message type="tip">
Remember that you need to [create credentials](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-credentials/) in order to access your SNS service and its topics from an API or CLI. Sending messages to topics requires that credentials have the `can_publish` permission, while receiving messages from topics requires the `can_receive` permission. You can create separate credentials if you need to isolate these two roles in your application.
</Message>

## How to delete a topic

When you no longer want a topic, you can delete it. This action is irreversible and deletes the topic along with all its associated subscriptions.

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of Messaging and Queuing protocols displays.

2. Use the dropdown menu to select the [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) containing the topic you want to delete.

3. Click **SNS**, then navigate to the **Topics** tab, where the list of your topics in the pre-selected region displays.

4. Click the topic you wish to delete. The topic's **Settings** page displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-topic-settings.webp" alt="" />

5. Either:
    - Click the topic you wish to delete. The topic's **Settings** page displays. Click the **Delete topic** button in the bottom right corner.
    - Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the topic you wish to delete, then select **Delete** from the menu that displays.

    A pop-up asks you to confirm that you understand this action will delete the topic and all of its associated subscriptions.

6. Type **DELETE** and click **Delete topic**.
