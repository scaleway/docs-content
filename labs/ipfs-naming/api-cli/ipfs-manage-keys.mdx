## Export key using a Kubo client

To export your kubo client key and convert it to base64 for import into our naming service, you can use this sequence of commands.

1. Run the following CLI command to list the keys you own:

 ```
    ipfs key list
```

2. Run the following CLI command to export the key to a privkey.pem file:

 ```
  ipfs key export myKey -o privkey.pem
 ```

<Message type="important">
    The key must be exported in libp2p-protobuf-cleartext format, which is the default.
</Message>

3. Convert file contents to base64 for import into the naming service via the scw CLI.
    ```
     cat privkey.pem | base64
    ```
