To use a storage device in Linux it must be mounted (attached) to the operating system. Once it is mounted, a filesystem can be created on the device to store data. Similarly, to remove the device securely from the operating system, you should [unmount it](/storage/block/how-to/detach-a-volume) properly.

This document explains how to mount an additional block volume to your Instance. Note that the root volume of the Instance is mounted for you at the time of Instance creation, this how-to concerns additional block volumes only.

## How to verify device availability

1. Connect to your Instance with `ssh`.
    ```
    ssh root@<your_instance_ip>
    ```
2. Use the `lsblk` command to make sure your block volume is available:
    ```
    lsblk
    ```

  You should see an output like the following. You can see your block volume named `sda` with the chosen storage size.

  ```sh no-copy
  root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# lsblk
  NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
  sda       8:0    0 23.3G  0 disk
  vda     252:0    0 18.6G  0 disk
  ├─vda1  252:1    0 18.5G  0 part /
  └─vda15 252:15   0  100M  0 part /boot/efi
  ```

  The Scaleway ecosystem uses [GiB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibibyte) to define storage sizes and not [GB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte) as the default on linux.

## How to format the Block Volume

1. Create a file system with the following command. This command uses the `ext4` filesystem, though you can choose another if you prefer.
    ```
    mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda
    ```
2. Make sure your file system is correctly created by running the `lsblk -f` command.
    ```
    lsblk -f
    ```

  You should see an output like the following. Check that the `FSTYPE` field matches `ext4` for your Block volume.

  ```sh no-copy
  root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# lsblk -f
  NAME    FSTYPE LABEL UUID                                 MOUNTPOINT
  sda     ext4         925c2c17-ca8c-493a-a9cd-b475d87fd276
  vda
  ├─vda1  ext4   root  8509fe04-d91c-410a-9087-c5d34537d3ae /
  └─vda15 vfat         B3E7-7040                            /boot/efi
  ```

## How to mount the Block Volume

Once your file system is created, you need to mount it.

1. Create the mount point. In this tutorial, we choose `/mnt/block-volume`.
    ```
    mkdir /mnt/block-volume
    ```
2. Mount the volume. We recommend you use the `defaults` option, as in the command below.
    ```
    mount -o defaults /dev/sda /mnt/block-volume
    ```

  ```sh no-copy
       **defaults**
            Use  the  default  options: **rw**, **suid**, **dev**,
            **exec**, **auto**, **nouser**, and **async**.
  ```

  If you want to see all available options, you can run `man mount` on your instance.
3. Make sure your file system is properly mounted by running the `lsblk` command.
    ```
    lsblk
    ```

  You should see an output like the following. Check the `MOUNTPOINT` field.

  ```sh no-copy
  root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# lsblk
  NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
  sda       8:0    0 23.3G  0 disk /mnt/block-volume
  vda     252:0    0 18.6G  0 disk
  ├─vda1  252:1    0 18.5G  0 part /
  └─vda15 252:15   0  100M  0 part /boot/efi
  ```

## How to use fstab for Persistent Mounting

With the current configuration, the block device will not be mounted automatically upon reboot. Use the `fstab` file to make sure the reboot does not impact your file system.

Add this line to the `/etc/fstab` file of your instance:

```
echo "UUID=$(blkid --output value /dev/sda | head -n1) /mnt/block-volume ext4 defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
```

## How to transfer data from your local machine to the remote block volume

You may wish to transfer files from your local machine to your Instance's remote block volume. This can be simply achieved with [rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync), a tool for efficiently transferring and copying files. The rsync utility is pre-installed on most Linux distributions and macOS. 

1. Check that rsync is installed on your local machine with the following command:
    ```
    rsync --version
    ```

  You should see an output similar to the following:

    ```sh no-copy
    rsync  version 3.1.3  protocol version 31
  Copyright (C) 1996-2018 by Andrew Tridgell, Wayne Davison, and others.
  Web site: http://rsync.samba.org/
  Capabilities:
      64-bit files, 64-bit inums, 64-bit timestamps, 64-bit long ints,
      socketpairs, hardlinks, symlinks, IPv6, batchfiles, inplace,
      append, ACLs, xattrs, iconv, symtimes, prealloc

  ```

  <Message type="tip">
    If you get a `command not found` output (or similar), you need to install rsync. On Linux Ubuntu and Debian systems, you can do this with the APT package tool using the command `sudo apt install rsync`. For Linux CentOS/ Fedora, use the YUM package manager: `sudo yum install rsync`. On Mac OSX with the Homebrew package manager, use `brew install rsync`.

2. On your local machine, use nano create a file called `hello-world.txt`:
    ```
    nano hello-world.txt
    ```

  Enter the text `Hello World!`, then save and exit the file.
3. Enter the following command to transfer the file to your Instance's mounted block volume. Ensure that you use your own Instance's IP address:
    ```
    rsync -a hello-world-2.txt root@<your.IP.address.here>:/mnt/block-volume
    ```

The file is now transferred. You can connect to your Instance again, and use the command `cd /mnt/block-volume ; ls` to check that the file appears in the directory.
