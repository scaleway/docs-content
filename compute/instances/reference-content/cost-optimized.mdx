An Instance is a virtual machine in the cloud. Scaleway supports several [types of Instances](/compute/instances/reference-content/choosing-instance-type), each with their own set of resources, unique value propositions, and technical specifications. Each Instance supports the essential operating systems and distributions, as well as customized [Instantapps](/compute/instances/concepts/#instantapp).

## Development Instances and General Purpose Instances

Scaleway's **Cost-Optimized** range includes Development Instances and General Purpose Instances. These Instances provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources, and can be used for a wide range of workloads. For example, they are ideally suited for scaling a development and testing environment, but also Content Management Systems (CMS) or microservices. They are also a good default choice if you are not sure which Instance type is best for your application.

See below the technical specifications of Development Instances or General Purposes Instances:

| Range                         	| Cost-Optimized                                                              	|

## PLAY2 Instances and PRO2 Instances

In the same **Cost-Optimized** range, you will also find PLAY2 and PRO2 Instances. These are the next generation of Development and General Purpose Instances. They present the best price-performance ratio with the most flexible vCPU to RAM ratio, and provide features that target most standard and cloud-native workloads. In other words, these Instances keep costs down while still supporting a wide variety of cloud applications, such as medium-to-high-traffic web servers, medium-sized databases and e-commerce websites. 

See below the technical specifications of PLAY2 and PRO2 Instances:

| Range                         	| Cost-Optimized                                                              	|
