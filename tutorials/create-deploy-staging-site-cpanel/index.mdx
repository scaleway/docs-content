A staging website mirrors your production website, containing identical data and files while remaining publicly inaccessible.
Changes made on the staging website are isolated until being transferred to the production website after thorough checks from the design and development teams. Operating in the same environment as the production environment, it serves as an ideal testing ground.

Previously, setting up a staging website involved a convoluted and time-intensive process of data export, database creation, file copying, and configuration adjustment, followed by a reverse procedure for deployment.
This complexity discouraged many WordPress users from using staging websites, favoring live edits instead. However, for WordPress websites hosted on [Scaleway Web Hosting](https://www.scaleway.com/en/web-hosting/), powered by cPanel servers, the setup is simplified to just a few clicks.

Creating a staging website for your WordPress website is a smart move, allowing you to test changes before making them live. Use cases for staging websites include:
* Testing new landing pages.
* Developing or modifying themes.
* Implementing code changes to enhance functionality.
* Evaluating updates for compatibility issues.

8. You can add labels to distinguish staging websites from live ones. Click **Add Label** and choose an appropriate label from the drop-down menu. (This step is optional but recommended.)

Once the cloning process is complete, your staging website will be ready. You can access it through the main WP Toolkit interface alongside your other websites.
Use your staging website to test changes, such as new features, themes, or code edits. Ensure everything works as expected before proceeding.

## Deploying changes to production

After testing, it's time to push the changes to your main website.

1. Go to the staging website's WP Toolkit dashboard and click the **Copy Data** tool.

2. Select your production website from the drop-down menu in the **Copy Data** interface.
3. Choose which aspects of the website to transfer, including files, databases, and specific tables.
4. Choose whether to overwrite or delete production files affected by changes made on the staging website.
5. Click **Start** to proceed with the copying process.

 WP Toolkit automatically creates a restore point before copying data, providing a safety net if anything goes wrong during deployment.
