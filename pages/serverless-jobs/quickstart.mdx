Scaleway Serverless Jobs allows you to run recurring tasks in the cloud. A [Job](/serverless-jobs/concepts/#job) is based on a job definition, which is used as a template to create job runs.

<Message type="tip">
    For more details about advantages of using Serverless, [read the Serverless overview page](/serverless-jobs/reference-content/serverless-overview/).
</Message>

Jobs are designed for autonomous and recurring tasks, and therefore do not offer automatic scaling or a web interface.

Refer to the [differences between Jobs, Containers, and Functions](/serverless-jobs/reference-content/difference-jobs-functions-containers/) for more information on Scaleway's different Serverless products.

This page explains how to create a job definition with the latest Alpine Linux image, how to execute it, and delete it.

## Console overview
Discover the Serverless Jobs interface in the Scaleway console.
