Scaleway's Serverless Jobs allow you to run recurring tasks in the cloud. A [Job](/serverless/jobs/concepts/#job) is composed of a job definition which is used as a template to create job runs.

This page explains how to create a job definition with the latest Alpine Linux image, how to execute it and delete it.

## How to create a job definition

To keep this quickstart simple, we will create a job from an external registry. To create a job from the Scaleway Container Registry, refer to [this documentation](/serverless/jobs/how-to/create-job-from-scaleway-registry).

1. Click **Jobs** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The Jobs page displays.

2. Click **+ Create job**.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Select the **External** container registry.
    - Enter `docker.io/library/alpine:latest` in the image URL field.
    - Enter a **name** or use the automatically generated one. The name can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes.
    - Enter a **description** (optional).
    - Select the region in which your job will be created.
    - Choose the smallest **resources** available to allocate to your job.
    - Set the following starup command in the **Advanced options**:
        ```
        echo "Hello world!"
        ```
