With Block Storage it is possible to expand the volume size of an Instance.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />
 
<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
  - You have [created](/storage/block/how-to/create-a-volume/) a Block Storage volume
</Message>

## How to increase the volume size from the Scaleway console

1. Click the **Volumes** tab on the Instance information page of the console. A list of your volumes displays.
    <Message type="tip">
      You must go to the [Volumes tab](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/volumes) in the Scaleway console and select the volume corresponding to the Instance you want to increase.
    </Message>
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> beside the volume you want to increase and then click **Increase Volume**.
3. Increase the size according to your preference with the <Icon name="plus" /> button.

4. Click **Increase volume** to confirm.
    <Message type="note">
      Currently, only the **increase** of a Block Storage volume is supported. The maximum size of a Block volume is 10 TB.

## How to increase the partition size of the volume

<Message type="tip">
  It is recommended to make a backup of your data using the [snapshot](/compute/instances/how-to/create-a-snapshot/) feature, before increasing the partition size of your volume. This helps to avoid any potential data loss.
</Message>


1. Connect to your Instance using [SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).
2. Use the `lsblk` command to identify your Block Storage volume's mount point. In the following example the volume is mounted at `/mnt/block-volume`:
    ```
    root@scw-distracted-keldysh:~# lsblk
    NAME    MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
    loop0     7:0    0  63.3M  1 loop /snap/core20/1852
    loop1     7:1    0 111.9M  1 loop /snap/lxd/24322
    loop2     7:2    0  49.8M  1 loop /snap/snapd/18596
    sda       8:0    0   9.3G  0 disk
    ├─sda1    8:1    0   9.2G  0 part /
    ├─sda14   8:14   0     4M  0 part
    └─sda15   8:15   0   106M  0 part /boot/efi
    ```

3. Use `growpart` to increase the partition size of your block storage volume (here `/dev/sdb1`):
    ```
    growpart /dev/sdX 1
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      Take a note of the space between the device identifier and the partition number. 
    </Message>
4. Increase the partition size of the volume using `resize2fs`. Replace `/dev/sdX` with the name of your block volume in the following command:
    ```
    resize2fs -p /dev/sdX1
    ```
5. Check the new block volume size using `lsblk`:
    ```
    root@scw-distracted-keldysh:~# lsblk
    NAME    MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
    loop0     7:0    0  63.3M  1 loop /snap/core20/1852
    loop1     7:1    0 111.9M  1 loop /snap/lxd/24322
    loop2     7:2    0  49.8M  1 loop /snap/snapd/18596
    sda       8:0    0  18.6G  0 disk
    ├─sda1    8:1    0  18.5G  0 part /
    ├─sda14   8:14   0     4M  0 part
    └─sda15   8:15   0   106M  0 part /boot/efi
    ```
