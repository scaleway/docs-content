SSL offloading describes a pattern where the Load Balancer terminates encrypted connections at the frontend (decrypting incoming traffic), with the intention to forward it unencrypted to the backend servers. This effectively “offloads” the work of decrypting traffic from the backend server to the Load Balancer.

You can read more about SSL offloading, compared to SSL bridging or passthrough, in our [dedicated documentation](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/ssl-bridging-offloading-passthrough/)

This page shows you how to create a Load Balancer configured for SSL offloading using the [Load Balancer API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/load-balancer/zoned-api/).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## Setting up your environment

Before configuring the Load Balancer from the API, prepare your environment to facilitate usage of the API.

- Ensure you have [generated an API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/), and that you have the secret key to hand.
- Get your [Project](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project) ID from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/).
- Decide the [Availability Zone](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/load-balancer/zoned-api/#technical-information) for your Load Balancer.

Set these elements as environment variables as follows:

```json
export SCW_SECRET_KEY="<YOUR SECRET KEY>"
export SCW_DEFAULT_ZONE="<YOUR AVAILABILITY ZONE>"
export SCW_PROJECT_ID="<YOUR PROJECT ID>"
```

## Creating the Load Balancer

1. Create a new Load Balancer by running the following API call. Customize the `name`, `description` and `tags`:

    ```
    curl -X POST \
      -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      "https://api.scaleway.com/lb/v1/zones/$SCW_DEFAULT_ZONE/lbs" \
      -d '{
        "name":"API Test LB",
        "description": "my new Load Balancer",
        "project_id":"'"$SCW_PROJECT_ID"'",
        "tags":["test","another tag"]
      }'
    ```

    The output of the API call returns a `json` output, similar to the example below where:
      - The first line starting with `id` displays the ID of the newly-created Load Balancer.
      - The line starting with `ip_address` displays the Load Balancer's IP address.

    ```json no-copy
      {
      "id":"625f3892-13ex-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "name":"API Test LB",
      "description":"my new Load Balancer",
      "status":"to_create",
      "instances":[
          
      ],
      "organization_id":"2ea18278-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "project_id":"2ea18278-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "ip":[
          {
            "id":"8802d6eb-abb6-4f35-a4f7-685182be39ab",
            "ip_address":"195.154.72.139",
            "organization_id":"2ea18278-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
            "project_id":"2ea18278-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
            "lb_id":"625f3892-13ex-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxx",
            "reverse":"195-154-72-139.lb.fr-par.scw.cloud",
            "tags":[
                
            ],
            "region":"fr-par",
            "zone":"fr-par-1"
          }
      ],
      "tags":[
          "test",
          "another tag"
      ],
      "frontend_count":0,
      "backend_count":0,
      "type":"lb-s",
      "subscriber":null,
      "ssl_compatibility_level":"ssl_compatibility_level_intermediate",
      "created_at":"2024-05-28T08:52:54.473341297Z",
      "updated_at":"2024-05-28T08:52:54.473341297Z",
      "private_network_count":0,
      "route_count":0,
      "region":"fr-par",
      "zone":"fr-par-1"
    }
    ```

2. Copy the `id` field of the response. Save this ID to a variable to use in the next steps.
	
    ```json
    export LOAD_BALANCER_ID="<YOUR LOAD BALANCER ID>"
    ```

## Creating a backend

This tutorial supposes that a web application is running on port `80` of the backend machines. 

1. Create a new backend for your Load Balancer. Make sure to replace `<YOUR FIRST SERVER IP>` and `<YOUR SECOND SERVER IP>` with the IPs of your backend servers:

    ```json
    curl -X POST \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
      "https://api.scaleway.com/lb/v1/zones/$SCW_DEFAULT_ZONE/lbs/$LOAD_BALANCER_ID/backends" \
      -d '{
        "name":"main backend",
        "forward_port": 80,
        "forward_port_algorithm": "roundrobin",
        "forward_protocol": "tcp",
        "health_check":{
            "check_delay": 2000,
            "check_max_retries": 3,
            "check_timeout": 1000,
            "port": 80,
            "tcp_config":{}
        }, 
        "server_ip": ["<YOUR FIRST SERVER IP>", "<YOUR SECOND SERVER IP>"]
      }'
    ```

    A `json` output similar to the first request displays. 

2. Copy the value of the first line of the output, starting with `id`. This is the ID of your Load Balancer's backend. Set it as a variable:

    ```json
    export BACKEND_ID="<YOUR BACKEND ID>"
    ```

## Creating an SSL/TLS certificate

In order to achieve SSL offloading, your Load Balancer needs an [SSL/TLS certificate](/network/load-balancer/concepts/#certificate). In these steps, we create a Let's Encrypt certificate, which we will then add to the Load Balancer's frontend.

1. Create a new certificate for your Load Balancer. Replace `<YOUR CERTIFICATE NAME>` with a friendly name for the certificate, and `<YOUR DOMAIN NAME>` with your domain name (this domain must exist and resolve to your Load Balancer IP address).

    ```json
    curl -X POST \
      -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      "https://api.scaleway.com/lb/v1/zones/$SCW_DEFAULT_ZONE/lbs/$LOAD_BALANCER_ID/certificates" \
      -d '{
        "name":"<YOUR CERTIFICATE NAME>",
        "letsencrypt":{
          "common_name":"<YOUR DOMAIN NAME>"
        }
      }'
    ```

    The certificate details are returned in the form of a `json` list. 

2. Copy the value of the first line of the output, starting with `id`. This is the ID of your Load Balancer's certificate. Set it as a variable:

	```json
	export CERTIFICATE_ID="<YOUR CERTIFICATE ID>"
	```

## Creating a frontend

1. Create a frontend for your Load Balancer by specifying the Load Balancer ID, backend ID and certificate ID. In the example below, we define the `inbound_port` as `443` (the default `HTTPS` port). The frontend will listen on this port for incoming connections.

    ```json 
    curl -X POST \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
      "https://api.scaleway.com/lb/v1/zones/$SCW_DEFAULT_ZONE/lbs/$LOAD_BALANCER_ID/frontends" \
      -d '{
        "name": "my frontend",
        "backend_id": "'"$BACKEND_ID"'",
        "inbound_port": 443,
        "timeout_client": 5000,
        "certificate_id": "'"$CERTIFICATE_ID"'"
      }'
    ```

    The frontend details are returned in `json` format.

## Conclusion

The Load Balancer is now up, configured with a [Let's Encrypt SSL/TLS certificate](https://letsencrypt.org/), accepting `HTTPS` connections on port `443` and terminating the `HTTPS` sessions on the Load Balancer before connecting to the backends via a plain `HTTP` connection.

For more information about the configuration of a Load Balancer via the API, refer to the [API documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/load-balancer/zoned-api/#introduction).
