When you [create a Scaleway account](/console/account/how-to/create-an-account/), an Organization, of which you are the [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner), is created for you.

An Organization is made of one or several [Projects](#project) that contain your resources.

## How to invite users to your Organization

You can invite other people to join your Organization: they will create their own Scaleway account (if they do not already have one) and then become [IAM users](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#user) of your Organization.

Refer to the [How to invite another user to an Organization](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/invite-user-to-orga/) documentation page for more information.

You can also invite people to be IAM users of an Organization in which you are not the Owner, if you have sufficient permissions (via policies) to do so. See our documentation on [permission sets](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/) for more information.

You can define the rights and permissions you want guests to have in your Organization via [policies](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#policy).

## How to accept an invitation to an Organization

If you were invited to join an Organization, you can refer to the [How to accept an invitation to an Organization](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/accept-invitation-to-orga/) documentation page for more information.
