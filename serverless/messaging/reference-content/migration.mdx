## Overview

Soon, a new version of Messaging and Queuing will be released. In this version, the concept of **namespaces** will be removed, to streamline your workflows and simplify your management of your Messaging and Queuing resources.

The release of this new version in the Scaleway console will coincide with the [NATS](TODO) and [SQS](TODO) protocols leaving [Public Beta](https://www.scaleway.com/en/betas/) and going into General Availability (GA) This means that the Messaging and Queuing product, when used with these protocols, will become billable. [SNS](TODO) will remain in Public Beta for now while we continue testing and improving the product.

Your NATS resources will automatically be migrated to the new version of the product. However, for SQS and SNS you will need to migrate, by recreating your resources in the new version. You can do this via the API or the console. If you do not migrate within the 30 days after the new version is released, we will automatically migrate your resources for you as the old version of the product will be deprecated and no longer accessible.

Read on to find out more about the new no-namespace version of the product, and how migration will work for the protocols you use.

## The current situation: v1alpha1 and namespaces

Whether you create and manage your NATS, or SQS/SNS namespaces and credentials via our [API](TODO) and [console](TODO), they both point towards the same underlying version of the product: `v1alpha1`, which holds your resources.

In this version of the product, you create one or multiple **namespaces**, setting the **protocol** for each namespace as either **NATS** or **SQS/SNS**. Each namespace gives you a **URL** (or endpoint) representing a Messaging and Queuing broker, and also allows you to create **credentials** to access that particular namespace. When you create messages, queues, streams, topics and other resources, they are scoped to that namespace.

## What's going to change: v1beta1 and no more namespaces

Soon, `v1alpha1` will be deprecated, and `v1beta1` will go into production, representing the new and improved Messaging and Queuing product.

In this new version of the product, the concept of namespaces has been removed. 





See the table below for an overview of the process.

| Protocol | Pre-GA | From time of GA | 30 days after GA |
|----------| ------ |-----------------|------------------|
| SQS      | Current version of API (with namespaces) available <br /> <br /> Current version of console (with namespaces) available <br /> <br /> Product is not billed, as in Public Beta | Current version of API (with namespaces) still available, but you must <br />
| SNS      |
| NATS     |




| Resource                                       | Criteria   | Limits   | Scope        |
|------------------------------------------------|------------|----------|--------------|
| Namespace                                      | Max number | 10       | Organization |
| NATS message payload                           | Max size   | 1 MB     | Message      |
| SQS/SNS message payload                        | Max size   | 256 KB   | Message      |
| SQS queue storage                              | Max size   | 100 MB   | Namespace    |
| NATS queue/stream storage                      | Max size   | 300 MB** | Namespace    |
| Max number of NATS/SQS queues                  | Max number | 10       | Namespace    |
| Max number of NATS consumers or SNS subscribers | Max number | 50      | Namespace    |
| Message age (SQS)                              | Max        | 14 days  | Message      |

**This implies stream replication. If you choose to replicate your stream across all nodes (3), a storage limit of 100 MB applies.

These limits are enforced as [Organization quotas](/console/my-account/reference-content/organization-quotas/).
