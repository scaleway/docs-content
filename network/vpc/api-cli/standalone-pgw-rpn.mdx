Scaleway Private Networks can be attached to [Public Gateways](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#public-gateway). Previously, Public Gateways could provide a DHCP service to Private Networks, assigning private IP addresses to attached resources. When [VPC went into General Availability](/network/vpc/reference-content/vpc-migration/) (GA), DHCP was moved from Public Gateways to be directly built into Private Networks and integrated with Scaleway's internal [IPAM](/network/vpc/concepts/#ipam). Public Gateways continue to act as gateways providing ingress/egress to the public Internet, as well as NAT and SSH bastion features. <br /><br />

This page has been preserved in the short term as legacy content, showing how you could previously **manually** configure a standalone Public Gateway (managing only ingress/egress without DHCP) via the [Scaleway CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli).
</Message>

As an overview: IPAM prevents the booking of four specific IPs in a subnet. For example, in the case of a regional Private Network with the subnet `192.168.1.0/24`, the following IP addresses are reserved and cannot be assigned to resources:

- 192.168.1.0 (network address)
- **192.168.1.1**
- 192.168.1.254
- 192.168.1.255 (broadcast address)

In this case, we can attach a Public Gateway with no DHCP to a regional Private Network with the static address `192.168.1.1`. Every Instance in the Private Network can then be manually configured with a default route to `192.168.1.1`.

In the steps below, we show how to **manually** configure a standalone Public Gateway via the [Scaleway CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli) and set up IPAM to assign IP addresses to resources in the network.

This solution intended for testing purposes, given that VPC and regional Private Networks are currently in [Public Beta](https://www.scaleway.com/en/betas/).

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created an API key](/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key/)
  - You have [installed the Scaleway CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli), and it is up to date
</Message>

1. [Create a regional Private Network](/network/vpc/how-to/create-private-network/) and [attach at least two Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/network/vpc/how-to/attach-resources-to-pn/) to it.

2. [Fill out the form](https://scaleway.typeform.com/to/EmElSxRE) to ask us to enable DHCP on your regional Private Network. State your the ID of your regional Private Network in your email (this ID is displayed in the regional Private Network's **Overview** page in the Scaleway console).

3. Retrieve the subnet of your regional Private Network:

    ```bash
    $ export PN_ID="your-regional-private-network-id"
    
    $ scw vpc private-network get $PN_ID
    # Irrelevant output redacted
    Subnets.0       172.16.12.0/22
    
    # The IPv4 subnet of your regional PN is: 172.16.12.0/22
    # The IP of your Public Gateway will be: 172.16.12.1/22
    
    $ export PGW_ADDR="172.16.12.1"
    $ export PGW_NET_ADDR="$PGW_ADDR/22"
    ```

4. Create a Public Gateway and attach it to the regional Private Network:

    ```bash
    $ export PROJECT_ID="scaleway-project-id"
    $ scw vpc-gw gateway create project-id=$PROJECT_ID enable-bastion=true
    # Irrelevant output redacted
    ID                 your-pgw-id
    
    # Retrieve the ID of your PGW in the output
    $ export PGW_ID="your-pgw-id"
    
    $ scw vpc-gw gateway-network create enable-masquerade=true enable-dhcp=false gateway-id=$PGW_ID private-network-id=$PN_ID address=$PGW_NET_ADDR
    ```
    
    <Message type="important">
    Ensure that you do **not** enable DHCP on the Public Gateway, as it will interfere with the manual configuration we are creating.

5. Connect to your Instance in your regional Private Network and look for your Private Network interface:

    ```bash
    $ ssh root@1.2.3.4
    $ ip addr show
    # Some information has been removed from the output to ease readability
    # Your PN interface is the one configured with an IP in your subnet (172.16.12.0/22)
    # In this case, it is ens4 as one of its IP is: 172.16.12.2/22

          valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    $ export PN_IFACE=ens4
    ```

6. Configure your Instance to add a default route to your Public Gateway on your Private Network interface. Choose the relevant set of instructions depending on your distribution:
