The logging Kickstart provides a database and a dashboard to store and visualize log messages transmitted through your IoT Hub.

It will setup and configure the following software on a Scaleway Instance:
- [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/): a document database tailored for log storage
- [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana): a powerful log visualization dashboard
- Bridge: a very simple, Scaleway-made, MQTT client to store messages in ElasticSearch

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have [created an IoT Hub](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/create-hub)
- You have [installed `mosquitto`](https://mosquitto.org/download/) on your local computer

</Message>

## How to create the Logging Kickstart 

1. Create a new [logging purpose Kickstart](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/create-kickstart) from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/iot-hub/kickstarts/create).

2. Select the IoT Hub and device to use with the Kickstart.
  <Message type="important">

  Currently only devices supporting insecure connections are allowed for this IoT Kickstart.

  </Message>

3. Choose the geographical region to deploy your Kickstart. 

4. Set a password for the Kickstart's dashboard. 

5. Click **Create a Kickstart** to launch the installation of the software stack. 

<Message type="note">

The kickstart setup process will insert a first log item in the database to make sure it is up and running.

## How to use the Logging Kickstart 

The bridge will connect to your IoT Hub and subscribe to `#` (all topics, more information about MQTT topics [here](https://blog.scaleway.com/scaleway-iot-hub-introduction-to-mqtt-topics/). 
Any valid message published on your IoT Hub will be stored as a document in the ElasticSearch database.

If the message payload is a UTF-8 encoded string, there are 3 possibilities:
- payload is a **number**: this number will show up in a `value` field of the document
- payload is a **JSON encoded string**: the first order JSON fields will be stored in the document
- payload is **any other string**: this string will show up in a `payload` field of the document
The bridge also adds a `topic` and a `timestamp` field to any document.

1. Click **IoT Hub** in the **IoT Station** section of the side menu. The list of your IoT Hubs displays.

2. Click the name of the IoT Hub you want to configure. The hub's overview page displays.

3. Click **Devices** to display the configuration of the device.

4. Click **Add devices** in the devices tab. The **Create a Device** wizard displays.

5. Enter a name for the device and allow insecure connections.

6. Click **Add a Device to your Hub**. The details of the device display. Take a note of the **Device ID**:

7. Open a terminal window on your local computer and type the following command:
    ```
    mosquitto_pub -h iot.fr-par.scw.cloud -i <device id> -t home/bedroom/temperature -m 19.4
    ```
    <Message type="note">

    The Endpoint `iot-fr-par.scw.cloud` may vary, you find your endpoint on the Hub's network page.

    </Message>

    The command above contains the following elements:
    - `-h`: The **endpoint** or host of your IoT Hub. You require it to communiciate with your hub.
    - `-i`: The **device ID** of your device. You can retrieve it from the **Devices** section of your hub. 
    - `-t`: The **thread** to send your meesage to. 
    - `-m`: The **message** containing the information you want to transmit.

8. Open a web browser and go to your Kickstarts dashboard (Kibana) available at `http://<your_kickstart_instance_ip>`. Login using the user **admin** and the password set during the Kickstart creation. 

9. Click <Icon name="more" />, then **Discover**. The discover page displays. You should see an item matching the message you just sent.
