PostgreSQL is a different DBMS, like MySQL, allowing the management of data. It is released under a BSD license and maintained by a community and not by a company.
It is well known for its stability, considered as “near Oracle” and its high respect for SQL standards.

Compared with MySQL, PostgreSQL has the following advantages:

* Better compliance with SQL standards
* Stricter data integrity
* More native data types
* Much more customizable/extensible (define custom data types and functions)
* More advanced support of transactions, stored procedures, triggers and views
* Asynchronous notifications and treatments
* Better scalability

However, it has the following limitations:

* More complex to understand
* Replication is harder to implement
* Generally less well supported than MySQL in current projects (CMS, for example)
