## Listing all volumes and snapshots created in a specific Availability Zone

The Scaleway Instance and Block Storage APIs identify their volumes differently. Volumes created with the Instance API are identified as `b_ssd` volumes, whereas volumes created with the Block Storage API are identified as `sbs_5k` or `sbs_15k` volumes.

### Listing volumes created with the Instance API

Open a terminal and run the following command to list your volumes managed by the Instance API. Make sure that you replace `{zone}` with the desired Availability Zone.

    ```bash
    curl -X GET \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
    "https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/{zone}/volumes"
    ```
Below is an example of the output that should display if you have created volumes in the `fr-par-1` Availability Zone using the Instance API. Note that the `volume_type` field is set to `b_ssd`, meaning the volumes were created via the Instance API.

```

    }
  ]
}
```

### Listing volumes created with the Block Storage API

Open a terminal and run the following command to list your volumes managed by the Block Storage API. Make sure that you replace `{zone}` with the desired Availability Zone.

```bash
  curl -X GET \
  -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
  "https://api.scaleway.com/block/v1alpha1/zones/{zone}/volumes"
```

Below is an example of the output that should display if you have created volumes in the `fr-par-1` Availability Zone using the Block Storage API. Note that the `volume_type` field is set to either `sbs_15k` or `sbs_5k`,  meaning the volumes were created via the Block Storage API.

```
{
  "volumes": [
    {
      "id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "name": "volume-nifty-allen",
      "type": "sbs_15k",
      "size": 25000000000,

```

### Using the Block Storage API

Open a terminal and run the following command to list all snapshots created via the Block Storage API. Make sure that you replace `{zone}` with the desired Availability Zone.

```bash
  curl -X GET \
  -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \

## Identifying the API managing volumes with the CLI

### Using the Scaleway Instance CLI

1. Open your terminal and run the following command to list all your volumes.

    ```bash
    scw instance volume list
    ```
    An output similar to the following whould display:
    ```
    ID                                    STATE      SERVER ID

    ```
2. Note the ID of the volume you want to check the type of.
3. Get more information about your volume, including its type. Make sure that you replace `<volume-id>` with the ID of the volume.
    ```bash
    scw instance volume get <volume-id>
    ```
    An output similar to the following should display:
    ```
    Volume.ID                7c232b97-63da-46e3-a018-399e1690b14b
    Volume.Name              System volume
    Volume.Size              10 GB
    Volume.VolumeType        b_ssd

    Volume.State             available
    Volume.Zone              fr-par-1
    ```
4. Check the `Volume.VolumeType` field to learn if your volume is managed by the Instance API or the Block Storage API. Note that in our example, the `Volume.VolumeType` field displays `b_ssd`, meaning our volume is managed by the Instance API.

### Using the Scaleway Block Storage CLI

Open your terminal and run the following command to list all your volumes.
    ```bash
    scw block volume list
    ```
An output similar to the following should display:
    ```
    ID                                    NAME                          TYPE     SIZE

    ```

    Note that the `TYPE` field displays `sbs-15k` or `sbs_5k`, meaning our volumes are managed by the Block Storage API.

## Identifying the API managing snapshots with the CLI

### Using the Scaleway Instance CLI

1. Open a terminal and run the following command to list your snapshots:

    ```bash
    scw instance snapshot list
    ```
    An output similar to the following should display:
    ```
    ID                                    NAME                   ORGANIZATION
    d4b45594-7398-481d-8299-46292e07e404  snap-magical-driscoll  0c514155-9e5e-41a2-a900-9fdf0195b563
    ```
2. Note the ID of the snapshot you want to check the type of.
3. Get more information about your snapshot, including its type. Make sure that you replace `<snapshot-id>` with the ID of the snapshot.
    ```bash
    scw instance snapshot get <snapshot-id>
    ```
    An output similar to the following displays:
    ```
    Snapshot.ID                d4b45594-7398-481d-8299-46292e07e404
    Snapshot.Name              snap-magical-driscoll
    Snapshot.Organization      0c514155-9e5e-41a2-a900-9fdf0195b563
    Snapshot.Project           0c514155-9e5e-41a2-a900-9fdf0195b563
    Snapshot.VolumeType        b_ssd
    Snapshot.Size              25 GB
    Snapshot.State             available
    Snapshot.CreationDate      10 months ago
    Snapshot.ModificationDate  10 months ago
    Snapshot.Zone              fr-par-1
    ```
4. Check the `Snapshot.VolumeType` field to see the type of the snapshot. Note that in the example above, the `Snapshot.VolumeType` field displays `b_ssd`, meaning our volume is managed by the Instance API.

### Using the Scaleway Block Storage CLI

1. Open a terminal and run the following command to list your snapshots:

    ```bash
    scw block snapshot list
    ```
    An output similar to the following should display.

    ```
    ID                                    NAME                  SIZE   PROJECT ID

    ```
2. Note the ID of the snapshot you want to check the type of.
3. Get more information about your snapshot, including its type. Make sure that you replace `<snapshot-id>` with the ID of the snapshot.
    ```bash
    scw block snapshot get <snapshot-id>
    ```
    An output similar to the following should display:
    ```
    ID                   92fa0096-30cf-4e7e-a1fe-2fbe73f524b9
