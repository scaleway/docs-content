This page shows how to connect to your Scaleway Instance from the Scaleway console using the serial console (TTY, from **T**ele**TY**pewriter). It provides a way to connect to your Instance for debugging, or if it loses its network connectivity. The serial console remains available even if you can not reach your Instance over the internet.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An [Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/)
- A password for your Linux user

  You have to connect to your Instance using [SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/) and define a user password before connecting to your Instance using the serial console.

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The [Instances page](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers/) displays.
2. Click the Instance you want to connect to.
3. Click **Console** on the Instance **Overview** page. The serial console (TTY) displays in a pop-up.
