[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an Infrastructure as Code (IAC) software environment tool that allows you to easily build and maintain your cloud resources. You can use it to safely and efficiently deploy Scaleway resources in a declarative way.

Check out the [Scaleway Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/scaleway/scaleway/latest/docs) documentation for more information.

## Creating and Deploying Scaleway resources using Terraform

For the sake of this example, we are going to create a Kubernetes Kapsule cluster 

### Creating the Terraform configuration file

1. Create a new file called `main.tf` in a new folder. 

2. Open the file in a code editor and paste the following block to define Scaleway as the provider for this deployment:
    ```
    terraform {
      required_providers {
        scaleway = {
          source = "scaleway/scaleway"
        }
      }
      required_version = ">= 0.13"
    }
    ```
3. Add the following block and replace the placeholder with your project ID to determine in which project the resources are created:
    ```
    variable "project_id" {
      type        = string
      description = "<PROJECT_ID>"
    }
    ```
4. Add the following blocks to create a Private Network, a Kubernetes cluster and its associated pool:
    ```
    resource "scaleway_vpc_private_network" "my-pn" {
      name = "my-private-network"
    }

    resource "scaleway_k8s_cluster" "my-cluster" {
      name    = "my-cluster"
      type    = "kapsule"
      version = "1.28.2"
      cni     = "cilium"
      private_network_id = scaleway_vpc_private_network.my-pn.id
      delete_additional_resources = false
    }

    resource "scaleway_k8s_pool" "my-pool" {
      cluster_id  = scaleway_k8s_cluster.my-cluster.id
      name        = "my-pool"
      node_type   = "DEV1-M"
      size        = 1
      min_size    = 0
      max_size    = 1
      autoscaling = true
      autohealing = true
    }
    ```

    Refer to the [Terraform provider for Scaleway](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/scaleway/scaleway/latest/docs) to deploy other Scaleway resources.

5. Save your changes.

Your configuration is now ready to be deployed on Scaleway's infrastructure.

### Deploying your configuration using Terraform

1. Run the following command to initialize Terraform in the folder:
    ```
    terraform init
    ```
2. Run the following command to display the actions that Terraform will perform:
    ```
    terraform plan
    ```
3. Review the deployment plan to make sure it matches your configuration.
4. Run the following command to deploy your resources:
    ```
    terraform apply
    ```

Once the deployment is complete, log in to the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) to see the resources you just created.

## Deleting Scaleway resources using Terraform

Run the command below in the folder containing your Terraform configuration file to delete the corresponding resources.
  ```
  terraform destroy
  ```

<Message type="important">
You can only delete resources created with terraform and that are described in the configuration file.
