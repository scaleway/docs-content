  You are asked to select between three account levels:
  
    - **Discover:** allows you to browse through the Scaleway console and discover the catalog without ordering.
    - **Test:** allows you to order a few resources and test them before starting development or production.
    - **Build:** allows you to order any type of resources and scale your project as it grows.
