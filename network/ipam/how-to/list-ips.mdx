**IP** **A**ddress **M**anager (IPAM) is Scaleway's tool for planning, tracking and managing the IP address space of Scaleway products. It acts as a single source of truth for the IP addresses of Scaleway resources.

Read more about IPAM and future planned functionality on our [IPAM concepts page](/network/ipam/concepts/).

You can currently use IPAM to list the [private IP addresses](/network/ipam/concepts/#private-ip-address) of all your Scaleway resources attached to Private Networks.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- At least one resource [attached to a Private Network](/network/vpc/how-to/attach-resources-to-pn/).

## How to list and filter your private IP addresses

1. Click **IPAM** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu.

    A list of your **private IP addresses** for the **region** and **VPC** pre-selected in the filters displays. Addresses are displayed here if they are reserved in IPAM. This means either:

    - You manually reserved an address via IPAM (currently only possible via the [IPAM API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/ipam/#path-ips-book-a-new-ip)), or
    - You [attached a resource to a Private Network](/network/vpc/how-to/attach-resources-to-pn/): this triggers IPAM to reserve and attach an IP address for the resource on the network.

    The full range of IP addresses which are available but unreserved in each of your Private Network's [CIDR blocks](/network/vpc/concepts/#cidr-block) do not display in the list.

2. Modify the filters of the list using the drop-down menus at the top. You can filter for IP addresses within a given **region**, **VPC** and/or **Private Network**. You can also opt to filter for only [IPv4](/network/ipam/concepts/#ipv4) or [IPv6](/network/ipam/concepts/#ipv6) addresses:

3. Click **Apply filters** to activate the filters you chose, or **Reset** to reset all filters.
