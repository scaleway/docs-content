The SAML protocol is now supported for member authentication in Scaleway Organizations. Once set-up by an IAM administrator, the SAML connection becomes effective and all members can use their Identity Provider sign-in to login to Scaleway. [Read our documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/iam/how-to/set-up-identity-federation) for more information on the feature, currently on Early Access phase.
