## What is my current support plan?
You can find your support plan on [the support plan page within the Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/support/plans). The free Basic support plan is included for all Scaleway customers automatically.

## How can I change my current support plan?
You can [change your support plan](/console/account/how-to/configure-support-plans) on the support plan page via the Scaleway console.

## How frequently can I change my plan? 
You can switch plans once a month.

## I would like to upgrade my plan to get faster responses. Once I upgrade, how soon will I receive the benefits of my new plan? 
When you change your plan, the upgrade is applied immediately.

## If I upgrade my support plan in the middle of the month, how will I be billed?
You will be billed on a pro rata basis. For example, if you switch from the Silver plan to the Gold plan on the 20th of the month, you will be billed from the first to the 19th for the Silver plan. Starting from the 20th until the end of the month, you will be charged for the Gold plan.

## How does the Gold plan pricing work?
For the Gold plan, we will charge you whichever is greater, either €499 (excluding taxes) or 3% of your net spend. For example:

  - If your net monthly spend is €15,000, then 3% of €15,000 = €450. In this case, €450 is less than €499, so you will pay the fixed price at €499.
  - If your net monthly spend is €17.000, then 3% of €17.000 = €510. In this case €510 is higher than €499, so you will pay the price of €510 for the month.

## Which language does the support team speak?
Our support team can assist you in English and French, via a 24/7 live chat, ticket and/or phone, depending on your support plan level.

## How do I create a support ticket?
You can create and track your support tickets from the Scaleway console. [Follow this how to](/console/account/how-to/open-a-support-ticket/) for more details.

## How do I report abuse or suspected abuse coming from the Scaleway network?
To report abuse or suspicion of abuse from our network, open a new abuse report via [abuse.scaleway.com](http://abuse.scaleway.com). If relevant, feel free to include your logs.

## I am a Bronze plan subscriber. Can I keep my old plan? 
Your plan remains unchanged until January 1, 2023. Past this date, the Bronze plan will be removed from our pages, and you will automatically be moved to the Silver plan. If you do not wish to be subscribed to the Silver plan, you can downgrade your support plan to Basic.
