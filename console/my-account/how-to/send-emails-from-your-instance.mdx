By default, remote email ports (25, 465, 587) are blocked, and cannot be reached from our infrastructure to avoid spam. You will need to open the mail ports to send emails. You can enable them from the security group configuration.

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have created at least one Instance
  - You have completed the [identification process (KYC)](/console/my-account/how-to/verify-identity/)

</Message>



1. Click **Instances** on the side menu of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).

2. Click the **Security Groups** tab.

3. Select the security group for which you want to enable SMTP ports.

    <Message type="note">

    If you have not created any security groups, your Instance has been assigned to the default security group, so this will be the one you should modify.

    </Message>


4. Tick the checkbox **Enable SMTP**.

 The security group settings will be immediately updated on all your virtual Instances.
