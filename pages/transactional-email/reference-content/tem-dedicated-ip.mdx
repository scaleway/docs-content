- **Monitoring and alerting** - Real-time performance tracking and alerting in case of issues.
- **Corrective actions** - Proactive management in case of blacklisting or reputation decline.
- **Optimization of sends** - Automatic adjustments to maximize reception rates.

  The Scaleway TEM team will intervene as much as possible to improve and maintain the domain's reputation score. However, since the TEM team does not own the domain, and has no control over traffic, they cannot commit to the complete resolution of incidents.

## When to use a dedicated IP?

Dedicated IPs are useful for managing:

- **High volumes** - If you regularly send a large volume of emails (more than 1000 emails per day), a dedicated IP helps stabilize and improve deliverability.
- **Reputation** - Dedicated IPs help you avoid being affected by the performance of other senders on a shared IP.
- **Sensitive sends** - Cases such as financial transactions, healthcare, public, defense, or critical communications where confidentiality or reputation are crucial.
- **Compliance and security** - Regulatory compliance and maintaining the security of your email sending infrastructure, including obtaining necessary certifications and whitelisting your email sending IPs.

## When is a dedicated IP not necessary?

A dedicated IP is not always beneficial and, in some cases, may even negatively impact deliverability:

- **Low volumes** - If you send less than 10,000 emails per month, a dedicated IP may struggle to maintain a good reputation.
- **Irregular sends** - If your sending volumes are inconsistent, it can be difficult to stabilize the reputation of your IP.
- **Poor emailing practices** - A dedicated IP does not improve deliverability if you have poor emailing practices (high bounce rates, spam complaints, etc.).

## Technical limitations

- When you activate a dedicated IP on a project, all emails from the Project will be sent via this IP.
- It is not possible to use a shared and a dedicated IP on the same Project. This limitation is put in place to avoid routing and sending reputation inconsistencies. If you wish to use a shared IP for certain sends, you need to do so on a separate project.
- Only the TEM team can make advanced adjustments to the IP in the event of major incidents.
