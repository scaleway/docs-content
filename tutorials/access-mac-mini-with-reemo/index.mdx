Reemo is an ultra-low latency, high-performance desktop platform designed to allow anyone to connect to any computer and virtual environment from a Chrome browser to work and play freely from anywhere, on any device. 
Reemo works perfectly on macOS, Linux, and Windows and supports multiple peripherals.

Scaleway's Apple silicon as-a-Service offer is highly compatible with Reemo.io. Scaleway's Mac mini is built using the latest generation of Apple Mac mini hardware.
These dedicated Mac mini are designed for developing, building, testing, and signing applications for Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, Mac computers, and much more. Reemo.io can be installed easily on Scaleway's Mac mini which allows you to instantly connect to your Mac mini remotely from a Chrome browser while keeping its performance and efficiency.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to launch your Mac mini development environment on Reemo.io.

4. Click **My private key** to display your private key which you need during the installation of the Reemo client on your Mac mini. The private key is also known as **personal key** when Reemo is used freely for personal use.
    <Message type="important">
      Reemo uses a **Private Key** to connect your computers to your Account. We ask you to provide this private key when launching Reemo.exe for the first time on Windows and
      when installing it for the first time on Linux and macOS. To change or edit this private key, you can use the Reemo.exe on Windows or edit the `reemo.ini` file directly, located at `/Library/Application Support/Reemo/reemo.ini` on macOS.

## Installing the Reemo client

1. Log into your Mac mini using an exsiting [remote desktop connection](/bare-metal/apple-silicon/how-to/access-remote-desktop-mac-mini/).
2. Open a terminal once logged into your Mac mini, open a terminal. 
3. Run the following command to install the Reemo client on your machine:
    ```sh 
    # For older MacOS version (pre ventura) you can install this audio driver for audio capture support
    brew install blackhole-2ch
    # You need Administrator Priviledges
    curl -skL -o /tmp/install_reemo.x 'https://download.reemo.io/macos/setup.x' && sudo bash /tmp/install_reemo.x
    ```
    <Message type="tip">
    You can find the latest version of Reemo and instructions on how to install the application at [https://reemo.io/download](https://reemo.io/download)
    </Message>
4. Enter the **private key** of your Reemo account when prompted. Press Enter to validate.
5. Give Reemo access to screen recording (necessary for it to work). This needs to be done on macOS GUI using your existing [remote desktop connection](/bare-metal/apple-silicon/how-to/access-remote-desktop-mac-mini/). Then, in **System Settings**, click **Privacy & Security** in the sidebar (you may need to scroll down). Turn on **Screen Recording** and **Accessibility** for the Reemo app.
    Your remote computer is now displayed on your Reemo dashboard and ready to be streamed from any Chrome Browser (Desktop, Mobile etc.).
