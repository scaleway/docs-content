import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'

You can attach up to **15 volumes** at a time to a single Instance. You can attach a Block Storage volume to your Instance at any time, as long as they are both in the same [Availability Zone](/instances/concepts/#availability-zone).

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created a [Block Storage volume](/block-storage/how-to/create-a-volume/)
- At least one [Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/)

1. Click **Block Storage** in the **Storage** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The Block Storage page displays.
2. Click **Attach an Instance** under the **Linked Instance** section.
3. Select the Instance to which you want to attach your volume from the drop-down.
4. Click **Attach volume to Instance**.

Alternatively, you can attach a Block Storage volume the following way:

1. Click **Block Storage** in the **Storage** section of the Scaleway console side menu. Your volumes display.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Attach to Instance** next to the volume of your choice. A pop-up displays.
3. Select the Instance to which you want to attach your volume from the drop-down.
4. Click **Attach volume to Instance**.

You can also attach a Block storage to an Instance the following way:

1. Click **Block Storage** in the **Storage** section of the Scaleway console side menu. Your volumes display.
2. Click the name of the volume you want to attach. An overview of your volume displays.
3. Click **Attach** under **Instance** in the **Volume information** section. A pop-up displays.
5. Select the Instance to which you want to attach your volume from the drop-down.
6. Click **Attach volume to Instance**.

<Message type="note">
  To use **[Block Storage Low Latency](/block-storage/) 15k**, your Instance must have at least **3 GiB/s of block bandwidth**.  
  You can verify if an Instance type meets this requirement by consulting the [Scaleway Instances internet and Block Storage bandwidth overview](/instances/reference-content/instances-bandwidth-overview/) documentation.  

  Alternatively, use the [Instances API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/#path-instance-types-list-instance-types) to check the `block_bandwidth` field at `/instance/v1/zones/{zone}/products/servers`.  
  This field provides detailed information about block bandwidth for each Instance type, helping you ensure compatibility with high-performance storage.
