To ensure platform stability and performance, we have implemented a rate limit of 20 DNS queries per second for **full DNS resolutions** per Container instance. 

This rate limit **only applies** to queries that require a full DNS resolution, and is enforced independently for each Container instance. This rate limit is set at a level that is well above typical usage, so most users should not be impacted. If you do encounter any issues, [reach out to our support team](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create) for assistance.

Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/serverless/containers/reference-content/dns-query-rate-limit/) for more information on DNS query rate limiting.
