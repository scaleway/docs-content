An Organization alias can now be st-up by an IAM admin inside the Organization. With this alias, a dedicated URL can be built for any member of the Organization to easily login. [Read our documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/organizations-and-projects/how-to/set-organization-alias/) for more information on the feature.
