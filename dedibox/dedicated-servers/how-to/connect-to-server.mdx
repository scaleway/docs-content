A common way of connecting to your Dedibox server is via the command line, using SSH. SSH is a secure communication protocol, which imposes an encryption key exchange at the beginning of the connection. This means that the exchange of data between the client and the server will be encrypted.

However, you may also connect to your server via a graphical interface such as Windows Remote Desktop.

You can also use FTP, SFTP or SCP to transfer data to and from your server.

## How to connect via SSH 

### From OSX (Mac) and Linux

1. Open a terminal program on your local machine.

2. Enter the command below into the terminal. Make sure you replace `your_private_key` with the filename of your private key (often `id_rsa`), `username` with the username you defined when [installing your server](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/install-a-server/) and `your_server_ip` with the IP address of your server.

  ```bash
  ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_private_key username@your_server_ip
  ```

3. If / when prompted, allow connection to the host by typing `yes`, then press **Enter**.
  ```
  The authenticity of host 'myhost.ext (212.47.226.35)' cannot be established.
  RSA key fingerprint is 4f:ba:65:cf:14:64:a7:1e:b6:07:7c:00:71:95:21:fa.
  Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
  ```

### From Windows

To connect to your server from Windows, you will need to use a small application called **PuTTy**, an SSH client.

1. Download and install PuTTy [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)

2. Launch PuTTy on your computer. The main screen of the application displays:

   <Lightbox src="scaleway-putty-main.png" alt="" />

3. Enter your server's IP address in the **Hostname** field.

   <Message type="tip">

  You can find the IP address of your server in the [management console](https://console.online.net/en/server/list)

   </Message>

4. In the side menu, under **Connection** navigate to the **Auth** sub-category. Do this by expanding **Connection**, then **SSH** and finally clicking on **Auth**:

5. Click the **Browse** button and select the private key file you [generated previously](/dedibox-console/my-account/how-to/upload-an-ssh-key).

6. Click **Open** at the bottom of the screen to open a connection to the server. Upon the first connection, PuttY asks you to allow the connection to the host.

7. Click **OK** to confirm.

   The terminal window diplays.

8. Enter your username and password to authenticate against the server with your SSH key.

You are now connected to your server.

## How to connect via Remote Desktop

The following steps show you how to connect to your Dedibox on which you have installed Windows Server, from your local Windows machine.

1. Open the **Remote Desktop Connection** tool on your local Windows machine.

2. Click the drop-down arrow next to **Show connections**.

3. Enter the following information:
    - In **Computer**, enter the IP address of your Dedibox server (e.g. 163.172.20.01).
    - In **Username**, for a Windows Server type **Administrateur**.

4. Click **Connect**. You are prompted to enter a password.

5. Enter the password that you set during installation of your Dedibox Windows Server machine, and click **OK**.

6. You may be asked to confirm that you want to connect. Click **Yes**.

You are connected to the graphical interface of your Windows Server. If you need to change the language, refer to the appropriate [how-to](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/change-win-server-language)

## How to transer data to your server

As well as connecting to your server's terminal, you may also want to transfer data to and from your server. Here are two ways you can do this.

### via SFTP

SFTP, or **S**ecure **F**ile **T**ransfer **P**rotocol, is basically FTP in a SSH tunnel. You can use the graphical client [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org) to easily transfer data to and from your server via SFTP. 

1. Download and install [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org) on your local machine.

2. Open Filezilla and navigate to **File** > **Site Manager**.

3. Enter the following information:
    - **Protocol**: SFTP
    - **Host**: The IP address of your server
    - **Port**: 22
    - **User**: Your username
    - **Key file**: The location of your [private key file](/dedibox-console/my-account/how-to/upload-an-ssh-key)

4. Click **Connect**.

You are connected to your Dedibox server, and can use the graphical interface to transfer files between your server and your local machine. See Filezilla's [official documentation](https://filezilla-project.org/support.php) for further help with using Filezilla.

### via SCP

SCP, or **S**ecure **C**o**p**y, is a way to securely transfer files between two machines using a UNIX terminal. SCP also uses SSH for security.

1. Open a terminal on your local machine.

2. Enter the following command:

  ```
  scp file username@ipaddress:DestinationDirectory
  ```
  
  Ensure you make the following replacements:
    - Replace **file** with the filepath of the file you want to transfer.
    - Replace **username** with your own username
    - Replace **ipaddress** with the IP address of your Dedibox server.
    - Replace **DestinationDirectory** with the filepath on your Dedibox server you want to transfer the file to.

  
  For example, the file `config.txt` to the directory `/home/toto/prog` on the server, you will run the following command:

  ```
  scp config.txt toto@62.210.***.***:/home/toto/prog/
  ```

  ```
  scp config.txt toto@62.210.***.***:prog/
  ```
