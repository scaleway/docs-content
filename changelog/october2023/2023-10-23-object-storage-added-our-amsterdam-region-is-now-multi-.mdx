The multi-AZ Standard class is now available in the Amsterdam region, ensuring the resiliency of your data across 3 Availability Zones (AZ) for all new objects uploaded in Standard class from now on. 
This is our second region to support multi-AZ by design and to offer 99,9% of availability SLA, after the Paris region. Check out our [FAQ](/faq/new-object-storage-classes/) for more information.
