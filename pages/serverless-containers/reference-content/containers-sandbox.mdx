In the context of Scaleway Serverless Containers, a [Sandbox environment](/serverless-containers/concepts/#sandbox) is a critical security mechanism that isolates each container from others, ensuring that they operate in a secure and controlled space. Containers run in dedicated execution environments that prevent unauthorized access and potential interference between different resources.

Scaleway Serverless Containers offers two sandbox environment options:

- Sandbox v1 (legacy)
- Sandbox v2 (recommended)

## Sandbox v1

Sandbox v1 is Serverless Containers' legacy sandboxing environment with slower [cold starts](/serverless-containers/concepts/#cold-start), but fully supports Linux system call interface.

<Message type="important">
Sandbox v1 is known to experience clock drift over time. A difference of approximately **two seconds** can be observed after 24 hours of uninterrupted execution. This issue especially affects long-running containers, whereas short-lived containers are much less impacted. Update to sandbox v2 to solve the issue.

## Sandbox v2

Sandbox v2 is a modern isolation environment that relies on [gVisor](https://gvisor.dev/). This option offers faster [cold starts](/serverless-containers/concepts/#cold-start), but only implements a selection of Linux syscalls.
Refer to the [official gVisor documentation](https://gvisor.dev/docs/user_guide/compatibility/linux/amd64/) for a comprehensive list of supported syscalls.
