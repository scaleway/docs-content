[Multifactor Authentication (MFA)](/account/concepts/#multifactor-authentication-mfa) adds an extra layer of security to your Organization. Enforcing MFA will make it mandatory for all users in the Organization.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to enforce MFA

1. Click the name of your Organization in the top right drop-down menu. The Organization dashboard displays.
2. Go to the **Security** tab.
3. Scroll to the **Organization Multifactor Authentication (MFA)** section.
4. Click **Enforce MFA**.
5. Type **ENFORCE** in the box.
    <Message type="important">
    Keep in mind that:
    - MFA will become mandatory for all users in the Organization. When you invite [Guests](/iam/concepts/#guest) to your Organization in the future, they must have set up MFA to be able to join. <br /><br />
    - You can only enforce MFA if all Guests in your Organization have already set up MFA on their accounts.
    - If MFA is enforced in your Organization, all new [Members](/iam/concepts/#member) you create will have to enable MFA within the [grace period](/iam/concepts/#grace-period) you set. If they fail to do so before the grace period is over, their account will be locked. The same applies for existing members who do not yet have MFA enabled. Once you enforce MFA, they also have to comply with this [security requirement](/iam/how-to/enforce-security-requirements-members) within the grace period.
    </Message>
6. Click **Enforce MFA**.
    - If all users in your Organization already have enabled MFA, a confirmation message appears on the top right corner of the screen.

    - If at least one of the Guests does not have MFA enabled, you must send them an [MFA reminder](#how-to-send-an-mfa-reminder).

## How to send an MFA reminder

1. Click **IAM** in the top right drop-down menu. The IAM dashboard displays.
2. Go to the **Users** tab.
3. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Send MFA reminder** next to the name of a user that has MFA disabled.
    The user will receive an email requesting that they enable MFA.

## How to stop enforcing MFA

<Message type="requirement">
  [MFA is enforced](#how-to-enforce-mfa) in your Scaleway Organization.
</Message>

1. Click the name of your Organization in the top right drop-down menu. The Organization dashboard displays.
2. Go to the **Settings** tab.
3. Scroll to the **Organization Multifactor Authentication (MFA)** section.
4. Click **Stop enforcing MFA**.
    <Message type="important">
      Disabling this feature means that users in this Organization will no longer be required to have MFA set up on their accounts.
    </Message>
5. Type **STOP**.
6. Click **Stop enforcing MFA** to confirm.
    The Owner of your Organization will receive an informative email saying MFA is no longer enforced.
