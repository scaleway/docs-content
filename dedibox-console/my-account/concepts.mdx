## Authorized SSH key

An SSH key (**S**ecure **Sh**ell key) allows passwordless authentication on SSH sessions. An SSH key is generated by creating an RSA key pair, consisting of two elements:

- a sensitive **identification key**, (aka private key) which must be stored securely
- a **public key** which is uploaded to the Scaleway Dedibox interface.

The public key is kept in your Scaleway account and transferred to the Dedibox server during the installation, while the identification key is kept securely on your local computer. When connecting to the instance via SSH, a trusted connection to the machine is established using the key pair.
