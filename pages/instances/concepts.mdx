## Availability Zone

An Availability Zone is an isolated location within a specific region, providing dedicated infrastructure and services. For example, `fr-par-1`, `fr-par-2`, and `fr-par-3` are Availability Zones within the Paris region.

For a comprehensive list of regions and their corresponding Availability Zones, refer to our [Product Availability Guide](/account/reference-content/products-availability/).

## Block volumes

Block volumes offer network-attached storage that can be attached or detached from Instances like a virtual hard drive. They behave like traditional disks and can expand the storage capacity of an Instance.

## Boot-on-Block

<Macro id="storage-boot-on-block" />

## Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT)

Scaleway used a 1:1 carrier-grade NAT (CGNAT) setup for legacy Instance types. Unlike standard CGNAT, where multiple users share a single public IP, this setup ensured that each Instance had a unique NAT IP mapped to a unique public IP. This preserved IP exclusivity and prevented connectivity issues.

All recent Instance types support routed IPs through [IP Mobility](#ip-mobility).

## Cloud-init

Cloud-init is a multi-distribution package that [enables boot-time customization for cloud servers](/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes/#how-to-use-cloud-init). It allows automatic Instance configuration upon boot, transforming a generic Ubuntu image into a fully configured server within seconds.

## Cost-Optimized Instances

[Cost-Optimized Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/cost-optimized-instances/) are production-grade Instances designed for scalable infrastructures. They support the boot-on-block feature and allow high-performance services with high-end CPUs.

## Development Instances

[Development Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/cost-optimized-instances/) are reliable and flexible Instances designed for hosting websites, applications, and development environments.

## Dynamic IP

A dynamic IP is a public IP address that is released back into the general pool when an Instance is stopped. When the Instance is restarted, it may receive a different dynamic IP.

<<<<<<< HEAD
This differs from [Flexible IPs](#flexible-ip), which remain associated with an Instance even when it is stopped. Dynamic IPs can only be assigned via the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/). Learn more in our [Billing FAQ](/faq/billing/#when-does-the-billing-of-an-instance-start-and-stop).
=======
You can choose to give your Instance a dynamic IP address when creating or updating your Instance via the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/) only. Read our [billing FAQ](/billing/faq/#when-does-the-billing-of-an-instance-start-and-stop) for more information about the billing of dynamic and flexible IPs.
>>>>>>> main

## Flexible IP

Flexible IPs are public IP addresses that can be held independently of any Instance. By default, Scaleway Instances are assigned a Flexible IP. These IPs can be detached and reassigned to different Instances as needed.

For more details, see our guide on [Using Flexible IP Addresses](/instances/how-to/use-flexips/).

## GPU Instances

[GPU Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/gpu-instances/) are powerful Instances equipped with high-end Nvidia GPUs. See our [dedicated GPU documentation](/gpu/) for details.

## Image

An image is a complete backup of an Instance, containing all its [volumes](#volumes). It can be used to restore an Instance or create multiple Instances with the same configuration. For backing up a single volume, use the [snapshot](#snapshot) feature instead.

## Instance

An Instance is a virtual computing unit with dedicated resources such as CPU, RAM, and storage. Different Instance types cater to various workloads. See our [Instance Types Documentation](/instances/reference-content/choosing-instance-type/) for details.

## InstantApp

An InstantApp is a pre-installed application image. Choosing an InstantApp during [Instance creation](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) enables immediate use of the application.

## IP Mobility

IP Mobility eliminates the need for NAT IPs. Instead, the public IP is routed directly to the Instance, ensuring the IP remains unchanged during stop/start operations or migration to a different hypervisor.

<Message type="note">
  Your IP address remains the same only if you use a Flexible IP. Instances with Dynamic IPs will still receive a new IP upon restart.
</Message>

## Learning Instances

[Learning Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/stardust-instances/) are ideal for small workloads and simple applications. You can create one Instance per Availability Zone (available in `fr-par-1` and `nl-ams-1`).

## Local volumes

Local volumes are SSD-based storage solutions hosted on the local hypervisor. Their size is fixed and depends on the Instance type. Some Instances do not use local volumes and instead [boot directly on block volumes](#boot-on-block).

## Placement groups

Placement groups distribute Compute Instances across different physical hypervisors to optimize availability (`max_availability`) or reduce network latency (`low_latency`). [Learn more](/instances/how-to/use-placement-groups/).

## Production-Optimized Instances

[Production-Optimized Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/production-optimized-instances/) (POP2) provide dedicated compute resources for high-performance workloads. Variants include:

- **POP2**: Block Storage-based Instances.
- **POP2-HC**: High-memory Instances (vCPU:RAM 1:8).
- **POP2-HM**: Balanced memory Instances (vCPU:RAM 1:2).
- **POP2-HN**: High-network Instances (vCPU:RAM 1:2, up to 10 Gbps bandwidth).

## Private Networks

Private Networks enable secure, isolated communication between Instances without internet access. [Learn more](/instances/how-to/use-private-networks/).

## Security groups

Security groups [control inbound and outbound traffic](/instances/how-to/use-security-groups/). They can be:

- **Stateful**: Allows return traffic for initiated connections.
- **Stateless**: Enforces strict inbound/outbound rules regardless of connection origin.

<Message type="note">
  Security groups filter **public** traffic only. Use a firewall (e.g., `iptables`) to control Private Network traffic.
</Message>

## Snapshot

<<<<<<< HEAD
A snapshot is a point-in-time backup of a specific volume. Unlike images, which capture entire Instances, snapshots allow granular control over volume backups. [Learn more](/instances/how-to/create-a-snapshot/).
=======
A snapshot takes a picture of a specific volume at one point in time. For example, you may have a server with one volume containing the OS and another containing the application data and want to use different snapshot strategies on both volumes. [Creating snapshots of your volumes](/block-storage/how-to/create-a-snapshot/) gives you total freedom of which volumes you want to back up, while [images](#image) are more convenient for full backups of your Instance.

## Snapshot type

An image is composed of snapshots of volumes. Snapshots can only be restored to a volume of the original type.

## Standby mode

Standby mode is a way to stop an Instance temporarily. When you [put an Instance in standby mode](/instances/how-to/use-standby-mode/), the server is halted, but the Instance remains allocated to your account, and all data remains on the Local Storage of the Instance.

## Stateful security groups

Stateful security groups disregard the default policy and inbound/outbound rules if a connection is initiated from your Instance. Traffic will always be permitted on connections that you initiated. This is useful for example if you want to initiate connections on many and various ports for messaging, video streaming, or other purposes. In this case, the traffic from/to that connection will not be blocked, even if you have defined a rule that would otherwise do so. [Learn how to use security groups](/instances/how-to/use-security-groups/).

## Stateless security groups

Stateless security groups strictly apply the default policy and inbound/outbound rules, regardless of whether a connection is initiated from your Instance or not. This is useful if you know exactly which ports you will always require for your Instance, e.g. port `22` for SSH. You can make your security group stateless, define a rule to allow traffic on port `22` and block incoming traffic on other ports regardless of whether a connection is initiated from your Instance on this port. [Learn how to use security groups](/instances/how-to/use-security-groups/).

## Tags

Tags help organize, filter, and monitor cloud resources efficiently. Multiple tags can be assigned to each Scaleway product.

## Volumes

Scaleway offers two volume types:

<<<<<<< HEAD
- **Local volumes**: Fixed-size SSD storage hosted on the local hypervisor.
- **Block volumes**: Network-attached storage that can be attached/detached like a virtual disk.

For more details, refer to [Block Volumes](#block-volumes) and [Local Volumes](#local-volumes).
=======
* **[Local volumes](/local-storage/)**: The local volume of an Instance is an all-SSD-based storage solution, using a RAID array for redundancy and performance, hosted on the local hypervisor. On Scaleway Instances, the size of the local volume is fixed and depends on the Instance type. Some Instance types do not use local volumes and [boot directly on block volumes](#boot-on-block).

* **[Block volumes*](/block-storage/)*: Block volumes provide network-attached storage you can plug in and out of Instances like a virtual hard drive. Block volumes behave like regular disks and can be used to increase the storage of an Instance.
