Reverse DNS is the opposite of classic "forward" DNS, and maps an IP address to a hostname. This can be useful if, for example, you want to send emails from your server.

<Message type="important">

  If you are using the default reverse DNS (*.pub.instances.scw.cloud), you may experience problems with deliverability of your emails and during the subscription of certain tools like [Junk Mail Reporting Program](https://postmaster.live.com/snds/JMRP.aspx.) (JMRP) and [Smart Network Data Services](https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/snds/FAQ.aspx#WhatIsSNDS) (SNDS) - services provided by Microsoft to whitelist your IPâ€™s on their email servers.

  - You have an account and are logged into [console.scaleway.com](https://console.scaleway.com) 
  - You have [created an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) and have not detached its public (flexible) IP address
  - You have configured a matching `A-record` pointing to your IP address. Note that if you have created the A record recently, it may take up to 24 hours for the operation to be completed.

2. Click the **Flexible IPs** tab.

3. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the IP address you wish to configure reverse DNS for, and select **Edit Reverse** from the drop-down menu.

4. Enter the reverse DNS you want to associate with the IP address. Generally this corresponds to your hostname.

  Once the reverse DNS has been updated, it may take up to 24 hours before it is fully propagated.
