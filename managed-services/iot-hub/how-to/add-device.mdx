A device is a representation of a device or program that is connected to the cloud. Through a hub, it exchanges messages with other devices and cloud services.

Devices use the [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) protocol to send and receive messages. MQTT over WebSocket is also supported through a dedicated [network](/managed-services/iot-hub/how-to/connect-default-mqtt-network).

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created an IoT Hub](/managed-services/iot-hub/how-to/create-hub)

1. Click **IoT Hub** in the **Managed Services** section of the side menu. The list of your IoT Hubs displays.
2. Click the name of the IoT Hub on which you want to add a device. The hub's overview page displays.
3. Click **Add devices** in the devices tab of your hub.

4. Enter a **name** for your device. It must be unique among the devices in this hub, and cannot be changed once created. Optionally, set a device description (only for display purposes).
5. Choose a **security setting** for your device. You can either deny or allow insecure connections.

6. Click **Add device to hub**.
7. Download the credentials of the device and keep them safe.

    <Message type="important">
      Make sure to download or copy the **Device certificate** and the **Device private key**. These files are required to establish a connection from the device to your hub. For security reasons, the private key is not stored on our side, and you will not be able to access it later.
    </Message>
8. Click **Close** to leave the wizard or **Add new device** to add another device.

    Once the device is added, you may continue to configure [IoT Hub Routes](/managed-services/iot-hub/how-to/create-route/) to export your data to other Scaleway services.
