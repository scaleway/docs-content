This page shows you how to manage your Serverless Containers namespace. [Namespaces](/serverless/containers/concepts/#namespace) allow you to group your containers and share environment variables between them.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a containers namespace](/serverless/containers/how-to/create-a-containers-namespace/)

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The containers page displays.
2. Click the containers namespace you want to manage.
3. Click the **Namespace settings** tab. Here, you can view information about the region, registry endpoint and description of your namespace.
4. Add any additional environment variables you wish to add by clicking **+Add**, entering the key/value pair, and clicking **Save**.
5. Add **secrets** for your container. Secrets are environment variables which are injected into your container, but the values are not retained or displayed by Scaleway after initial validation.
