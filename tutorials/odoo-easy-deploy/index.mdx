[Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/) is a suite of open-source business apps written in Python. With a range of Odoo apps and Community apps available as part of the suite, Odoo promises to help companies address all their business needs in a single, cost-effective and modular solution. In Odoo, all the apps talk to each other, so the pain of getting different apps from different providers to communicate is gone. Odoo is designed to cover all business needs, from websites and e-commerce to manufacturing, inventory, HR and accounting, all seamlessly integrated. It's used by more than 2 million users worldwide, by companies ranging from sole traders to those with hundreds of thousands of employees.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to install Odoo on a [Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule](/compute/kubernetes/quickstart/) by using the [Easy-Deploy](/compute/kubernetes/how-to/enable-easy-deploy/) feature. Most of this can be achieved from within the Scaleway Console. The steps of this tutorial are shown in the side menu on the right.

## Creating a Scaleway Container Registry namespace

1. In the Scaleway Console, access the `Container Registry` dashboard, and click `Create a namespace`

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-registry_home.png" alt="" />

2. Complete the required information:

    - **Namespace name**: any unique name of your choice (must contain only alphanumeic characters, dots and dashes)
    - **Namespace description** a description for your Namespace
    - **Region** a geographical region for your namespace.
    - **Privacy Policy**: you must select `Public` (currently the Easy-Deploy feature only works on public images)

  Check the summary, then click `Create a namespace`:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-namespace.png" alt="" />

  The following screen displays:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-namespace-created.png" alt="" />

  We will follow these instructions in the next step.

## Using Docker to get the official Odoo image and pushing it to your Scaleway Container Registry

1. Open a terminal window on your local machine, and log in to your namespace with Docker. Use the following command, with the relevant information for your own namespace name and [Scaleway Secret Key](/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key/)

  ```
  docker login rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/odoo-tutorial-namespace -u nologin -p $SCW_SECRET_KEY
  ```

2. Pull the latest official Odoo image with the following command:

  ```
  docker pull odoo:latest
  ```

3. Tag the image, ready to push it to your Container Registry:

  ```
  docker tag odoo:latest rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/odoo-tutorial-namespace/odoo:latest
  ```

4. Push it to your Container Registry with the following command:

  ```
  docker push rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/odoo-tutorial-namespace/odoo:latest
  ```

  It may take a few minutes for this step to complete. You will see output like this as the image uploads:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-pushing.png" alt="" />

3. Once the process has finished, wait another minute then check your Scaleway Container Registry to make sure the image has successfully appeared there:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-image-pushed.png" alt="" />

  Now that the Odoo image is in our Container Registry, we're ready to deploy it with Kubernetes.

## Creating a Kubernetes Kapsule Cluster and deploying Odoo on it

1. In the Scaleway Console, access the Kubernetes dashboard. Click `Create a cluster`:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-kapsule_splashscreen.png" alt="" />

2. Enter the required information:

    - **Cluster name**: any identifying name of your choice (must contain only alphanumeric characters and dashes)
    - **Cluster description** a description for your cluster
    - **Region** a geographical region for your cluster.
    - **Node type**: the type of instance you want for your cluster
    - **Node options**: choose your required options, or leave at default values

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-cluster.png" alt="" />

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-cluster-2.png" alt="" />

3. Check the summary, then click `Create a cluster`:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-cluster-3.png" alt="" />

  You will see a process screen telling you that your cluster is being created. You may also see an additional warning that some of your pools are not yet ready. After a few minutes, your cluster should be up and running and ready to use:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-cluser-created.png" alt="" />

4. On your cluster's dashboard, click the `Easy Deploy` tab, and then click `Deploy a container`:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-container.png" alt="" />

5. Enter the required information:

    - **Container name**: any identifying name of your choice for your container (must contain only alphanumeric characters and dashes)
    - **Kubernetes namespace** any identifying name of your choice for the Kubernetes namespace on which your container will run (must contain only alphanumeric characters and dashes)

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-deploy-container1.png" alt="" />

6. In `Registry namespace`, select the namespace you created earlier from the dropdown list. Then select the `Odoo` container you pushed to it.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-deploy-container2.png" alt="" />

7. You can leave the other settings at default value for now, we will come back to them later. Click `Deploy a container`:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-deploy-container3.png" alt="" />

  Your container should now deploy:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-container-deploying.png" alt="" />

## Installing a PostgreSQL database

The Odoo image's [documentation](https://hub.docker.com/_/odoo) specifies that it requires a running PostgreSQL server, which we will now create:

1. In the Scaleway console, go to the `Database` dashboard, and click `Create an Instance`:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-db-create-instance.png" alt="" />

2. Start filling out the necessary information by selecting a `PostgreSQL-12` engine and choosing your **region** and **node type** (we recommend minimum `DB-DEV-L`). You can leave `Backup` and `High Availability` checked as default:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-db1.png" alt="" />

3. In the Credentials section, enter a **username** and **password**. Then enter a **name** for your Database Instance. Note all of these down as you will need them in a future step.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-db2.png" alt="" />

4. Check the summary and click `Create an Instance`:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-db3.png" alt="" />

  A screen reports the progress of the database creation. After a minute or two, a screen similar to the following should confirm the creation of your Database Instance:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-db-created.png" alt="" />

5. Take note of the `Endpoint` information, you will need it in the next step.

## Connecting the Odoo application to the PostgreSQL server

The Odoo image's [documentation](https://hub.docker.com/_/odoo) tells us that by modifying the Odoo application's environment variables `HOST`, `PORT`, `USER` and `PASSWORD` we can easily connect it to a PostgreSQL server. We will now expose our Odoo application with a Load Balancer, and set these environment variables so that it can connect to our newly created database.

1. In the Scaleway Console, go back to your `Kubernetes` dashboard and select the cluster you created and deployed your Odoo image on:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-edit-cluster.png" alt="" />

2. Click the `Easy Deploy` tab. Then click the `...` icon next to your Odoo container and select `Edit`:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-edit-cluster2.png" alt="" />

3. Push the slider to `Add Load Balancer`. Under `Container port to expose`, enter `80:8069`. This means that your load balancer will map port for incoming traffic (80 is the default for http, you could use 443 for https) to your exposed container port (8069 being the default Odoo port). Click `Add`:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-expose-port.png" alt="" />

4. You should leave the `Number of replicas` option at its default of 1 to avoid session token conflicts. Under `Environment Variables` click `Add Variable` four times, as you will need to add four environment variables here:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-edit-container2.png" alt="" />

5. Add the following information for your variables. Then click `Update Container`:

    - **USER**: the username that you set when creating your PostgreSQL database
    - **PASSWORD**: the password that you set when creating your PostgreSQL database
    - **HOST**: the first part of your database's endpoint, which you previously noted down. If your endpoint was `123.456.78.91:1011`, then the host is `123.456.78.91`
    - **PORT**: the second part of your database's endpoint. If your endpoint was `123.456.78.91:1011`, then the port is `1011`

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-update-container.png" alt="" />

  The edit will be carried out and you will be taken back to your container's dashboard.

6. On the left side menu of the Scaleway Console, click `Load Balancer`. You should see a screen similar to the following:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-load-balancer1.png" alt="" />

7. Click the load balancer to expand its display. Note down the value of `Load Balancer IPs`

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-load-balancer2.png" alt="" />

## Launching Odoo in a browser

1. Enter the `Load Balancer IP` in a new browser window. It will take you to the Odoo landing page:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-odoo-landing1.png" alt="" />

2. Enter the required information:

    - **Master Password**: Odoo will generate and auto-complete a master password for you (displayed at the top of the page), which you can change if you wish
    - **Database Name**: Your choice of name
    - **Email**: Your email address
    - **Password**: Choose a password
    - **Phone Number**: Your phone number
    - **Language**: Your choice of language
    - **Country**: Your country
    - **Demo data**: If you check this box, the application will be populated with demo data (which you can later overwrite with your own data) as a guide.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-odoo-landing2.png" alt="" />

  The application will now launch. This may take a few moments. The following page displays:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-odoo-demo.png" alt="" />

Congratulations! You can now start installing apps, configuring your settings and seeing what Odoo has to offer. Check out the [official Odoo documentation](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/14.0/) for more help. You may also wish to look at our tutorial on [Installing Odoo on a Scaleway Dedibox](/tutorials/odoo/), which gives some more information about [configuring Odoo](/tutorials/odoo/#-Configuring-Odoo).

<Message type="note">

  Please keep in mind that the Easy Deploy feature has been designed to help you get started with Kubernetes: we do not recommend using this feature for production use for two reasons. Firstly, because it requires your container image to be publicly available, i.e. without access restrictions. And secondly, because it will not allow you to do such things as adding persistent volumes, linking several containers together etc, without fine-tuning some settings yourself.
