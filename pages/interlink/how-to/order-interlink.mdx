InterLink is Scaleway's product to let you create a secure, private connection between your external infrastructure, and your Scaleway VPC. This allows you to direct your traffic safely from your Scaleway infrastructure to your on-premises infrastructure, away from the public internet.

InterLink is available in two versions:

- Hosted: The physical connection is provided by a [partner](/interlink/concepts/#partner) and shared between several users
- Self-hosted: The physical connection is provisioned by and dedicated to a single customer

<Lightbox image={image1} alt="A diagram shows how a Scaleway VPC, to the left, can be attached to an InterLink, which then connects to external customer infrastructure." />

This guide takes you through the process of creating an InterLink via the Scaleway console.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to create an InterLink

1. Click **InterLink** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. If you have not already created an InterLink, the product ordering page is displayed.

2. Click **Create InterLink**. The creation wizard displays.

    <Lightbox image={image2} alt="A screen of the Scaleway console shows the first section of the InterLink order form. The different sections are explained in the steps below." />

3. Choose a [region](/interlink/concepts/#region) for your InterLink. This must correspond to the Scaleway VPC you want to attach later.

3. Select a [physical connection type](/interlink/concepts/#connection-type)for your InterLink, either [hosted](TODO) or [self-hosted](TODO).

4. Select the following options, depending on your physical connection type: 

   <Tabs id="interlink-create">
    
        <TabsTab label="Hosted">
        Select a [partner](/interlink/concepts/#partner). To establish an InterLink connection via a partner, generally you must be a client of that partner, e.g. with your infrastructure in their datacenter, or on your own premises using the partner as a network provider. [Get help with choosing a partner](/interlink/reference-content/overview/#hosted-interlinks).
        </TabsTab>

        Also select the [location](/interlink/concepts/#location) for your InterLink. This represents the physical location where the connection to Scaleway's network will be established.

        <TabsTab label="Self-hosted">
        Select a [dedicated connection](TODO). The InterLink will be hosted over this connection. You must have already provisioned this connection via the Scaleway sales team. [Contact sales](TODO) if you would like to provision a dedicated connection: this cannot be done via the Scaleway console or API.
        
        </TabsTab>
    </Tabs>

5. Choose a [bandwidth](/interlink/concepts/#bandwidth) amount. This represents the maximum bandwidth that will be available over the InterLink.

6. Attach up to two [routing policies](TODO). InterLink needs a policy for each IP traffic type it should route: all routes are blocked except those whitelisted in the policy(ies). Alternatively, skip this step and attach routing policies later.

7. Enter a name and optional tags for your InterLink.

8. Click **Create InterLink**.

- **Hosted InterLink**: You must now contact your chosen partner to request they provision your InterLink from their end. Note that Scaleway starts billing you for the InterLink as soon as you create it, and your partner may charge you additional fees once provisioned on their end. For full details of the provisioning process, including how to contact your partner and what other steps you need to take, see the page [How to complete hosted InterLink provisioning](/interlink/how-to/complete-provisioning/).

- **Self-hosted InterLinks**: Your InterLink is now fully created. However, you must complete InterLink setup on the customer side by configuring your network device. For full details, see [How to complete self-hosted InterLink setup](TODO)

<Message type="note">
If your InterLink has a `Failed` status, it means there was a configuration error on the Scaleway side as we attempted to create the InterLink. Our technical team is automatically made aware of such a problem, and will intervene to resolve it. If you have any concerns, open a support ticket.
