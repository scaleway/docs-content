[Mattermost](https://www.mattermost.com/) is an open-source messaging tool for inter-team communication, released under the MIT license and available both in a free team and paid enterprise edition. This tutorial will show you how to install a Mattermost instance with a NGINX frontend proxy and a MariaDB database.

## Installing Mattermost

1. Add the Mattermost Server PPA repository to your system by running the following command:
    ```
    curl -o- https://deb.packages.mattermost.com/repo-setup.sh | sudo bash -s mattermost
    ```
2. Update the `apt` packet manager to use the newly installed repository:
    ```
    apt update
    ```
3. Install Mattermost using `apt`:
    ```
    apt install mattermost -y
    ```

4. Edit the configuration file. A sample configuration file is located at `/opt/mattermost/config/config.defaults.json`. Rename this configuration file with correct permissions:
    ```
    sudo install -C -m 600 -o mattermost -g mattermost /opt/mattermost/config/config.defaults.json /opt/mattermost/config/config.json
    ```
    Configure the following properties in this file using your favorite text editor:

    * Set `DriverName` to `"postgres"`. PostgreSQL is the default and recommended database for all Mattermost installations.
    * Set `DataSource` to `"postgres://mmuser:<mmuser-password>@<host-name-or-IP>:5432/mattermost?sslmode=disable&connect_timeout=10"` replacing `mmuser`, `<mmuser-password>`, `<host-name-or-IP>` and `mattermost` with your database name.
    * Set `"SiteURL"`: The domain name for the Mattermost application (e.g. `https://mattermost.example.com`).

    Save the file and exit the text editor.
5. Start the Mattermost server.
    ```
    systemctl start mattermost
    ```

    You can now connect to your Mattermost server at `http://your_servers_ip:8065` and create your first user and do some initial configuration and setup.

## Installing an Nginx proxy with Let's Encrypt

For security reasons, it is recommended to put the application behind a proxy. Nginx is being used as frontend for the application. To provide an encrypted connection, [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) is used to generate a free [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) SSL certificate to encrypt the connection to the instance.

1. Install Nginx and Certbot.
    ```
    apt install nginx python-certbot-nginx -y
    ```
2. Create a new server block for Mattermost (replace `mattermost.example.com` with the FQDN of your instance).
    ```
    touch /etc/nginx/sites-available/mattermost.example.com
    ```

    And enter the following content in the file:

    ```
    upstream backend {
      server 127.0.0.1:8065;
      keepalive 32;
    }

    proxy_cache_path /var/cache/nginx levels=1:2 keys_zone=mattermost_cache:10m max_size=3g inactive=120m use_temp_path=off;

    server {
      listen 80;
      server_name    mattermost.example.com;

      location ~ /api/v[0-9]+/(users/)?websocket$ {
          proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
          proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
          client_max_body_size 50M;
          proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
          proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
          proxy_set_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN;
          proxy_buffers 256 16k;
          proxy_buffer_size 16k;
          client_body_timeout 60;
          send_timeout 300;
          lingering_timeout 5;
          proxy_connect_timeout 90;
          proxy_send_timeout 300;
          proxy_read_timeout 90s;
          proxy_pass http://backend;
      }

      location / {
          client_max_body_size 50M;
          proxy_set_header Connection "";
          proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
          proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
          proxy_set_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN;
          proxy_buffers 256 16k;
          proxy_buffer_size 16k;
          proxy_read_timeout 600s;
          proxy_cache mattermost_cache;
          proxy_cache_revalidate on;
          proxy_cache_min_uses 2;
          proxy_cache_use_stale timeout;
          proxy_cache_lock on;
          proxy_http_version 1.1;
          proxy_pass http://backend;
      }
    }
    ```
3. Remove the default server block of Nginx.
    ```
    rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
    ```
4. Enable the Mattermost server block by linking it to the sites-enabled directory:
    ```
    ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/mattermost.example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/mattermost.example.com
    ```
5. Restart Nginx:
    ```
    sudo service nginx restart
    ```
6. Run Certbot.
    ```
    certbot
    ```

    The application will ask you several questions. You have to confirm the steps as described. For more information refer to our documentation about certbot.

## Setting up Mattermost

1. Connect to your instance by going to `https://your_servers_ip`. The Mattermost login screen will appear. Connect yourself with the user you have created during the initial setup of the application.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-mattermost-login.webp" alt="" />
2. Once logged in click the menu button, then on **System Console** to enter the configuration interface of Mattermost.
3. Click **Configuration** in the general settings section.
4. Configure the **Listen Address** as **127.0.0.1:8065**.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-mattermost-listen-address.webp" alt="" />

  This prevents direct connections to Mattermost from other machines.
5. Restart the Mattermost service.
    ```
    systemctl restart mattermost.service
    ```
6. Reload the Mattermost application in your browser.

You may configure advanced settings, like email notifications and other customizations of your Mattermost application. For more information, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/).
