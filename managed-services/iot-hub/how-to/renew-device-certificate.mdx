<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created an IoT Hub](/managed-services/iot-hub/how-to/create-hub)
  - You have [added a device](/managed-services/iot-hub/how-to/add-device)
</Message>

<Message type="important">
  The renewal feature becomes unavailable once you have provided your own hub Certificate Authority or previously replaced the device certificate since, in this case, the certificate authority is no longer managed by Scaleway.

  The validity period of certificates generated by Scaleway is 10 years.
