This page shows you how to deploy a [function](/serverless-functions/concepts/#function) using the Scaleway console.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [functions namespace](/serverless-functions/how-to/create-manage-delete-functions-namespace/)

## How to create a function

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.

2. Click the functions namespace in which you want to create your function.

3. Click **+ Create function**. The function creation wizard displays.

### Function configuration

1. Select a runtime for your function.

2. Select a function code option:

    - **Inline code editor** to enter your own function code.
    
    - **Deploy "Hello world"** to deploy a basic function that will return "Hello world" when invoked. This option allows you to quickly test a deployment.

    - **Upload a ZIP** to import a [packaged function](/serverless-functions/how-to/package-function-dependencies-in-zip/).

3. If you used the code editor, enter the [handler](/serverless-functions/reference-content/functions-handlers/) of your function.

4. Enter a **name** or use the automatically generated one. The name can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes. You can click the icon at the right to generate a random name for your function.

5. Enter an optional **description** for your function.

### Function resources and scaling

1. Select the **resources** to allocate to your function.

2. Configure the **scaling** of your function.

      Define a minimum of **one instance** or more to avoid cold starts.
    </Message>

### Function advanced options (optional)

1. Click **+ Advanced options**.

2. Define any **environment variables** you want to inject into your function. For each environment variable, click **+ Add variable** and enter the key/value pair.

3. Define any **Secrets** you want to inject into your function. For each secret, click **+ Add secret** and enter the key/value pair. Secrets are environment variables which are injected into your function and stored securely, but not displayed in the console after initial validation.
        <Message type="note">
        Encode your environment variables and secrets to `base64` if they are too large, and contain carriage returns.

4. Set the desired **privacy policy** for your function. This defines whether a function can be executed anonymously (**public**) or only via an authentication mechanism provided by the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-functions/#authentication) (**private**).

5. Set the desired timeout for your function.

6. Choose the desired **Sandbox** environment for your function.

      [Triggers](/serverless-functions/concepts/#trigger) can no longer be added from this screen. For more information, refer to the [How to add a trigger to a function](/serverless-functions/how-to/add-trigger-to-a-function/) documentation.
    </Message>

### Function cost and validation

1. Update the **Number of requests** and **Average request duration** fields to simulate the behavior of your function.

2. Verify the **estimated cost**. Refer to the [Serverless Functions pricing](/faq/serverless-functions/#how-am-i-billed-for-serverless-functions) for more information on how billing works.

3. Click **Create function** to finish.

  There are different ways to deploy Serverless Functions. Refer to our detailed [deployment information](/serverless-functions/reference-content/deploy-function/) for more advanced options to deploy your functions.
