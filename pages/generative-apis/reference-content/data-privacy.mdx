This Privacy Policy outlines how Scaleway ("we," "us," or "our") processes personal data when you use our AI services (hereinafter "Generative APIs"). This policy supplements the Scaleway [General Privacy Policy](https://www.scaleway.com/en/privacy-policy/). 
Any terms defined in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU Regulation 2016/679) or our [General Privacy Policy](https://www.scaleway.com/en/privacy-policy/) have the same meaning here.

Generative APIs comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), ensuring that all personal data is processed in accordance with European Union laws. This includes implementing strong data protection measures, maintaining transparency in data processing activities, and ensuring customers’ rights are upheld.

## 1. Data Processor

The data processor for the Generative APIs service is Scaleway, with its registered office at 8 RUE DE LA VILLE L'EVÊQUE 75008 PARIS 8. We collect and process your personal data strictly to provide access and functionality to AI services.

## 2. Data collection and processing

We collect and process the following categories of data:

- Account information: To access Generative APIs, you must create a customer account. We collect identifying personal data (e.g., name, email) to manage your account and API access.

    - API request metadata (HTTP calls, status codes, timestamps, etc.)
    - Token counts (input/output specific to large language models (LLMs), without prompt details)
    - Parameters defined by the user, **excluding the actual content of the prompts (system, user, etc.)**

Only in the event of misuse harming the service functionnality (such as specific customer requests generating errors or carrying out malicious activity), we may store temporarily and access full content of HTTP requests of this customer, to identify a root cause issue or any security vulnerability.

<Message type="note">
- We do not collect, read, reuse, or analyze the content of your inputs, prompts, or outputs generated by the API. The only exception being when your traffic harms our service operations such as generating abnormal errors - like HTTP 500 errors - or may represent malicious activity. In this case, we may store temporarily the corresponding HTTP request content to identify and fix root cause issues or any security vulnerability.
- Your data is not accessible to other Scaleway customers.
- Your data is not accessible to the creators of the underlying large language models (LLMs).
- Your data is not accessible to third-party products, or services.
