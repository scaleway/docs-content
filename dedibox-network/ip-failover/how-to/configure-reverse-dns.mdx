Failover IP addresses allow to have several IPs on the server and thus, for example, to have one IP for each website or for each virtual machine.
Your IP failover can be routed at any time to your servers in just a few minutes by using our Account Management Console or through our API. By switching your failover IP addresses from one server to another, the hosted services remain available without reconfiguring the IP address.

For each server, you can add failover IP address(es) according to the offer and your service level.
