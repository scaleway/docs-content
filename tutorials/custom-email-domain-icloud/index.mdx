iCloud is Apple's service that allows you to securely store and manage your data across the entire Apple ecosystem.

While it is most commonly used for the storage of photos or the backup of devices in the cloud, an iCloud+ feature correctly named **Custom Email Domain** allows you to set up an email address with your own domain.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- An iCloud account upgraded with [iCloud+ premium features](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108047)
- [Configured a domain name](/domains-and-dns/quickstart/)
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization


## Adding the domain on iCloud

1. Log into your [iCloud account](https://www.icloud.com/)
2. Click the button that looks like a grid, next to your avatar, in the navbar at the top of the page. A menu displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-icloud-nav.webp" alt="" />
3. Click **Custom Email Domain**. A new page with a form displays.
    <Message type="requirement">
      If you do not have **Custom Email Domain** or are unable to proceed further, please verify that your iCloud account has access to iCloud+ premium features.
    </Message>

4. Click **Add a domain you own**.
5. Select **Only You**.
6. Type the domain you own and that you want to use for your email address. For example, if you want your email address to look like `me@mysuperdomain.com`, type `mysuperdomain.com`. A multi-steps instruction displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-icloud-own-domain.webp" alt="" />
7. Choose **No email addresses** at step 2.
8. Click **View** at step 3. The list of your domain's records displays. Keep this page open since you will need to copy them into your own domain's records in Scaleway DNS.

## Configuring the domain's records on Scaleway DNS

1. Log into the **Scaleway console**
2. Click **Domains and DNS** in the menu on the left. The list of your domains displays.
3. Select your domain, then select **DNS Zone** and finally **Root zone**.
4. Click **Add Records**. We will add all records provided by iCloud. Please note that adding all records is mandatory for the setup to work.

  While we provide examples to help understand where each value goes, we strongly recommend to copying exactly the value provided by iCloud, including punctuations and/or symbols.

## Verifying domain's records on iCloud

1. Go back to your iCloud account.
2. Select **Finish setup** at step 4. Click **Confirm**.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-icloud-finish-setup.webp" alt="" />

    <Message type="note">
      It may take some time for the records to propagate across the network. You can try the **Finish setup** step again later. You can also use the `dig` command in your terminal to check if the domain's records are accessible.
    </Message>

    <Message type="important">
      If you encounter an error with a record, please double-check that you have entered the exact values from iCloud to your domain's records in Scaleway DNS.
