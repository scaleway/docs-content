The newest release of the Windows 2022 server and Windows 2022 core images now have the OpenSSH Server and OpenSSH Client packages installed by default.

The OpenSSH Server is installed and disabled by default for security purposes. It can be enabled at instance creation time by adding the tag `with-ssh` to the instance when it is created.

This is an example of a CLI command to start a server with OpenSSH Server enabled :
```
scw instance server create name=win2k22-core image=windows-server-2022-core tags.0=with-ssh type=POP2-2C-8G-WIN admin-password-encryption-ssh-key-id={ssh_key_id}
```
If your instance has been started without the tag and you want to enable OpenSSH Server, simply use the following Powershell command :

```
Start-Service sshd
```
You will then need to load the ssh keys configured in your project by using the ScalewayEcosystem command :
```
PS C:\Users\administrator> Scw-Fetch-SSH-Keys
