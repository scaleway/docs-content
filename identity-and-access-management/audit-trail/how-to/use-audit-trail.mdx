4. Click the **Project** drop-down and select the Scaleway Project containing the resources you want to track.
5. Click the **Method** drop-down and select the API method you want to track events for.

7. Optionally, click **Reset** to reset the filter.

    <Message type="tip">
     If no events display after you use the filter, check the [dedicated troubleshooting page](/identity-and-access-management/audit-trail/troubleshooting/cannot-see-events/) to solve the issue.
