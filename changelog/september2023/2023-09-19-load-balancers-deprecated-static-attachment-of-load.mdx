With the release of [VPCs](/network/vpc/concepts/#vpc) and their managed [DHCP](/network/vpc/concepts/#dhcp) feature, we are reworking the way resources are attached to a Private Network, in order to offer a bullet-proof experience. To this end, the **static attachment mode** that allowed for manual configuration of an IP address when attaching a Load Balancer to a Private Network from the Scaleway console, is no longer available. This mode is not in line with the all-new Private Network management engine Scaleway is working on, and could result in non working configurations. In removing static attachment mode, we are encouraging adoption of best practices that will future-proof your architectures. Simultaneously, we are also working on a set of new features to manage your IP addressing space more granularly.

While the feature will no longer be available from the Scaleway console, it is still available in the API, though entering a deprecation cycle.
