The cache feature allows you to cache your origin's content with Edge Services. This means that content can be served directly to users from Edge Services' servers, instead of from your Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer origin, enhancing performance.

You can disable and enable caching at will, as well as control the lifetime of an object in the cache. You can also purge your entire cache, or specific objects within it. A log is displayed to help you track your purge events.

## How to enable the cache

1. In the Scaleway console, navigate to the Edge Services dashboard for the Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer origin for which you want to enable caching:

    TODO INSERT SCREENSHOT

2. In the **Cache** panel, use the <Icon name="toggle" /> icon to enable the cache.

    The **Lifetime** configuration box displays. This enables you to define, in seconds, how long an object can be stored in the cache before it must be retrieved freshly from the origin (Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer).

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-services-cache.webp" /> TODO CHECK

    <Message type="tip">
    As an example, a value of 0 means that objects will not be cached, unless they have a separately-defined caching directive. Note that in any case, if an object has a caching directive, the caching directive always takes precedence over any lifetime setting defined here in Edge Services.
    </Message>

3. Leave the default value of 1 hour in place, or enter another value.

The cache is now enabled.

## How to purge all objects from your cache

This clears all objects from your cache. Afterward, Edge Services will retrieve fresh copies from the origin (Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer) before it stores them again in the cache.

1. In the Scaleway console, navigate to the Edge Services dashboard for the Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer origin whose cache you want to purge:

    TODO INSERT SCREENSHOT

2. In the **Purge cache** panel, click **Purge all**.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-services-purge-cache.webp" /> TODO CHECK

    A screen displays, warning you that your cache will be emptied, and Edge Services will have to retrieve objects from your origin before re-caching them.
        
3. Click **Purge cache** to confirm.

## How to purge specific objects from your cache

This allows you to specify the precise objects that you want to clear from the cache. Afterward, Edge Services will retrieve fresh copies from the origin (Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer) before it stores them again in the cache.

1. In the Scaleway console, navigate to the Edge Services dashboard for the Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer origin whose cache you want to purge:

    TODO INSERT SCREENSHOT

2. In the **Purge cache** panel, click **Purge by object**.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-services-purge-cache.webp" /> TODO CHECK
        
    A screen displays prompting you to enter the path of each object you want to purge from the cache.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-services-purge-object.webp" /> TODO CHECK

3. Enter the path of each object you want to purge. You can purge a maximum of 5 objects at a time.

      <Message type="tip">

      The path for each object should be defined from the root and must start with a slash, e.g. `/videos/my-video.mp4`.

      You **cannot** purge entire directories by simply specifying the path to the directory, e.g. `/videos`. Purging objects must be done strictly object-by-object, so `/videos/my-video1.mp4`, `/videos/my-video2.mp4`, `/videos/my-video3.mp4` etc. Watch this space for updates to this feature in the future.

      For example, if we imagine a Object Storage bucket containing one file at the root level called `object1.jpg`, and a subfolder at root level called `videos` containing an item called `my-video.mp4`, we would enter the object paths as follows:

      - `/object1.jpg`
      - `/videos/my-video.mp4`

      </Message>

4. Click **Purge objects from cache**.

    The specified objects are purged from your cache and you are returned to the Edge Services dashboard.

## How to disable your cache

1. In the Scaleway console, navigate to the Edge Services dashboard for the Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer origin whose cache you want to disable:

    TODO INSERT SCREENSHOT

2. In the **Cache** panel, use the <Icon name="toggle" /> icon to disable the cache.

    A pop-up displays, asking you to confirm the action.

3. Click **Disable cache**.

    Your cache is purged and disabled. Edge Services will now serve content by fetching it from your origin (Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer) directly. If you reenable your cache at a later point, you will begin with an empty cache.
