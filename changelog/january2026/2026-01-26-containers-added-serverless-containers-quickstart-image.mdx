To enable quick testing of Serverless Containers, we've added the **Quickstart image** option, which deploys a sample image to help you test the service. 

Additionally, several minor improvements have been made for a better user experience: 
- From the Serverless Container list in namespaces, you can now directly access the Logs and Metrics of a container  
- Creation and last edit dates are now displayed in the overview  
- Fixed an issue when deploying Serverless Containers from the Container Registry
