<Message type="important">
This document refers to the **routing** feature which is currently in public beta. Routing can only be activated when you create a new VPC. It cannot yet be activated on pre-existing VPCs.
</Message>

Routing is used to manage and control the flow of traffic within a VPC. It tells the VPC where to send traffic trying to get to a specific destination IP address. Notably, it allows traffic to be automatically routed between resources on different Private Networks within the VPC.

Currently, only auto-created routes are available, which are fully managed by Scaleway. Two types of managed route exist:
- **Local subnet route**: Generated when you create a Private Network in a VPC. Allows traffic to be routed between different Private Networks in the VPC.
- **Default route to internet**: Generated when you attach a Public Gateway to a Private Network in the VPC, and set it to advertise a default route. Allows traffic to be routed to addresses outside the VPC (i.e. the public internet) via the gateway.

The creation of custom routes will be possible in the future.

## How to activate routing on a VPC

You must create a new VPC in order to activate routing. It is not yet possible to activate routing on pre-existing VPCs.

1. Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the side menu. The list of your VPCs displays.

2. Click **+ Create VPC**. The VPC creation wizard displays.

    <Lightbox src="TODO SCREENSHOT THAT INCLUDES CONFIGURE OPTIONS" alt="" />

3. Choose a **region** for your VPC, and enter a **name** and (optionally) **tags**.

4. Under **Configure options**, slide the toggle to activate routing.

    Routing cannot be deactivated after creation of the VPC.

5. Click **Create VPC** to finish.

    The VPC is created.

## How to access and read the route table

Once you have created a new VPC and activated routing on it, a **Routing** tab is created for that VPC. This is where your VPC's **route table** can be found. The route table shows all the existing routes for the VPC.

1. Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the side menu. The list of your VPCs displays.

2. Click the VPC on which you have activated routing.

3. Click the **Routing** tab.

    If you have not yet created any Private Networks in the VPC, the route table will be empty. Routes are automatically generated and added to the route table when you either:
    
    - Create a Private Network in the VPC (this generates a **local subnet route**, which allows the VPC to route traffic between Private Networks), or 
    - Attach a Public Gateway to a Private Network and set it to advertise a default route. (this generates a **default route to the internet**) 
    
    When your route table starts to populate, it will look something like this:

    <Lightbox src="TODO SCREENSHOT OF ROUTE TABLE" alt="" />

    For help with understanding the route table and how to read it, [read more about route tables](/network/). Note that it is not currently possible to create your own custom routes, but this feature will be coming soon.

    As all routes are currently managed by Scaleway, you do not need to take any action with your route table. If and when you delete Private Networks from the VPC, or delete a Public Gateway advertising the default route, these routes will be automatically deleted from your route table.

### How to view VPC routes in IPV6 

Scaleway VPC routing supports both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. Managed routes to Private Networks and Public Gateways are simultaneously generated for both IPV4 and IPV6, and both are added to the route table. Use the toggle above the route table to switch from the default view of **IPV4** routes, to a view of **IPV6** routes.
