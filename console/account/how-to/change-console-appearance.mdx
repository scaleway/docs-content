You can choose the color scheme of the [Scaleway console](/console/account/concepts/#console) according to your preferences. We offer a light, dark, darker, or system-based color scheme.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

1. Click on your name in the top right corner of the Scaleway console. A pop-up menu opens.

2. Click **Profile** to view your Scaleway user profile.

3. Scroll to the **Appearance** section and select the color scheme for your Scaleway console. You can choose from four options:
    * A light color scheme
    * A dark color scheme
    * A darker color scheme
    * A color scheme based on your system preferences

    Your selection is saved automatically once you have chosen a color scheme.
