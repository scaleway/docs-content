title: Kubernetes Kapsule and Kosmos now support custom security groups
status: added
date: 2025-06-25
category: containers
product: kubernetes

Starting now, users can provide a security group ID for their existing security groups when creating a Kapsule pool.
If no security group ID is provided, the pool will use a default preconfigured security group named _Kapsule default security group_, which is shared among all Kapsule pools in the same zone.
The older behavior of creating a separate security group for each zone where the cluster had at least one pool has been discontinued.
