### Add your credit card
Enter your credit card information, then click **Add credit card**. We will send you an authorization charge of €1, which will be automatically reimbursed within two days. A [3D Secure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-D_Secure) validation is initiated. Depending on your bank, you may be asked to enter a code received by SMS or to confirm via an application on your smartphone.
Note that prepaid cards and some virtual cards are not accepted as a payment method.

### Validate your credit card
<Message type="note">
  This step is necessary for security purposes, but does not prevent you from using Scaleway resources. **You have 10 days to validate your credit card** once it's added.
