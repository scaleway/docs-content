  This page concerns the **VPC** / **regional Private Networks** product currently in [Public Beta](https://www.scaleway.com/en/betas/#regional-private-network). If you're looking for documentation about Public Gateways, see the [relocated concepts page](/network/public-gateways/concepts/) for that product.

## Regions and Availability Zones

Regions and Availability Zones (AZ) both refer to the geographical location in which a resource is created. Scaleway currently operates three regions, each of which has multiple AZs within it. Note that not all products are available in all regions/AZs. VPC is currently only available in the **France - Paris** region.

| Region                                   | Availability Zones                  |
|------------------------------------------| ----------------------------------  |
| France - Paris  `PAR`                    | `fr-par-1` `fr-par-2` `fr-par-3`    |
| The Netherlands - Amsterdam `AMS`        | `nl-ams-1` `nl-ams-2`               |
| Poland - Warsaw   `WAW`                  | `pl-waw-1` `pl-waw-2`               |

## Regional Private Networks

While Scaleway's original [Private Networks](/network/public-gateways/how-to/use-private-networks/) product offers connectivity of your resources within a single [Availability Zone](#regions-and-availability-zones) (AZ), regional Private Networks let you connect resources across multiple AZs within the same region. Regional Private Networks are currently only available for the **France - Paris** region, providing a dedicated, private and flexible L2 network to which you can attach your Scaleway resources.

You can also opt to attach a [Public Gateway](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#public-gateway) to your regional Private Networks to provide extra functionality, including DHCP to dynamically assign IP address to resources in the network, and NAT. Each resource and Public Gateway can be connected to up to eight regional Private Networks, letting you build your own network topologies. A new network interface with a unique media access control address (MAC address) is configured on each resource in a Private Network.

Read our dedicated documentation on [creating a regional Private Network](/network/vpc/how-to/create-private-network/).

## VPC

VPC is a set of products and features allowing you to build your own **V**irtual **P**rivate **C**loud on top of Scaleway's shared public cloud. This keeps your Scaleway resources secure and isolated, away from the public Internet.

One default VPC for every available region is automatically created in each Scaleway [Project](/console/my-project/concepts/#project). Currently VPC is only available for the Paris region.

VPC currently comprises the [regional Private Networks](#regional-private-networks) product. Layer 2 regional Private Networks sit inside the layer 3 VPC.
