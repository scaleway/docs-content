In the context of Kubernetes, a "Node image" typically refers to the operating system image that is used to create the worker nodes in a Kubernetes cluster.
A Kubernetes cluster consists of a main node (control plane) and multiple worker nodes. These worker nodes are where the actual containers run.

Each worker node in a Kubernetes cluster runs a container runtime (such as `containerd`) to manage and execute containers.
