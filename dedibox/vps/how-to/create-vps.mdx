A Dedibox VPS (Virtual Private Server) is a private virtualized server that operates within a larger physical infrastructure.
It provides directly accessible computing resources and greater control of your hosting environment than shared hosting solutions.

VPS are suitable for various use cases, including hosting websites, web applications, databases, development environments, etc. They balance performance, control, and affordability for businesses and individuals with moderate to high-traffic websites or applications.
