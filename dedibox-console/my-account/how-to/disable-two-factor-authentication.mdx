## How to restore access to your account

If you have lost both your 2FA App and backup codes, regaining access to your account will be hard. 
You will need to go through a manual identity verification process.

The only way to regain access to your account is to contact our support team with the following information:
  * Email address
  * Postal address
  * Two different documents proving your identity (passport or local ID card for individual accounts + certificate of incorporation for companies)
  * A phone number to contact you on
  * A copy of your last Online bill, or details about the amount charged if you don't have a copy
  * A card statement showing the Online by Scaleway bill debit


Once you have collected all this information, send them toÂ [document@scaleway.com](mailto:document@scaleway.com).
