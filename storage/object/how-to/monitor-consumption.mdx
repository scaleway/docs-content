You can view your Object Storage's metrics and logs using [Scaleway Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/quickstart/). Scaleway Object Storage is fully integrated into Cockpit, and allows you to monitor your objects, storage usage, and bandwidth at a glance. This page explains how to get started with Scaleway Cockpit for viewing your Object Storage metrics and logs.

Cockpit is available in all [regions](/storage/object/concepts/#region-and-availability-zone) for Object Storage.

</Message>

## How to activate your Cockpit

Scaleway Cockpit is deactivated by default, but you can [read our documentation](/observability/cockpit/how-to/activate-cockpit/) to activate it in a few steps.

## How to access the Grafana dashboard

To view your Object Storage metrics and logs, use the Grafana dashboard, which is accessible from the Scaleway console:
  - First you must create a user and their associated credentials (a username and password) for Grafana.
  - Then use these credentials to access the Grafana dashboard for all your Scaleway products via the Scaleway console.

1. Create a Grafana user and [retrieve your username and password](/observability/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/).

2. From the Scaleway console [Cockpit overview page](https://console.scaleway.com/cockpit/overview), click **Open dashboards** in the top right corner.

3. Enter your Grafana username and password to log in.

    You are directed to the Scaleway Cockpit dashboards homepage.

4. From the **Scaleway Dashboards** panel, select:
  - the **Object Storage Overview** dashboard to access your metrics.
  - the **Object Storage Logs Overview** dashboard to access your logs.

    You are directed to the selected dashboard. You can use the filters in the top left corner of the page to refine your metrics and logs.

<Message type="note">
  Your Object Storage metrics and logs dashboards are also accessible from the console via the **Metrics** and **Logs** tabs of a bucket.
