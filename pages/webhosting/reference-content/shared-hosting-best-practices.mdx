Your Web Hosting plan is on a shared server, meaning multiple websites are hosted on the same physical machine. While we have strong protections in place to isolate client environments, you are still responsible for some configurations.

This page teaches you about security best practices and how to secure your space properly.

## General best practices

- Choose a strong password for your account and update it regularly
- Use unique usernames and passwords for each account and service
- Subscribe to the hosting daily backup option to prevent loss in case of technical issues
- Use the security features provided by your control panel, such as SSL/TLS certificates
- Keep your software and plugins up-to-date for the highest level of security
- Enable the two-factor authentication feature provided by cPanel
- Limit access to files and databases to prevent abuses
- Contact our support team if you have any questions or issues

## Dedicated IP addresses

By default, your hosting plan uses a shared IP address, meaning that the same IP is used by multiple clients on the same server. In case of abuse (if another client sends spam, for example), the shared IP can be blacklisted by other providers, which can block all data coming from the server, thus preventing outgoing mail from being sent.

To avoid this, Scaleway offers a dedicated IP option:

- You get a unique IP address used only by your hosting
- You control your own reputation (especially for email delivery)

## File and folder permission settings

You can also keep your website secure by correctly setting file and folder permissions.

### Standard files

File permissions for files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc. should all be set to `644`. A permission of `644` means that the owner of the file will read and write permissions, while other users will only have read permissions.

### Folders

Permissions for folders should be set at `755`, meaning that the owner of the file has every right on the folder, while other users can only read and execute the folder but not alter it.

### Sensitive files

Sensitive files such as configuration files (`.env` files, or `wp-config.php` files for WordPress) should only be accessible by the owner. As such, they should be set to permissions `600`.

### PHP scripts

It is recommended to set PHP scripts to the `755` permissions. In some cases, `744` can be used to restrict execution to the owner of the script only.

  It is essential to review these permissions regularly to make sure that your hosting is not accessible to other users, and has not been compromised.
