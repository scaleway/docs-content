This page shows you how to create your first Serverless Containers namespace. [Namespaces](/compute/containers/concepts/#namespace) allow you to group your containers and share environment variables between them.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
</Message>

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The list of your containers displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-containers-creation.webp" alt="" />
2. Click **Create a namespace**. The containers namespace creation wizard displays.
3. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 
    - Enter a **name** and optionally a **description** for your namespace. The name must only contain alphanumeric characters.
    - Choose a **region**, which is the geographical location in which your namespace will be deployed.
    - Enter any **environment variables** required for your namespace. Environment variables configured in a namespace will be available in all containers/apps within the same namespace. For each environment variable, click **+Add** and enter the key / value pair.
    - Set secret environment variables (optional). **Secrets** are environment variables which are injected into your container and stored securely, but not displayed in the console after initial validation. Add a **key** and a **value**.
    - Verify the **estimated cost**.
4. Click **Create a namespace** to finish.

Your namespace is now created and you are taken to its **Containers** tab.
