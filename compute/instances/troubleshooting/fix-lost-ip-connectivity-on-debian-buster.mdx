On older Debian Buster images, the installed custom version of `cloud-init` may interfere with the IPv6 connectivity when the Instance has been transitioned to use routed IP. This may be avoided by installing a newer version of cloud-init prior to the migration to routed IP. The procedure is also valid to recover connectivity for an Instance already using routed IP.
The procedure to install the newer `cloud-init` is as follow :

* Install the new `debian-stable` PPA
```
rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/scaleway-ubuntu-stable-bionic.list
add-apt-repository ppa:scaleway/debian-staging
vi /etc/apt/sources.list.d/scaleway-ubuntu-debian-staging-noble.list
Replace `noble` by `bionic`
```
The URL of the PPA may be configured to use the `noble` serie. This must be change to `bionic` if it is the case. Following this change, a new version of `scaleway-ecosystem` and `cloud-init` may be installed. It is important to clean the previous `cloud-init` data as the new version contains structure that may cause a failure of cloud-init at the next boot.
```
apt update
apt -y install scaleway-ecosystem cloud-init
cloud-init clean
```
The Instance requires to be rebooted for the fix to be active.
