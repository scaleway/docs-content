All Scaleway [GPU Instances](/compute/gpu/quickstart/) come with a Nvidia driver preinstalled. This means you do not have to install them by yourself.
The drivers installed on each Instance are from the `nividia-headless-<driver version>` packages. These are intended for use on Instances without a Windows Desktop or display server. 

<Message type="important">
    The manual installation of a `nvidia-driver` package forces the installation of the `xorg` display server and other Gnome packages. As there is no physical display connected to the GPU of your Instance, this may cause side effects such as your Instance entering into sleep mode after a while. The user will get disconnected as a result.

If you have `nvidia-driver-*` packages installed on your GPU Instance, remove them from the Instance using the `apt purge` command and make sure to install and use `nvidia-headless-*` packages instead.

<Message type="tip">
  If you want to use `ffmpeg` in a Docker container on your GPU-Instance, make sure to install the `libnvidia-encode` library corresponding to the driver version installed on your Instance.
  For example: `apt install -y libnvidia-encode-525`  (with GPU OS12).
  You also need to specify the driver capabilities to launch your containers (By default graphics and video are not enabled):
  ```
  docker run --rm --runtime=nvidia -e NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=graphics,video
  ```
