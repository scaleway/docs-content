The [secret](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#secret) creation process slightly differs depending on whether you are using Secret Manager for the first time or not. This page explains how to create a [secret](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#secret) for the first time using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) and how to create a secret if you have already created resources in Secret Manager.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

    3. Choose the [region](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#region) in which you want to create your secret.
          <Message type="important">
           Secrets cannot be moved from one region to another after creation.
          </Message>
    4. Create a [path](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#path) in which to store your secret. The path name **must be prefixed** with a slash.
    5. Enter a name for your secret and add optional tags.
    6. Add your secret manually or import it from a file.
          <Message type="note">
           The maximum file size for your secret is 64 KiB.
          </Message>
    7. Optionally, click <Icon name="toggle" /> to enable [secret protection](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#secret-protection).
    8. Optionally, click <Icon name="toggle" /> next to **Single access** or **Time to Live** to apply an [ephemeral policy](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#ephemeral-policy) to your secret and its versions.
          <Message type="important">
           - **Single access**: allows you to set your secret versions to **expire after one single access**.
           - **Time to Live**: allows you to set a time frame of up to one year, during which your secret versions are valid and accessible.
           - The ephemeral policy can only be applied to a secret at creation, and **cannot be removed** once applied.
           - Once applied to a secret, the ephemeral policy's settings will be applied to all the secret's versions, even those created subsequently.
