You can use the Scaleway CLI to create, export and import snapshots of your Instances. A snapshot is a [QCOW2 image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qcow) of your Instance's volumes, stored in a Scaleway Object Storage bucket. It can be imported into any Availability Zone, as long as it is in the same region as the bucket in which it is hosted.

## Creating a snapshot using the CLI 

To create a snapshot from a volume using the CLI, run the following command:
```
$ scw instance snapshot create [arg=value ...]
```

The following arguments and flags are available to customize your command:

```sh
ARGS:
  [name=<generated>]   Name of the snapshot
  [volume-id]          UUID of the volume
  [unified]            Whether a snapshot is unified or not.
  [tags.{index}]       The tags of the snapshot
  [project-id]         Project ID to use. If none is passed the default project ID will be used
  [bucket]             Bucket name for snapshot imports
  [key]                Object key for snapshot imports
  [size]               Imported snapshot size, must be a multiple of 512
  [organization-id]    Organization ID to use. If none is passed the default organization ID will be used
  [zone=fr-par-1]      Zone to target. If none is passed will use default zone from the config (fr-par-1 | fr-par-2 | fr-par-3 | nl-ams-1 | nl-ams-2 | pl-waw-1)

FLAGS:
  -h, --help   help for create
  -w, --wait   wait until the snapshot is ready

GLOBAL FLAGS:
  -c, --config string    The path to the config file
  -D, --debug            Enable debug mode
  -o, --output string    Output format: json or human, see 'scw help output' for more info (default "human")
  -p, --profile string   The config profile to use
```

## Creating a snapshot in the default zone from the given volume ID


To create a snapshot in the default zone from the given volume ID, run the following command. Remember to replace `11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111` with the actual ID of your volume. 

```
scw instance snapshot create volume-id=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
```

## Creating a snapshot in a specific zone from the given volume ID 

To create a snapshot in a specific zone (e.g. `fr-par-1`) from the given volume ID, run the following command. Remember to replace `11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111` with the actual ID of your volume. 
```
$ scw instance snapshot create zone=fr-par-1 volume-id=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
```

## Creating a named snapshot in the default zone from a given volume ID 

Run the following command to create a named snapshot from the given volume ID. Remember to replace `11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111` with the actual ID of your volume. 

```
$ scw instance snapshot create name=foobar volume-id=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
```

## Importing a QCOW file from an Object Storage bucket as Instance snapshot

Run the following command to import a QCOW file as an Instance snapshot. Replace the bucket name `my-bucket` with the name of your Object Storage bucket and the file name `qcow2-file-name.qcow2` with the name of your QCOW file. 
```
$ scw instance snapshot create zone=fr-par-1 name=my-imported-snapshot volume-type=unified bucket=my-bucket key=my-qcow2-file-name.qcow
```

<Message type="important">

When importing existing QCOW / QCOW2 files from Object Storage as Instance snapshots, make sure that the file has the suffix `.qcow` or `.qcow2`.
