## Cloud Essentials

Cloud Essentials aims to provide a vast range of technologies, with a focus on easy deployment and minimal feature set while offering production-ready stability and scalability.

## OpenSearch

OpenSearch is a distributed search and analytics engine that supports various use cases, from implementing a search box on a website to analyzing security data for threat detection. The term distributed means that you can run OpenSearch on multiple computers. Search and analytics means that you can search and analyze your data once you ingest it into OpenSearch. No matter your type of data, you can store and analyze it using OpenSearch.

## Document

A document is a unit that stores information (text or structured data). In OpenSearch, documents are stored in JSON format.

You can think of a document in several ways:

  - In a database of students, a document might represent one student.
  - When you search for information, OpenSearch returns documents related to your search.
  - A document represents a row in a traditional database.

For example, in a school database, a document can represent one student and contain the following data:

| ID     | Name     | GPA    | Graduation Year | 
|--------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| 1      | John Doe | 3.89   | 2022            |

Here is what this document looks like in JSON format:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "gpa": 3.89,
  "grad_year": 2022
}
```
Document IDs are assigned in indexing documents.

## Index

An index is a collection of documents.

You can think of an index in several ways:

  - In a database of students, an index represents all students in the database.
  - When you search for information, you query data contained in an index.
  - An index represents a database table in a traditional database.

For example, in a school database, an index might contain all students in the school.

  | ID     | Name         | GPA    | Graduation Year | 
  |--------|--------------|--------|-----------------|
  | 1      | John Doe     | 3.89   | 2022            |
  | 2      | Steve Powers | 3.85   | 2025            |
  | 3      | Jane Doe     | 3.52   | 2024            |
  | ...    |              |        |                 |
