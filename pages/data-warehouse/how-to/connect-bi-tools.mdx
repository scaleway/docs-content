ODBC connection between PowerBI and Data Warehouse for ClickHouse® is currently not supported.
</Message>

### Creating a dedicated MySQL user

1. [Connect to your deployment](/data-warehouse/how-to/connect-applications/).

2. Run the SQL query below to create a user with a plain text password. Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values:
    ```sql
    CREATE USER mysql_user IDENTIFIED WITH plaintext_password BY 'mysql_user_password';
    ```

    ```sql
    GRANT SELECT(id) ON my_database.my_table TO mysql_user WITH GRANT OPTION;
    ```

Your user can now access the specified database using the credentials you just defined.
