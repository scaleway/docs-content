The [RPN SAN](/dedibox-network/rpn/concepts/#rpn-san) is an iSCSI target, it is possible to mount it in Windows Server 2012 or later to use it as a normal disk in the system.

  <Message type="tip">
    For a 1 TB SAN, keep the default choice. If you have a larger SAN, select GPT, Windows can not handle partitions larger than 2 TB with anything except GPT.
  </Message>
6. Format the disk with a file system (NTFS). Click **Next** > **Finish** to confirm formatting the disk.

    Once finished formatting (in about 10 minutes using quick formatting), the hard disk drive should be accessible from the server manager as a regular disk:
