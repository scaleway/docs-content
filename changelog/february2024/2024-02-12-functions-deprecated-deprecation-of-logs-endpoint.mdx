Due to infrequent usage and changes affecting the storage of user logs, we are announcing the deprecation of the `/logs` endpoint (or `ListLogs` for our SDK users).
However, users can still access their function logs conveniently via their [Cockpit interface](/observability/cockpit/quickstart/). A dedicated dashboard called "Serverless Functions Logs" is accessible there. For detailed instructions, refer to our [documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-functions/#logs).
For users who are already using Cockpit for log access (logs have been directed to Cockpit for the past 6 months), there will be no disruption.
Note, the `/logs` endpoint will be fully deprecated in one month, effective March 12, 2024.
