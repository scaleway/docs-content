Scaleway [Elastic Metal servers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/elastic-metal/) provide on-demand dedicated servers similar to cloud instances. These servers are ideal for large workloads, big data, and applications requiring enhanced security and dedicated resources.

<Requirements />
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)

### Steps to create an Elastic Metal server

1. Go to **Elastic Metal** in the **Bare Metal** section of the [Scaleway console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements) side menu. The Elastic Metal server creation page displays.
2. Click **Create Elastic Metal server**. The server creation wizard will launch.
3. Complete the server creation wizard:
    - Select the geographical region for your server by choosing an Availability Zone.

        - Amsterdam, Netherlands (`AMS-1`, `AMS-2`)
        - Paris, France (`PAR-1`, `PAR-2`)
        - Warsaw, Poland (`WAW-2`, `WAW-3`)
      </Message>
    - Choose your preferred billing method: **hourly** or **monthly**.
      <Message type="tip">
        You can update the billing period to monthly at any time after your server has been delivered. [Learn more.](/elastic-metal/how-to/change-billing-period/)
      </Message>
    - Select a server configuration from the available options.
    - Choose an OS to run on your server or opt for no preinstalled image.
    - Configure server partitioning. You can either choose a default configuration or [configure your own partitioning](/elastic-metal/how-to/configure-disk-partitions/).
    - Enter a name and, optionally, add tags to identify your server.
    - Add your SSH key (required if installing an image on your server). Depending on the OS image, you may also be asked to configure the panel user for your server.
    - Optionally, configure the available public bandwidth for your server. This option may not be available for all offers.
    - Optionally, decide whether to enable the Private Networks feature. [Learn more about Private Networks](/vpc/concepts/#private-networks)
    - Review the estimated environmental footprint of your Elastic Metal server.

        For a detailed report of how the environmental impact of Scaleway services is calculated, refer to the [Environmental Footprint calculator breakdown](/environmental-footprint/additional-content/environmental-footprint-calculator) documentation page.

    - Review the estimated cost based on your selected configuration.

4. Click **Create Elastic Metal server** to finalize your order.

You can monitor the delivery progress from the list of Elastic Metal servers in the console.
