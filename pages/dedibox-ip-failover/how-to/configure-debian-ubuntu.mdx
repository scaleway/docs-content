This guide provides step-by-step instructions for configuring a Dedibox [failover IP](/dedibox-ip-failover/concepts/#failover-ips) on Debian and Ubuntu Linux. A failover IP is a secondary IP address that can be assigned to your server.

## Failover IP configuration on Debian

1. Connect to your server using SSH and open the network configuration file `/etc/network/interfaces` in a text editor, such as `nano`:
  ```bash
  nano /etc/network/interfaces
  ```
2. Add the failover IP to the configuration as shown in the following example:
  ```bash
  # This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
  # and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).
  # The loopback network interface
  auto lo
  iface lo inet loopback
  # The primary network interface
  auto eth0
  iface eth0 inet static
      address 195.154.123.123
      netmask 255.255.255.0
      gateway 195.154.123.1
  auto eth0:0
  iface eth0:0 inet static
      address ip_failover
      netmask 255.255.255.255
  ```
  <Message type="note">
    The interface name (`eth0` in this example) may vary depending on your OS version and system configuration. Use the `ifconfig` command to determine the name of your primary network interface.
  </Message>

3. Save the file and exit the editor. Bring up the interface using the following command:
  ```bash
  ifup eth0:0
  ```

## Failover IP configuration on Ubuntu (Netplan)

Since Ubuntu 18.04, Netplan has been the default network configuration system.

1. Disable cloud-init network configuration to prevent conflicts with Netplan:
  ```bash
  sudo mkdir -p /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d
  echo 'network: {config: disabled}' | sudo tee /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg
  ```
  <Message type="important">
    This step is necessary to prevent cloud-init from overriding the Netplan configuration.
  </Message>

2. Backup the existing Netplan configuration and create a new file:
  ```bash
  sudo cp /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml /etc/netplan/01-myplan.yaml
  sudo mv /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml-backup
  ```
4. Edit the new Netplan configuration file `/etc/netplan/01-myplan.yaml` using `nano`:
  ```yml
  network:
    renderer: networkd
    ethernets:
      enp5s0:
        critical: true
        dhcp-identifier: mac
        dhcp4: false
        dhcp6: false
        addresses:
          - 51.111.222.333/24  # Server main IP (/24)
          - 212.111.222.333/32  # Alternate IPs / IP redirects (/32)
          - 212.111.222.334/32
          - 212.111.222.335/32
        routes:
          - to: 0.0.0.0/0
            via: 62.210.0.1
            metric: 1
            on-link: true
        nameservers:
          addresses:
            - 51.159.69.156
            - 51.159.69.162
      enp6s0:
        dhcp4: true
        dhcp4-overrides:
          use-routes: false
        routes:
          - to: 10.88.0.0/13  # Use appropriate IP/gateway from DHCP
            via: 10.89.23.129
  version: 2
  ```
  <Message type="tip">
    Ensure that indentation and formatting are correct to avoid YAML syntax errors.
  </Message>

5. Run the following command to test the configuration:
  ```bash
  sudo netplan try
  ```
6. If everything works as expected, apply the configuration:
  ```bash
  sudo netplan apply
  ```
  <Message type="important">
    If there is an error in your configuration, it might render your network inaccessible. You may need to revert changes using [KVM/IPMI](/dedibox-kvm-over-ip/quickstart/) access.
  </Message>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your network configuration, check the logs using:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u systemd-networkd --no-pager
```
You can also refer to the [official Canonical repository](https://github.com/canonical/netplan/tree/main/examples) for more Netplan examples and troubleshooting guides.
