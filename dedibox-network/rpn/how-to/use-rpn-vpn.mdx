The RPN VPN service allows you to access machines inside your RPN from an external connection or from a Dedibox server having no RPN interface.
It is based on [OpenVPN](/tutorials/install-openvpn/) and you can add the RPN VPN to your RPNv1 group like any other server.

The RPN VPN service allows you to:

* Connect from anywhere in your totally secure and private network    
* Connect servers which do not have an RPN interface to the RPN

<Message type="requirement">

* You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net)
* You have an RPN-compatible Dedibox dedicated server
* You have installed an OpenVPN client on your local computer

## How to download the RPN VPN configuration

1. From the Dedibox Console, click on **RPN** in the menu on top of the page. Select **RPN VPN** to display a summary of your RPN VPN services.

    To use your RPN VPN in your RPNv1 group, you have to add it to your group as an RPN server. For more information follow our [RPN documentation](/dedibox-network/rpn/quickstart/).

### How to configure the Linux client

1.  Launch the installation of [OpenVPN](/tutorials/install-openvpn/) using the following command:

    ```
    root@mydedibox:~# apt install openvpn
    ```

2. Edit the client configuration file `/etc/openvpn/client.conf` in a text editor. For example with `nano`: 

    ```
    root@mydedibox:~# nano /etc/openvpn/client.conf
    ```
    
    The configuration file looks like the following example:

    ```
    client
    dev tun
    ;proto tcp
    proto udp
    float
    remote <IP of the RPN VPN server> 1194
    nobind
    persist-key
    persist-tun
    ca <ca.crt>
    cert <cert.crt>
    key <cert.key>
    askpass <password file>
    ns-cert-type server
    comp-lzo
    verb 3
    ```

    Set the following values in the configuration file:

    * `<IP of the RPN VPN server>`: IP of the RPN VPN server
    * `<ca.crt>`: Path to ca.crt
    * `<cert.crt>`: Path to the client .crt
    * `<cert.key>`: Path to the client .key
    * `<password file>`: Path to the file containing your password

    Then save the file and exit the text editor.

3. To start the VPN automatically during the boot process of the server, edit the file `/etc/default/openvpn` and insert the following line:

    ```
    AUTOSTART="client"
    ```

    This line allows [OpenVPN](/tutorials/install-openvpn/) to start automatically with the configuration file located at /etc/openvpn/client.conf

Once the connection to the RPN VPN server has been established, you may check whether you can see a new interface, using your RPN VPN IP:

    ```
    root@mydedibox:/etc/default# ifconfig tun0
    tun0      Link encap:UNSPEC  HWaddr 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00  
            inet addr:10.90.250.25  P-t-P:10.90.250.26  Mask:255.255.255.255
    ```

You can also check if the routes for the RPN network have been set:

    ```
    root@mydedibox:/etc/default# route -n | grep 10.90
    10.90.0.0       10.90.250.26    255.255.0.0     UG    0      0        0 tun0
    10.90.250.1     10.90.250.26    255.255.255.255 UGH   0      0        0 tun0
    10.90.250.26    0.0.0.0         255.255.255.255 UH    0      0        0 tun0
    ```

Now you can [configure your server](/dedibox-network/rpn/quickstart/) in your RPN group.
