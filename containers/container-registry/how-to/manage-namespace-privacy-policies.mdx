A namespace's privacy policy specifies whether everyone is granted access to pull its images or not. Everyone will be able to pull container images from a public namespace.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [Container Registry namespace](/container-registry/how-to/create-namespace/)
- An image [pushed](/container-registry/how-to/push-images/) to your namespace


1. Click **Container Registry** in the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Container Registry namespaces dashboard displays.
2. Click the namespace's name to list its images.
3. Click the **Namespace settings** tab, then configure the policy by selecting either **Public** or **Private**.

  Each container image may additionally have its [own privacy policies](/container-registry/how-to/manage-image-privacy-settings/).
