[Meilisearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/) is an open-source search engine that provides instant and relevant search results from large collections of data. Meilisearch is particularly useful for applications that require fast and efficient search capabilities, such as e-commerce sites, documentation search, and any platform where users need to quickly find relevant information from a large dataset.

This tutorial shows you how to deploy a Meilisearch search engine on a [Scaleway Instance](/compute/instances/).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) (specifically **InstancesFullAccess**) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An [Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) with the [Docker InstantApp](/compute/instances/reference-content/images-and-instantapps/#instantapps) or with the [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed


## Connecting to your Instance and starting Meilisearch

1. Open a terminal and connect to your Instance using [SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/). Replace `<INSTANCE_IP>` with your Instance's IP (Instances > Overview > Flexible IP > the first IP address that displays in the list).

    ```
    ssh root@<INSTANCE_IP>
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
     If you are using an Instance with a Docker InstantApp, run `docker -v` to make sure that the Docker engine is already installed. The current docker engine version should display.
    </Message>
2. In the same terminal, generate a master key for Meilisearch. This key will secure your Meilisearch instance.

    ```
    export MEILI_MASTER_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 16)
    ```
3. Run the following command to display the master key:

    ```
    echo $MEILI_MASTER_KEY
    ```
    <Message type="important">
     Copy and save your master key as you will need it in the next steps.
    </Message>
4. Run the MeiliSearch container using Docker. This command sets up Meilisearch to store data persistently on the volume located at `$(pwd)/meili_data:/meili_data` on your Instance.

    ```
    docker run -d -p 7700:7700 -v $(pwd)/meili_data:/meili_data  -e $MEILI_MASTER_KEY getmeili/meilisearch:v1.9
    ```
5. Check that the container is running:
    ```
    docker ps
    ```
    You should see an output similar to the following:
    ```
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                       COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                       NAMES
    0432254e4d64   getmeili/meilisearch:v1.9   "tini -- /bin/sh -c …"   56 minutes ago   Up 56 minutes   0.0.0.0:7700->7700/tcp, :::7700->7700/tcp   flamboyant_dewdney
    ```
    <Message type="tip">
     You can stop the Meilisearch container using `docker container stop <container_name>`.
    </Message>
6. Use the following command to check that Meilisearch is running.

    ```
    curl -X GET 'http://localhost:7700/version' -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$MEILI_MASTER_KEY
    ```

    You should see an output similar to the following:
    ```json
    {"commitSha":"0df84bbba7db46680e83843dd6454257161a282f","commitDate":"2024-06-27T12:47root@scwrororororrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrorrrorrrrrrrrrrrrroot@scw-lucid-satoshi:~#
    ```

## Accessing Meilisearch remotely

1. Open a new terminal and export your environment variables. Make sure that you replace `{INSTANCE_PUBLIC_DNS}` and `{MEILI_MASTER_KEY}` with your own variables.
    ```sh
     export INSTANCE_PUBLIC_DNS={INSTANCE_PUBLIC_DNS}
     export MEILI_MASTER_KEY={MEILI_MASTER_KEY}
    ```
    Your command should look like the following:
      ```
      export INSTANCE_PUBLIC_DNS=a3dc5b0e-5c5c-4ac4-91fb-1447b5c23b57.pub.instances.scw.cloud
      export MEILI_MASTER_KEY=LtRrsh68IdT2jKDH5DdXhA==
      ```
2. Run the following command to access Meilisearch remotely:
    ```sh
    curl -X GET 'http://'$INSTANCE_PUBLIC_DNS':7700/version' -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$MEILI_MASTER_KEY
    ```
  <Message type="tip">
   You can also open your browser at `http://{INSTANCE_PUBLIC_DNS}:7700/health` since you do not need an API key to access the `/health` endpoint.
  </Message>

If you have created your Instance within a **Private Network** or if you are using a specific **security group** configuration, you must allow TCP traffic on port `7700` for your Instance to access your Meilisearch container remotely. See [our dedicated documentation on how to use security groups](/compute/instances/how-to/use-security-groups/) and [how to configure a Public Gateway](/network/public-gateways/how-to/configure-a-public-gateway/) for more information.


## Creating an index and adding data to it

1. In the same terminal as the previous steps, paste the following command to create a new index named `movies`:
    ```sh
      curl -X POST 'http://'$INSTANCE_PUBLIC_DNS':7700/indexes' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$MEILI_MASTER_KEY \
      --data-binary '{
        "uid": "movies",
        "primaryKey": "id"
      }'
    ```

2. Add sample data to the `movies` index. In this case, we are adding 2 movies.
    ```sh
      curl -X POST 'http://'$INSTANCE_PUBLIC_DNS':7700/indexes/movies/documents' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$MEILI_MASTER_KEY \
      --data-binary '[
        {
          "id": 1,
          "title": "The Enigma of Elysia",
          "overview": "In a world where magic and technology coexist, a mysterious artifact known as the Elysia Stone is stolen from the royal palace."
        },
        {
          "id": 2,
          "title": "A Shattered Mirror",
          "overview": "In a world where dreams are reflected in a magical mirror, a young man named Orion discovers that his reflection has been shattered."
        }
      ]'
    ```
    An output similar to the following should display:
    ```
    {"taskUid":1,"indexUid":"movies","status":"enqueued","type":"documentAdditionOrUpdate","enqueuedAt":"2024-07-24T12:32:54.678571608Z"}root@scw-lucid-satoshi:~#
    ```

3. Search for the term `mystery` in the `movies` index:
    ```sh
      curl -X POST 'http://'$INSTANCE_PUBLIC_DNS':7700/indexes/movies/search' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$MEILI_MASTER_KEY \
    --data-binary '{ "q": "mystery" }'
    ```
    Documents containing the term (or close semantic variations of the term) should display in the output:
    ```json
    {"hits":[{"id":1,"title":"The Enigma of Elysia","overview":"In a world where magic and technology coexist, a mysterious artifact known as the Elysia Stone is stolen from the royal palace."}],"query":"mystery","processingTimeMs":4,"limit":20,"offset":0,"estimatedTotalHits":1}
    ```


### Going further

- Learn more about [Meilisearch APIs and features](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/reference/api/overview#parameters)

- **Secure** your deployment:
  - Encrypt traffic in transit to Meilisearch by [setting up SSL](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/configuration/instance_options#ssl-options)
  - Move your Instance inside a [Private Network](/compute/instances/how-to/use-private-networks/) if you do not want it to be exposed publicly on the internet
  - Configure regular data backups using [Meilisearch Snapshots](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/advanced/snapshots) or [Instances snapshots](/compute/instances/how-to/create-a-snapshot/)

- **Fine-tune deployment configuration** such as [Instances or disk size](/compute/instances/reference-content/choosing-instance-type/), from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers), [the Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/), [CLI](/compute/instances/api-cli/cli-cheatsheet/) or [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/scaleway/scaleway/latest/docs/resources/instance_server).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, check that you meet all the [requirements listed at the beginning of this page](#before-you-start). Also, verify that your Instance accepts connections from your computer. To do so, you can configure [security groups](/compute/instances/how-to/use-security-groups/) or a [Public Gateway](/network/public-gateways/how-to/configure-a-public-gateway/) to the [Private Network](/compute/instances/how-to/use-private-networks/) your Instance belongs to.
