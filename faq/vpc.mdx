## VPC

### What is the difference between VPC and a regional Private Network ?
One default VPC (**V**irtual **P**rivate **C**loud) for every available region is automatically created in each Scaleway [Project](/console/my-project/concepts/#project). A VPC offers layer 3 isolation. Currently, at Public Beta stage, VPC is only available for the Paris region.

A regional Private Network sits inside a VPC, and lets you connect resources across multiple AZs within the VPC's region, to a Private Network. This network offers layer 2 isolation. You can create multiple regional Private Networks within a VPC.

For now, VPC does not offer automation features, interconnection between different regional Private Networks or multiple layers per region. However, more features are planned in the future to enhance the VPC product.

### Can two different regional Private Networks communicate with each other?

No. A regional Private Network spans multiple AZs of the same region, but does not allow communication between two different regional Private Networks. In the future however, we plan to release a feature to enable this.

### Can I keep using my classic, mono-AZ Private Network?
While VPC/regional Private Networks are still in Public Beta, yes. However, for the future General Availablity of this product, mono-AZ Private Networks will be automatically migrated to regional Private Networks.

If you want to migrate an existing mono-AZ Private Network to regional now, [check out our dedicated documentation](/network/vpc/api-cli/vpc-private-beta/#migrating-existing-zonal-private-networks-to-regional-private-networks). Note that this can only be done via the API, not the console.

### What will happen to my current network configuration if I migrate my mono-AZ Private Network to regional Private Networks? 
The transition will be seamless, and you can keep using your existing network configuration. This can be even smoother if you use a Public Gateway with DHCP enabled on your regional Private Network.
