## Allowed IPs

Access control list (ACL) rules [define permissions for remote access to an Instance](/storage/database/how-to/manage-allowed-ip-addresses/). A rule consists of an IP address or an IP range.

</Concept>

## Clone feature

Allows you to create a full copy of your Database Instance (including users and permissions) at a point in time. This new Instance is fully independent of its parent.

</Concept>

## Database backup

A database backup is a complete dated export of a Database Instance stored on an offsite backup backend. Once a backup is [created](/storage/database/how-to/manage-manual-backups/), it can be used to fully restore the database.

</Concept>

## Database snapshot

A [Snapshot](/storage/database/how-to/manage-snapshots/) is a consistent, instantaneous copy of the Block Storage volume of your Database Instance at a certain point in time. They are designed to recover your data in case of failure or accidental alterations of the data by a user. They allow you to quickly create a new Instance from a previous state of your database, regardless of the size of the volume. Their limitation is that unlike Backups, Snapshots can only be stored in the same location as the original data.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Endpoint

A point of connection to a database. The endpoint is associated with an IPv4 address and a port, and contains the information of whether the endpoint is read-write or not.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Engine

A database engine is the software component that stores and retrieves your data from a database. Currently PostgreSQL version 9.6, 10, 11, 12 and 13 are available. MySQL is available in version 8.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## High availability

Is an option that allows you to create a secondary server, with an up-to-date replica of the database. If the primary server fails for any reason, the secondary can take over requests, reducing downtime.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Database Instance

A Database Instance is made up of multiple (at least 1) dedicated compute nodes, and is running a single Database Engine. Exactly one database engine is running on each node.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Managed database

Compared to traditional database management, which requires customers to provision their infrastructure and resources to manage their databases, managed databases offer the user access to a Database Instance without setting up the hardware or configuring the software.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Relational database

A database type that uses the relational model, which means that it stores and provides access to inter-related data points within the same database. Relational databases provide an intuitive, straightforward way of representing data in tables.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Region

A region is represented as a Geographical area such as France (Paris: `fr-par`), the Netherlands (Amsterdam: `nl-ams`) or Poland (Warsaw: `pl-waw`).

</Concept>
