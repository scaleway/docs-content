1. Go to the **AI & Data** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/), and select **LLM Inference** from the side menu to access the LLM Inference dashboard.
2. Click on **Create deployment** to launch the deployment creation wizard.
3. Provide the necessary information:
    - Select the desired model for your deployment from the available options:
        - Llama-2-70b
        - Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1
        - WizardLM-70b-V1.0

    - Choose the geographical **region** for the deployment.
    - Specify the GPU Instance type to be used with your deployment.
4. Enter a **name** for the deployment, along with an optional description and tags to aid in organization.
5. Configure the **network** settings for the deployment:
    - Enable **Private Network** for secure communication and restricted availability within Private Networks. Choose an existing Private Network from the drop-down list, if applicable.
    - Enable **Public Network** to access resources via the public IP address of the GPU Instance.
    <Message type="important">
      - Once configured, network settings cannot be modified after deployment creation. 
      - Enabling both private and public networks will result in two distinct endpoints (public and private) for your deployment.
