When you install your server with a virtualization solution like Proxmox, you can create multiple virtual machines on the physical server and configure them to use flexible IPv6 addresses.

This guide covers the steps for configuring the network interfaces on different distributions inside a virtual machine on a Proxmox host using flexible IPv6 addresses on Elastic Metal servers.

<Message type="tip">
  The DNS cache server (nameserver) may be different depending on the physical location of your server. Refer to our [network information documentation](/console/account/reference-content/scaleway-network-information/#dns-cache-servers) to find the IPv6 addresses to use with your machine.

- An [Elastic Metal server](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/create-server/) with a hypervisor (Proxmox) installed on it
- A [flexible IPv6](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/order-flexible-ip/)
- A [virtual MAC address](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/add-virtual-mac-address/)

## Finding your IPv6 gateway

1. Log into your virtual machine using SSH.

2. Identify your network interface:
   ```sh
   ip a
   ```
   Take note of your network interface name (e.g., `ens18`).

3. Find your IPv6 gateway:
   ```sh
   ip -6 route
   ```
   Look for the line that specifies the default route. It should look like the following:
   ```
   default via fe80::xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx dev ens18 proto static metric 1024 onlink
   ```
   The `fe80::xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx` part is your link-local IPv6 gateway address.

## Ubuntu - Configuration with Netplan

1. Open the Netplan configuration file:
    ```sh
    sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
    ```

2. Create the network configuration:
    ```yaml
    network:
      version: 2
      renderer: networkd
      ethernets:
        ens18:
          dhcp4: false
          dhcp6: false
          accept-ra: no
          addresses:
            - FLEXIBLE_IPv4/32
            - "FLEXIBLE_IPv6/64"
          routes:
            - to: 0.0.0.0/0
              via: 62.210.0.1
              on-link: true
            - to: "::/0"
              via: "LINK_LOCAL_IPv6_GATEWAY"
              on-link: true
          nameservers:
            addresses:
              - 51.159.47.28
              - 51.159.47.26
    ```
    Replace `FLEXIBLE_IPv4`, `FLEXIBLE_IPv6`, and `LINK_LOCAL_IPv6_GATEWAY` with your actual IP addresses.

3. Apply the configuration:
    ```sh
    sudo netplan apply
    ```

## Debian

1. Edit the network interfaces file:
    ```sh
    sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
    ```

2. Configure the network interface:
    ```sh
    auto ens18
    iface ens18 inet static
      address FLEXIBLE_IPv4
      netmask 255.255.255.255
      gateway 62.210.0.1
    iface ens18 inet6 static
      address FLEXIBLE_IPv6
      netmask 64
      gateway LINK_LOCAL_IPv6_GATEWAY
    ```
    Replace `FLEXIBLE_IPv4`, `FLEXIBLE_IPv6`, and `LINK_LOCAL_IPv6_GATEWAY` with your actual IP addresses.

3. Set the DNS resolver:
    ```sh
    sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
    ```
 4. Add the following lines, then save and exit the file.
    ```
    nameserver 51.159.47.28
    nameserver 51.159.47.26
    ```

5. Activate the network configuration:
    ```sh
    sudo ifup ens18
    ```

## CentOS

1. Edit the network script file:
    ```sh
    sudo nano /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ens18
    ```

2. Configure the network interface:
    ```
    DEVICE=ens18
    BOOTPROTO=none
    ONBOOT=yes
    USERCTL=no
    IPV6INIT=yes
    PEERDNS=yes
    TYPE=Ethernet
    NETMASK=255.255.255.255
    IPADDR=FLEXIBLE_IPv4
    IPV6ADDR=FLEXIBLE_IPv6
    GATEWAY=62.210.0.1
    DNS1=51.159.47.28
    DNS2=51.159.47.26
    ARP=yes
    HWADDR=virtual:mac:address
    ```
    Replace `FLEXIBLE_IPv4`, `FLEXIBLE_IPv6`, and `virtual:mac:address` with your actual IP addresses and MAC address.

3. Bring up the network interface:
    ```sh
    sudo ifup ens18
    ```

4. Find the IPv6 gateway:
   ```sh
   ip -6 route
   ```

## Debugging configuration issues

If your IPv6 configuration does not work as expected, follow these steps to troubleshoot:

1. Check the interface configuration:
   ```sh
   ip a
   ip route
   ip -6 route
   ```

2. Run a ping test:
   ```sh
   ping6 google.com
   ```

3. Check the DNS resolution:
   ```sh
   dig google.com
   dig -6 google.com
   ```

4. Review your network logs:
   ```sh
   sudo journalctl -u systemd-networkd
   ```

5. Restart network services:
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd
   ```
6. Verify the link-local address:
   ```sh
   ip -6 addr show dev ens18
   ping6 LINK_LOCAL_IPv6_GATEWAY
   ```
