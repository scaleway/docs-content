Edge Services is an additional feature for Scaleway Load Balancers and Object Storage buckets, currently available in [Public Beta](https://www.scaleway.com/en/betas/). It provides a [caching service](/network/edge-services/how-to/configure-cache/) to improve performance by reducing load on your [origin](#origin), and a customizable and secure [endpoint](#endpoint) for accessing content via Edge Services, which can be set to a subdomain of your choice.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created either a [Load Balancer](/network/load-balancer/how-to/create-load-balancer/) or an [Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)

## How to create an Edge Services pipeline

The process differs depending on whether you want to create a pipeline for an Object Storage bucket or a Load Balancer. Choose the correct tab for your case below. <br/><br/>

<Tabs id="edge-services-quickstart">
  <TabsTab label="Object Storage bucket">
  1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of your buckets displays.

  2. Click the name of the bucket you want to enable Edge Services on.

  3. Click the **Edge Services** tab.

      <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-services-splash.webp" alt="A screenshot of the Scaleway console shows the Edge Services tab for the selected bucket: it is in an empty state, with a button inviting you to enable Edge Services." />

  4. Click **Enable Edge Services for free**.

      A pop-up informs you that your bucket will be exposed via Edge Services and that you can disable Edge Services at any time. Edge Services is free during the beta stage, and you will be notified before it becomes billable.

  5. Click **Enable Edge Services** to confirm.

      Edge Services is enabled on your bucket, and a pipeline is automatically created. Various features are now visible on the Edge Services tab, ready to be configured.

      <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-services-dashboard.webp" alt="A screenshot of the Edge Services dashboard in the Scaleway console. This is a dashboard for Edge Services on an Object Storage bucket, showing links to the documentation, Scaleway Cockpit, the endpoint, cache settings and a button to disable the pipeline." />

      <Message type="important">

      For more detailed information about correctly enabling Edge Services in relation to bucket visibility, see the [dedicated documentation](/network/edge-services/how-to/create-pipeline-bucket/). You can also find out here how to access your bucket via Edge Services.
      </Message>
  </TabsTab>
  <TabsTab label="Load Balancer">
    1. Click **Load Balancers** in the **Network** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of your Load Balancers displays.

        <Lightbox src="scaleway-lb-edge-services.webp" alt="A screenshot of the Load Balancers dashboard in the Scaleway console. The Edge Services tab displays at the right." />

    2. Click the **Edge Services** tab.

    3. Click **create Edge Services pipeline**. The pipeline creation wizard displays.

        <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-es-pipeline-lb.webp" alt="A screenshot of the Create Edge Services Pipeline wizard in the Scaleway console. The steps shown are 1: Configure Origin, 2: Define protocol and origin host, and 3: Choose a name" />

    4. Configure the [origin](/network/edge-services/concepts/#origin) for this pipeline:
            - Select the **origin Load Balancer** from the dropdown list. The Edge Services pipeline will connect to this Load Balancer when requesting content.
            - Select a **frontend** associated with the origin Load Balancer from the dropdown list. The Edge Services pipeline will connect to the Load Balancer on this port when requesting content. We recommend that you select an HTTPS port, e.g. `443`. Note that if you are creating multiple pipelines for the same origin Load Balancer, each one must be configured for a different frontend.

            <Message type="tip">
            For Kubernetes Load Balancers, see our [dedicated documentation](/network/edge-services/how-to/create-pipeline-lb/#help-for-kubernetes-load-balancers) for help selecting the correct Load Balancer and frontend.

            </Message>

    5. Define the protocol and origin host for this pipeline:
            - Select the protocol that Edge Services should use when making requests to the origin, either `HTTP` or `HTTPS` (recommended). Choose the protocol that corresponds with your Load Balancer setup.
            - Optionally, enter an [origin host](/network/edge-services/concepts/#origin-host) associated with your Load Balancer for this pipeline. When specified, this host replaces the Load Balancer IP address in the HTTP Host Header of the requests made from Edge Services to your Load Balancer.

    6. Enter a name for this Edge Services pipeline, or leave the auto-generated name in place.

        Edge Services for Load Balancer is free during Public Beta. You will be notified before the service leaves beta and becomes billable.

    7. Click **Create Edge Services pipeline** to finish.

        Your pipeline is created and you are taken to its **Overview** page. The endpoint displays from which you can access your Load Balancer origin via Edge Services, e.g. `https://pipeline-id.edge.scw.cloud`.

      </TabsTab>
</Tabs>

## How to configure a custom domain

If you already own a domain, you can customize an Edge Services pipeline endpoint with a subdomain of your choice, e.g. `subdomain.mydomain.com`. This means you can access your Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer origin through Edge Services via your own subdomain rather than the standardized Edge Services endpoint.

1. In the Scaleway console, navigate to the Edge Services dashboard for the Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer origin whose domain you want to customize:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-services-dashboard.webp" alt="A screenshot of the Edge Services dashboard in the Scaleway console. This is a dashboard for Edge Services on an Object Storage bucket, showing links to the documentation, Scaleway Cockpit, the endpoint, cache settings and a button to disable the pipeline." />

2. In the **Endpoint** panel, click **Configure domain**. The following screen displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-configure-domain.webp" alt="A screenshot of the Configure Domain screen in the Edge Services part of the Scaleway console. Step one is to set a subdomain, step two is to provide an SSL/TLS certificate" />

3. Set a subdomain from which your Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer origin will be accessible via its Edge Services pipeline. You must already own the primary domain. For example, if you own `beautiful-domain.com`, choose any subdomain you like and enter `my-chosen-subdomain.beautiful-domain.com` into the box.

    <Message type="important">
    It is **not** possible to use only a root domain (aka primary domain or apex domain), you must use a subdomain. This is because CNAME records, essential to point your domain to your Edge Services endpoint, cannot by definition be created for root domains, only for subdomains.

4. This step depends on whether the domain used in the previous step is managed with [Scaleway Domains and DNS](/network/domains-and-dns/), or an external domain provider. Choose the appropriate tab below.

    <Tabs id="edge-cname">
    
        <TabsTab label="Domains and DNS">
        The domain you are using for Edge Services is considered to be managed with Scaleway Domains and DNS if:
        - You [registered the domain](/network/domains-and-dns/how-to/register-internal-domain/) with Domains and DNS, or
        - You [transferred an externally-registered domain](/network/domains-and-dns/how-to/transfer-external-domain/) to Domains and DNS

        If either of the above is true, Scaleway will auto-detect that the domain is managed by Domains and DNS, and a message will display confirming that you do not need to create a CNAME record. We will auto-generate the appropriate CNAME record in your domain's [DNS records](/network/domains-and-dns/how-to/manage-dns-records/), to point your subdomain to the Edge Services endpoint. This record is generated when you click `Customize domain` in step 6.

        You should not attempt to modify or delete the CNAME record, which will be visible among your [DNS records](/network/domains-and-dns/how-to/manage-dns-records/) in the Scaleway console.
        </TabsTab>

        <TabsTab label="External provider">
        Scaleway cannot itself create the appropriate CNAME record to point your subdomain to Edge Services if your domain is managed by an external provider. You must create the CNAME record yourself.

        Log in to your domain provider, and locate the DNS settings for your domain. Create a new CNAME record pointing your subdomain to the Edge Services pipeline endpoint displayed in the Scaleway console. For help setting up CNAME records and troubleshooting any problems, [check out our dedicated documentation](/network/edge-services/reference-content/cname-record/).

        Back in the Scaleway console, click the `Verify CNAME` button to check whether your CNAME record has been correctly configured. Edge Services will carry out a check, and if it is successful the following message displays:

        <Lightbox src="scaleway-cname-success.webp" alt="Verification passed: Your DNS record has been correctly configured" />

        If the check fails, an error message will display. See the documentation linked above for help troubleshooting such errors. Note that it may take a short time for the DNS record to be propagated and the check to pass.
        </TabsTab>
    </Tabs>

5. Provide an SSL/TLS certificate for your subdomain so that Edge Services can serve traffic for it over HTTPS. You have three options for this:
    - Generate a free Let's Encrypt certificate, managed by Scaleway, including automatic renewals.
    - Select an existing certificate that you have stored in [Scaleway Secret Manager](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/quickstart/).
    - Manually import a certificate into Scaleway Secret Manager:
      - Enter a name for your certificate (alphanumeric characters only)
      - Optionally, add tags by typing each tag and then pressing enter
      - Copy and paste the full PEM-formatted certificate chain into the box.
      Your certificate will be automatically stored in Secret Manager and [billed accordingly](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/security-and-account/).

    <Message type="tip">
    For help with SSL/TLS certificates for Edge Services, and/or dealing with any errors you encounter importing a certificate into Secret Manager, see our [dedicated documentation](/network/edge-services/reference-content/ssl-tls-certificate/).
    </Message>

6. Click **Customize domain** to finish.

Your customized domain is set up, and you are returned to the Edge Services dashboard. The customized domain displays in the Endpoint panel. When you access your Object Storage or Load Balancer origin through this domain, its content will be served via Edge Services.

## How to configure your cache

The cache feature allows you to cache your origin's content with Edge Services. This means that content can be served directly to users from Edge Services' servers, instead of from your Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer origin, enhancing performance.

You can disable and enable caching at will, as well as control the lifetime of an object in the cache. You can also purge your entire cache, or specific objects within it. A log is displayed to help you track your purge events.

1. In the Scaleway console, navigate to the Edge Services dashboard for the Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer origin for which you want to enable caching:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-services-dashboard.webp" alt="A screenshot of the Edge Services dashboard in the Scaleway console. This is a dashboard for Edge Services on an Object Storage bucket, showing links to the documentation, Scaleway Cockpit, the endpoint, cache settings and a button to disable the pipeline." />

2. In the **Cache** panel, use the <Icon name="toggle" /> icon to enable the cache.

    The **Lifetime** configuration box displays. This enables you to define, in seconds, how long an object can be stored in the cache before it must be retrieved freshly from the origin (Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer).

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-services-cache.webp" />

    <Message type="tip">
    As an example, a value of 0 means that objects will not be cached, unless they have a separately-defined caching directive. Note that in any case, if an object has a caching directive, the caching directive always takes precedence over any lifetime setting defined here in Edge Services.
    </Message>

3. Leave the default value of 1 hour in place, or enter another value.

The cache is now enabled.

For information on purging your cache, see our [dedicated documentation](/network/edge-services/how-to/configure-cache/).

## How to delete an Edge Services pipeline

You can delete an Edge Services pipeline at any time. Follow the steps below, depending on whether your pipeline is towards an Object Storage bucket origin or a Load Balancer origin. <br/><br/>

<Tabs id="edge-services-quickstart-delete">
  <TabsTab label="Object Storage bucket">
    1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of your buckets displays.

    2. Click the name of the bucket you want to disable Edge Services for.

    3. Click the **Edge Services** tab.

        <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-services-customised.webp" />

    4. In the **Disable Edge Services** panel at the bottom of the screen, click **Disable Edge Services**.

        A pop-up displays, informing you that the bucket will be removed from Edge Services.
          - The bucket will no longer be accessible via its Edge Services endpoint, or any customized domains pointing to this endpoint.
          - Any files stored in the Edge Services cache will be removed.
        
        <Message type="tip">
        Remember to:
            - Delete your CNAME record from your domain provider, unless your domain is managed with Scaleway Domains and DNS, in which case we take care of deletion for you.
            - Delete any SSL/TLS certificates you imported into Secret Manager (if no longer required elsewhere, so that you are no longer billed for it). If you generated a managed Let's Encrypt certificate however, Scaleway takes care of the deletion for you.
        </Message>

5. Click **Disable Edge Services**.

    Edge Services is disabled and the pipeline for this bucket is deleted. You can enable it again at any time to create a new pipeline, but you will need to reconfigure your custom domain, and the cache will initially be empty.
  </TabsTab>
  <TabsTab label="Load Balancer">
    1. Click **Load Balancers** in the **Network** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of your Load Balancers displays.

    2. Click the **Edge Services** tab. A list of your pipelines displays.

    3. Click the pipeline you want to delete. The Edge Services dashboard for that pipeline displays.

        <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-services-lb-dashboard.webp" alt="A screenshot of the Scaleway console, showing the Edge Services dashboard for a configured pipeline. Panels are visible for endpoint, cache and disable pipeline." />

    4. In the **Delete Edge Services pipeline** panel at the bottom of the screen, click **Delete Edge Services pipeline**.

            A pop-up displays, informing you that the pipeline will be deleted
            - The Load Balancer origin will no longer be accessible via its Edge Services endpoint, or any customized domains pointing to this endpoint.
            - Any files stored in the Edge Services cache for this pipeline will be removed.
        
            <Message type="tip">
            If you set up a customized domain for your Edge Services endpoint, remember to:
                - Delete your CNAME record from your domain provider, unless your domain is managed with Scaleway Domains and DNS, in which case we take care of deletion for you.
                - Delete any SSL/TLS certificates you imported into Secret Manager (if no longer required elsewhere, so that you are no longer billed for it). If you generated a managed Let's Encrypt certificate however, Scaleway takes care of the deletion for you.
            </Message>

    5. Click **Confirm*.

        The Edge Services pipeline for this Load Balancer origin is deleted. You create a new pipeline at any time, but you will need to reconfigure any custom domains, and the cache will initially be empty.
