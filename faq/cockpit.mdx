## What is Scaleway's Cockpit?

Scaleway's Cockpit is a monitoring and alerting solution designed for multi-source observability. Cockpit allows you to collect, store, and analyze metrics and logs from your infrastructure and applications, giving you insights into your system's performance and behavior.

## How does Cockpit integrate with other Scaleway products?

Cockpit integrates seamlessly with Scaleway’s ecosystem. It provides pre-built dashboards and alerts to monitor other Scaleway products' performance.

## How am I billed for using Cockpit with my Scaleway data?

Scaleway’s monitoring is included for free for a period of 30 days and 7 days for logs.
Extended storage is available for €29 per month and entails 12 months of storage for metrics and 1 month of storage for logs.

## How am I billed for using Cockpit with external data?

Cockpit’s pricing is based on two dimensions: the volume of external logs and metrics ingested and the duration of storage.
- Metrics are billed €0,15 per million of samples ingested.
- Logs are billed €0,35 per GB ingested.

You will not be charged for querying external data and the monitoring of your Scaleway resources is included for free for a period of 30 days.
