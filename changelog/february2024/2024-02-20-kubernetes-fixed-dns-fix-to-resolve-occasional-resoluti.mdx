The DNS resolution issue has been resolved. To implement the fix:

- Replace or reboot your nodes.
- Use a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for resolving addresses within the Private Network. For example, if you have a service named `foo` in the Private Network `mypn`, use `foo.mypn`.

<Message type="important">
  - Avoid using existing [top-level domains (TLDs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain) as Private Network names to prevent potential issues. For instance, naming your PN `fr` may cause problems resolving external addresses like `google.fr`.
  - Be aware that `prod` and `dev` are [valid TLDs](https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt).
