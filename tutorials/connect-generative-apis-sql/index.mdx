[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) is an open, standardized communication protocol that enables Large Language Models to interact with external tools and services through a defined interface. 

This tutorial demonstrates how to build a data analysis agent that connects Scaleway's Generative APIs with Serverless SQL using MCP. You'll learn how to create an AI agent that can:
- Understand your database schema automatically
- Convert natural language questions into SQL queries
- Execute queries and present results in human-friendly format

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing actions in the intended Organization
- Python 3.9 or higher
- An API key from Scaleway [Identity and Access Management](/iam/)
- Access to Scaleway [Generative APIs](/generative-apis/quickstart/) and [Serverless SQL](/serverless-sql/quickstart/)

## Introduction

The solution consists of three main components:

1. **Generative APIs**: Provides the AI model that processes natural language queries
2. **Serverless SQL**: Stores and manages the data
3. **Local AI agent**: Coordinates between the AI model and database

<Message type="note">
  The agent runs on a local machine in this tutorial but could also be embedded as a remote application.
</Message>

## Configuring Scaleway services

### Set up Generative APIs

1. Go to the Scaleway console and navigate to **Generative APIs**
2. Select a model (Mistral Small is used for this tutorial)
3. Click **View Code* and note down the *base URL* and *model name*

### Configure Serverless SQL

1. Go to **Databases** > **Serverless SQL**
2. [Create a new database](/serverless-sql-databases/how-to/create-a-database/) with default settings
3. Click **Connect application** > **Connect with an existing IAM Secret Key**
4. Switch to the **Connection string** tab and copy the connection string

### Seed the database

[Connect to your database](/serverless-sql-databases/how-to/connect-to-a-database/) and run the following SQL to create a test schema with some data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Sales (
    Product VARCHAR(50),
    Buyer VARCHAR(50),
    Timestamp TIMESTAMP
);

INSERT INTO Sales (Product, Buyer, Timestamp) VALUES
    ('Laptop', 'Alice', NOW() - INTERVAL '2 days'),
    ('Tablet', 'Bob', NOW() - INTERVAL '3 days'),
    ('Webcam', 'Ivan', NOW() - INTERVAL '30 minutes'),
    ('Printer', 'Judy', NOW() - INTERVAL '12 hours');
```

## Setting up the development environment

The AI Agent is built in Python using the [fast-agent](https://github.com/evalstate/fast-agent) open-source framework which has native support for the MCP protocol.

The [postgres-mcp](https://github.com/crystaldba/postgres-mcp) MCP server is used to communicate with Serverless SQL.

1. Install a package manager. `uv` is the recommended package manager by `fast-agent`:
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    uv venv
    ```

3. Install required libraries:
    ```bash
    uv pip install fast-agent-mcp postgres-mcp
    ```

These libraries work together to create a secure and efficient bridge between the AI model and your database.

## Creating the AI Agent

### Configure the agent

Create a file called `fastagent.config.yaml`:

```yaml
default_model: "generic.<Your model name>"

generic:
  api_key: "<Your Scaleway API Key>"
  base_url: "<Your Generative API Base URL>"

mcp:
  servers:
    database:
      command: "uv" 
      args: ["run", "postgres-mcp"]
      env:
        DATABASE_URI: "<Your Serverless SQL Connection String>"
```

### Create the agent script

Create a file called `agent.py` which will contain your agent logic.

1. Import the necessary modules and initialize the agent:
    ```python
    import asyncio
    from mcp_agent.core.fastagent import FastAgent

    fast = FastAgent("AI Agent")
    ```

2. Create agents with different responsibilities:
    ```python
    @fast.agent(
        "db_schema_reader",
        instruction="""Get the details of the 'sales' table in the 'public' schema of the database, which contains the sales data. Only return the column names and types.""",
        servers=["database"],
    )
    @fast.agent(
        "query_writer",
        instruction="""Write a SQL query to fetch the sales data from the database (sales table) given the input constraint. Only return the SQL query, no other text."""
    )
    @fast.agent(
        "query_executor",
        instruction="""Execute the following SQL statement on the database and write the results in JSON format""",
        servers=["database"],
    )
    ```

    <Message type="note">
    Each agent has a specific role. Some agents need direct database access through the MCP server (using the `servers=["database"]` parameter) while others don't
    </Message>

3. Create an orchestrator that coordinates the specialized agents:
    ```python
    @fast.orchestrator(
        name="sales_analyst",
        agents=["db_schema_reader","query_writer","query_executor"],
        plan_type="iterative",
        plan_iterations=4,
        instruction="You are a sales analyst given an input criteria. Describe the corresponding sales data from the database in one sentence."
    )
    ```
    The orchestrator:
    - Determines which agents to use and in what order
    - Sets an overall goal for the agent system
    - Uses an iterative planning approach to refine the results
    - Limits the number of iterations to prevent infinite loops

4. Create an entrypoint running the data analysis query **Get sales from last day**: 
    ```python
    async def main() -> None:
        async with fast.run() as agent:
            await agent.sales_analyst("Get sales from last day")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        asyncio.run(main())
    ```

5. Run the script with:
   ```bash
   python agent.py
   ```

The `fast-agent` framework provides details of all operations and outputs its data analysis:

    The sales data from the last day includes two transactions: a webcam purchased by Ivan at 14:52 and a printer purchased by Judy at 03:22. 


This tutorial demonstrated how to create an AI agent that can analyze your SQL database using natural language queries. By combining Scaleway **Generative APIs** with **Serverless SQL** through Model Context Protocol, you can create powerful tools that are accessible to non-technical users.
