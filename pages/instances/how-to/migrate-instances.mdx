The Scaleway console makes it very easy to migrate your data from one Instance to another or upgrade your Instance to a more powerful one if your requirements grow.

For more information about choosing the best Instance type to migrate to for your use case, see our [dedicated documentation](/instances/reference-content/choosing-instance-type/).

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An [Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) (We are using a DEV1-S Instance)

## How to back up the Instance

Follow the instructions to [create an image](/instances/how-to/create-a-backup/#how-to-create-an-image) of your Instance.

## How to create a new Instance from an image

1. Click **CPU & GPU Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The [Instances page](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elementsinstance/servers) displays.
2. Click the Instance you created an image of.
3. Click the **Images** tab.
4. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the Instance's image.
5. Select **Create Instance from image** on the drop-down list. You are redirected to the Instance creation wizard, where the image has been preselected for you at step 2.
6. Finish configuring the Instance according to your requirements:
    - You are free to choose your Instance type as long it uses the same CPU architecture (e.g. ARM to ARM or x86 to x86)
    - Click **Advanced options** and use the <Icon name="toggle" /> toggle to deselect **flexible IP**. This creates a the new Instance without a flexible IP, as we are going to attach the one from the existing Instance in the next step.
7. Click **Create Instance** to finish. The Instance is created and displays in your Instances list.

## How to move a flexible IP to a new Instance

Next, we will move the original DEV1-S Instance's [flexible IP address](/instances/concepts/#flexible-ip) to the new GP1-XS Instance.

1. Click **CPU & GPU Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The [Instances page](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elementsinstance/servers) displays.
2. Click the **Flexible IPs** tab.
3. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the Instance's flexible IP. In the pop-up menu that then displays, click **Switch Instance**.
4. Select the new Instance from the drop-down list, and click **Attach flexible IP to Instance**.

    The new Instance is now reachable via the old Instance's flexible IP.

## How to delete the old Instance

Presuming that you no longer need the original Instance, you can [delete it](/instances/how-to/delete-instance/).
