You can enable or disable your IoT Hub from the Scaleway console. This can be useful if you want to do maintenance actions on your hub, or if you want to change the [product plan](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/change-plan) of your hub.

1. Click **IoT Hub** in the **IoT Station** section of the side menu. The list of your IoT Hubs displays.

4. Confirm the status change by clicking **Diable Hub** or **Enable Hub** in the pop-up window.

  As long as a Hub is disabled it will not be billed, but its devices won't be able to connect.
