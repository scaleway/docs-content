This page shows you how to configure triggers for your Serverless Containers. A trigger is an event that invokes a container.

In a serverless architecture, a container is not running constantly, but is rather activated only when an event occurs. A trigger is a mechanism that connects the container to an event source and enables the container to run automatically in response to specific events.

A trigger can be an HTTP request, a message from a queue or stream, a CRON schedule etc. It is configured during the container deployment, and determines how and when the container will run.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Deployed a container from [Scaleway Container Registry](/serverless-containers/how-to/deploy-container/) or an [external registry](/serverless-containers/how-to/deploy-container/)
- [Created credentials](/queues/how-to/create-credentials/) for Scaleway Queues
- [Created a queue](/queues/how-to/create-manage-queues/)

<Message type="important">
You can create triggers on private containers, but to update the privacy of a container from **public** to **private**, you must recreate the existing **Scaleway Queues** and **Scaleway NATS** triggers after the privacy change. We are actively working to make this operation as seamless as possible.
</Message>

<Message type="note">
  Triggers send messages through a `POST` request with the message body in the request body.
</Message>

## Queue triggers

<Message type="note">
You must have at least the `MessagingAndQueuingReadOnly` permission in the Project containing the queue to add a queue trigger to Serverless Containers.

Refer to the [permissions sets documentation](/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/) for more information.
</Message>

[Queue triggers](/serverless-containers/concepts/#queue-trigger) allow you to automatically invoke a container using events stored in a [Scaleway queue](/queues/concepts/#scaleway-queues).

Only queues created with the Scaleway Queues product are compatible with Serverless Containers.

The configuration of the queue retention can affect the behavior of the trigger. Refer to the [Considerations to configure event retention for queue trigger inputs](/serverless-containers/reference-content/configure-trigger-inputs/) page for more information.

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The containers page displays.
2. Click the relevant containers namespace.
3. Click the name of the container you want to manage. The container overview displays.
4. Click the **Triggers** tab. The trigger configuration displays.
5. Click **Create trigger**. The trigger creation form displays in a pop-up.
6. Enter a **name** for your trigger and select the **Queues (Scaleway)** type, then select your queue name.
7. Click **Create trigger** to launch the trigger creation.

When a message is pushed to the selected queues, the container will be triggered with the message content passed in the event object's body.

<Message type="note">
  **Retry Policy:** If the Container returns a status code superior or equal to 300, sending the message will be retried up to three times.
</Message>

## NATS triggers

<Message type="note">
You must have at least the `MessagingAndQueuingReadOnly` permission in the Project containing the NATS account to add to a Serverless Container.

Refer to the [permissions sets documentation](/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/) for more information.
</Message>

[NATS triggers](/serverless-containers/concepts/#nats-trigger) allow you to automatically invoke a container using messages sent in a [NATS](/nats/concepts/#nats) subject.

[Scaleway NATS subjects](/nats/quickstart/) are compatible with Serverless Containers.

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The containers page displays.
2. Click the relevant containers namespace.
3. Click the name of the container you want to manage. The container overview displays.
4. Click the **Triggers** tab. The trigger configuration displays.
5. Click **Create trigger**. The trigger creation form displays in a pop-up.
6. Enter a **name** for your trigger and select the **NATS (Scaleway)** type, then select your NATS account and subject name.
7. Click **Create trigger** to launch the trigger creation.

<Message type="note">
  **Retry Policy:** If the Container returns a status code superior or equal to 300, sending the message will be retried up to three times.
</Message>

## CRON triggers

[CRON triggers](/serverless-containers/concepts/#cron-trigger) allow you to invoke your containers based on a recurring schedule. The CRON triggers for Serverless Containers use the **UTC** time zone.

<Message type="note">
The arguments of a CRON trigger are injected in the body of the `POST` HTTP request, and sent to the `/` endpoint.
</Message>

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The containers page displays.
2. Click the relevant containers namespace.
3. Click the name of the container you want to manage. The container overview displays.
4. Click the **Triggers** tab. The trigger configuration displays.
5. Click **Create trigger**. The trigger creation form displays in a pop-up.
6. Enter a **name** for your trigger and select the **CRON** type. Enter the cron schedule in UNIX format and paste your JSON arguments in the form.
7. Click **Create trigger** to launch the trigger creation.

The container will be invoked at the indicated time.

<Message type="note">
    Refer to the [cron schedules reference](/serverless-containers/reference-content/cron-schedules/) for more information.
