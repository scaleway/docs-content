Tart is a virtualization toolset developed for building, running, and managing macOS and Linux virtual machines (VMs) on Apple silicon. Engineered by CI experts to meet automation needs, Tart provides several noteworthy features.

Utilizing Apple's Virtualization framework, Tart ensures near-native performance, providing a smooth virtualization experience.
Virtual machines can be effortlessly pushed and pulled from any OCI-compatible container registry, enhancing flexibility and compatibility.

The inclusion of the Tart Packer Plugin streamlines the process of VM creation, allowing for automated and efficient virtual machine setup.
Furthermore, Tart seamlessly integrates with any Continuous Integration (CI) systems, allowing you to configure workflows for automated tasks and processes.

One notable application of Tart is its role as the driving force behind the Cirrus Runners service, positioned as a superior alternative to standard GitHub-hosted runners.
This service not only offers 2-3 times better performance but also does so at a fraction of the cost, highlighting Tart's ability to optimize virtualization for enhanced efficiency.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).
  - You have [created a Mac mini](/bare-metal/apple-silicon/how-to/create-mac-mini/) running macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or later.
  - You have installed a package manager. For the sake of this tutorial, we will use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/index) which is a popular package manager for macOS.

## Installing Tart and a first VM on macOS

1. Install Tart using Homebrew. Open your terminal and run the following command to install Tart on your Mac mini using Homebrew.
    ```sh
    brew install cirruslabs/cli/tart
    ```

2. Clone the desired VM image from the available MacOS images on Tart's GitHub repository. For example, to run the MacOS Sonomoa image, use the following commands:
    ```sh
    tart clone ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-sonoma-base:latest sonoma-base
    tart run sonoma-base
    ```
    <Message type="tip">
        Explore the full list of [available MacOS images](https://github.com/orgs/cirruslabs/packages?tab=packages&q=macos-) on Tart's official GitHub repository.
    </Message>

3. The virtual machine displays. Log into the virtual machine with the provided credentials.
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin`

   The MacOS desktop displays:

## Running Linux images with Tart

Currently, Tart supports the following Linux images:

* Ubuntu: `ghcr.io/cirruslabs/ubuntu:latest`
* Debian: `ghcr.io/cirruslabs/debian:latest`
* Fedora: `ghcr.io/cirruslabs/fedora:latest`

1. Clone the Ubuntu image and resize its disk size to 50GB using the following commands:
    ```sh
    tart clone ghcr.io/cirruslabs/ubuntu:latest ubuntu
    tart set ubuntu --disk-size 50
    ```
    <Message type="tip">
        Resizing is optional but useful to adapt the disk size according to your requirements. The default disk size for Linux images is 20GB.
    </Message>

2. Run the resized Ubuntu image and log in with the provided credentials.
    ```sh
    tart run ubuntu
    ```

        Explore the full list of [available Linux images](https://github.com/orgs/cirruslabs/packages?repo_name=linux-image-templates) on Tart's official GitHub repository.
    </Message>

3. After running the Ubuntu image, log into the virtual machine with the provided credentials.
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin`

  <Message type="tip">
    On images with SSH enabled, you can login either from the terminal or by using the SSH server, listening on the private IP address of the VM.

## Mounting directories

### Mounting a directory
  To mount a directory, initiate the VM with the `--dir` argument.
    ```bash
    tart run --dir=my-project:~/src/my-project vm
    ```
    <Message type="tip">
        For read-only mode, include a third parameter, `:ro`.
        ```bash
        tart run --dir=my-project:~/src/my-project:ro vm
        ```
    </Message>

### Mounting multiple directories
  Repeat the `--dir` argument for each directory if you want to mount several.
    ```bash
    tart run --dir=www1:~/my-project1/www --dir=www2:~/my-project2/www
    ```
    <Message type="tip">
        Ensure that the first parameter in each `--dir` argument is unique. Otherwise, only the last `--dir` argument using that name will be applied.
    </Message>

## Accessing mounted directories

### macOS guests
All shared directories automatically mount to the `/Volumes/My Shared Files` directory within the guest VM.

### Linux guests
To access shared directories from the Linux guest, manually mount the virtual filesystem:
```bash
mount -t virtiofs com.apple.virtio-fs.automount /mnt/shared
```
The directory mounted using this command will be accessible from `/mnt/shared/my-project` within the guest VM.
