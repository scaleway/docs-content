## Differences between Functions, Containers, and Jobs

### Considerations

* **Serverless Containers** offers more flexibility by allowing you to deploy any containerized application. It is suitable for stateless services and can handle more complex applications with configurable concurrency and no maximum execution time.
* **Serverless Functions** is ideal for lightweight, event-driven code where you do not manage the underlying infrastructure. It is limited to specific languages and not suitable for long-running processes.
* **Serverless Jobs** is designed for executing batch jobs or tasks that need to run to completion. It is ideal for data processing tasks, migrations, or any workload that does not fit the request-response model.

## Details

### Serverless Jobs

Serverless Jobs are designed for batch computing workloads, particularly large-scale and asynchronous tasks, like data processing, image rendering, or complex computations.

Choose Scaleway [Serverless Jobs](/serverless-jobs/quickstart/):

- For long-running tasks and resource-intensive applications.
- To handle numerous jobs concurrently.
- If you do not need to expose your service on a port.
- For asynchronous processing.

<Message type="note">
  To run as a Serverless Job, your applications must be containerized, which offers you a lot of choice when configuring your runtime environments.
</Message>

### Serverless Functions

Choose Scaleway [Serverless Functions](/serverless-functions/quickstart/):

- For HTTP and event-driven tasks.
- For optimum performance in lightweight scenarios.
- For autoscaling applications.
- For web-facing applications and web servers.
- For stateless workloads.

<Message type="note">
  Serverless Functions can only be written in languages [available as runtimes](/serverless-functions/reference-content/functions-runtimes/#available-runtimes).
</Message>

### Serverless Containers

Choose Scaleway [Serverless Containers](/serverless-containers/quickstart/):

- For HTTP and event-driven tasks.
- If your programming language is not supported as a Serverless Function runtime.
- For autoscaling workloads.
- For stateless workloads.
