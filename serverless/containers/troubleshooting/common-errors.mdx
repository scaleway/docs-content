## Unable to deploy the image

    Does the container listen on 0.0.0.0 on port “$PORT” or 8080
    KSVC is in RevisionMissing and pods in CrashLoopBackOff

Inspect the image used by the customer and check the Architecture:
docker inspect rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/scrapfast/node-web-app-test@sha256:4a389d6866ea6e35b226a69bfe55f754b0678f3da3b99fd6eab62a00b64094d0 | grep Arch
        "Architecture": "arm64",

If it is arm64 , it can't work with knative, the customer must have built it on ARM machine (Apple M1 for exemple). Tell him to build it for amd64 architecture.


## Unable to build

Is the namespace registry still available ?
Image is deployed but 

    Can’t access to specific folder or files


## Unable to create a namespace

This can happened for the following reasons : 

    User created to much namespaces and hit the max quotas (see limits page)
    User created to much Registry namespace and the system can't create more


Try to change KSVC port

Edit the KSVC to change current listening port to see if it starts, do not forget tu delete generated revisions


### Check image size

skopeo inspect --raw docker://registry.docker.com/library/alpine@sha256:e7d88de73db3d3fd9b2d63aa7f447a10fd0220b7cbf39803c803f2af9ba256b3 \
  | jq -r '[ .layers[].size ] | add'
