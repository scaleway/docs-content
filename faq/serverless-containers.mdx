## Are applications deployed on Serverless Containers stateless?

Yes, all applications deployed on Serverless Containers are stateless. This means the server does not store any state about the client session. Instead, the session data is stored on the client and passed to the server as needed.

## How am I billed for Serverless Containers?

### Principles

Serverless Containers are billed on a pay-as-you-go basis, strictly on resource consumption (Memory and CPU).

* **Memory consumption:** The memory consumption is obtained by multiplying the memory tier chosen by the container run duration.
* **vCPU consumption:** The vCPU consumption is obtained by multiplying the vCPU tier chosen by the container run duration.

### Prices

* **Memory consumption:** €0.10 per 100 000 GB-s, and we provide a **400 000 GB-s free tier** per account and per month.

    | Memory   | Price per second  |
    |--------- |------------------ |
    | 128 MB   | €0.000000125 	   |
    | 256 MB   | €0.00000025  	   |
    | 512 MB   | €0.0000005   	   |
    | 1024 MB  | €0.000001 	       |
    | 2048 MB  | €0.000002    	   |
    | 3072 MB  | €0.000003    	   |
    | 4096 MB  | €0.000004    	   |

* **vCPU consumption:** €1.00 per 100 000 vCPU-s, and we provide a **200 000 vCPU-s free tier** per account per month.

    | CPU       	| Price per second  |
    |------------ |------------------ |
    | 0.07 vCPU 	| €0.0000007 	      |
    | 0.14 vCPU 	| €0.0000014	      |
    | 0.28 vCPU 	| €0.0000028        |
    | 0.56 vCPU 	| €0.0000056	      |
    | 1.12 vCPU 	| €0.0000112        |

### Example

| Criteria                   | Value        	|
|--------------------------- |--------------	|
| Monthly duration           | 30 000 000 s 	|
| Amount of memory allocated | 128 MB       	|
| Amount of vCPU allocated   | 70 mVCPU     	|
| Free tier                  | Yes          	|

#### Price calculation

* **Memory consumption**
    * *Allocated Memory conversion:* 128 MB = 0.125 GB
    * *Resource consumption:* 30 000 000 s * 0.125 GB = 3 750 000 GB-s
    * *Free tier:* 400 000 GB-s
    * *Billed resources:* 3 750 000 - 400 000 = 3 350 000 GB-s
    * *Cost:* 3 350 000 * €0.0000010 = **€3.35**
* **vCPU consumption**
    * *Allocated vCPU conversion:* 70mVCPU = 0.070 vCPU
    * *Resource consumption:* 30 000 000 s * 0.070 vCPU = 2 100 000 vCPU-s
    * *Free tier:* 200 000 vCPU-s
    * *Billed resources:* 2 100 000 - 200 000 = 1 900 000 vCPU-s
    * *Cost:* 1 900 000 * €0.0000100 = **€19.00**

**Monthly Cost: €22.35**

## How to select the right resources (vCPU/RAM) for Serverless Containers ?

Insufficient vCPU and RAM resources can lead to containers going to error status. Make sure to provision enough resources for your container.

We recommend you set high values, [use metrics to monitor](/serverless/containers/how-to/monitor-containers/) the resource usage of your container, then adjust the value accordingly.

## How to reduce cold-start of Serverless Containers ?

* **Optimize the startup**: Cold-start can be affected by a loading a large number of dependencies and opening lot of resources at startup.
Ensure that your code avoids heavy computations or long-running initialization at startup and optimize the number of loaded libraries.

* **Keep your container warm**: You can use CRON triggers at certain intervals to keep your container warm or set the min-scale parameter to one when required.

* **Increase resources**: Adding more vCPU and RAM can help to significantly reduce the cold-starts of your container.

* **Use sandbox v2**: We recommend you use sandbox v2 (advanced settings) to reduce cold starts.

## What are the limitations of Serverless Containers?

Refer to our dedicated page about [Serverless Containers limitations and configuration restrictions](/serverless/containers/reference-content/containers-limitations/) for more information.

## Can I whitelist the IPs of my containers?

Serverless Containers does not yet support Private Networks. However, you can use the Scaleway IP ranges defined  at [https://www.scaleway.com/en/peering/](https://www.scaleway.com/en/peering/) on Managed Databases and other products that allow IP filtering.

## How can I deploy my Containers?

There are several ways to deploy containers, [this page](/serverless/containers/reference-content/deploy-container/) should help you decide which method is right for you.

## Which protocols are supported by Serverless Containers?

Serverless Containers use the **http1** protocol by default, but some services (e.g., gRPC) only support http2.

Protocol switching is currently not available in the console but can be changed by using:

* [CLI (doc)](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/blob/master/docs/commands/container.md#update-an-existing-container)
* [API (doc)](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-containers/)

## Why does my gRPC container not respond?

Containers use http1 by default, yet the gRPC protocol requires http2. You can upgrade the protocol to http2 (`h2c`).

## How does Serverless Container healthcheck work ?

A Serverless Container is set to `ready` once the specified port is correctly bound to the container, and will start receiving traffic. If your application needs to perform some tasks before receiving traffic (e.g. connect to a database), it's important to run them before binding to the port (starting the webserver).
For now, the `HEALTHCHECK` Docker directive has no impact on container readiness. In the future, the healthcheck will be customizable for your applications.
