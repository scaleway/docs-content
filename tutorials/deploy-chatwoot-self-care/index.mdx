<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your SSH key](/console/project/how-to/create-ssh-key)
  - You have [created a Production-Optimized Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) with at least 8 GB RAM and 25 GB Block Storage, running on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
  - You have [installed Ruby 3.2.2](/tutorials/ruby-on-rails/) on the Instance
  - You have a (sub-)domain pointed to the Instance's IP address
</Message>

1. [Log into your Instance using SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).
2. Update the `apt` package cache and upgrade the software already installed on the Instance to the latest version available in the distribution repositories.
    ```
    apt update && apy upgrade -y
    ```
3. Download the Chatwoot installation script and make it executable:
    ```bsh
    wget https://get.chatwoot.app/linux/install.sh
    chmod +x install.sh
    ```
4. Check the version of Ruby installed on your Instance. Chatwoot requires Ruby 3.2.2.
    ```bsh
    ruby -v
    ruby 3.2.2 (2023-03-30 revision e51014f9c0) [x86_64-linux]
    ```
    <Message type="tip">
      If you are not using Ruby 3.2.2, you have to install it to avoid the installation failing. You can install it, using `rbenv`:
      ```
      rbenv install 3.2.2 #Installs Ruby 3.2.2
      rbenv global 3.2.2 #Configures Ruby 3.2.2 to be used system-wide
      ```
    </Message>
5. Run the Chatwoot installation script:
    ```bsh
    ./install.sh --install
    ````
    * The script asks you if you want to configure Chatwoot with a domain and SSL. Type `yes` and press enter.
    * Type the domain name for Chatwoot (e.g. `chatwoot.domain.com`) and press enter.
    * Type an email address for LetsEncrypt to send reminders when your SSL certificate is up for renewal and press enter.
    * Confirm your choices by typing `yes` and press enter. 
    * Type `yes` to install Postgres and Redis as database engines used by Chatwoot and press enter.
    * The installation script will install the required dependencies, databases and Chatwoot.
    * Once the installation has completed, the following message displays:
        ```
        ***************************************************************************
        Woot! Woot!! Chatwoot server installation is complete.

## Upgrading Chatwoot to a newer version

Whenever a newer version of Chatwoot is released, you can upgrade your installation to stay up-to-date with the latest development and features added.

1. [Log into your Instance as root using SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).

2. From the root login, change into Chatwoot user account to perform the upgrade.
    ```bsh
    sudo -i -u chatwoot
    ```

3. Navigate to the Chatwoot application directory.
    ```bsh
    cd /home/chatwoot/chatwoot
    ```

4. Use Git to pull the latest version of Chatwoot's master branch.
    ```bsh
    git checkout master && git pull
    ```

5. Update the required dependencies.
    ```bsh
    bundle
    yarn
    ```

6. Use `rake` to recompile the assets.
    ```bsh
    rake assets:precompile RAILS_ENV=production
    ```

7. Migrate the database schema.
    ```bsh
    RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:migrate
    ```
8. Switch back to the `root` user account
    ```bsh
    exit
    ```
9. Copy the updated targets.
    ```bsh
    cp /home/chatwoot/chatwoot/deployment/chatwoot-web.1.service /etc/systemd/system/chatwoot-web.1.service
    cp /home/chatwoot/chatwoot/deployment/chatwoot-worker.1.service /etc/systemd/system/chatwoot-worker.1.service
    cp /home/chatwoot/chatwoot/deployment/chatwoot.target /etc/systemd/system/chatwoot.target
    ```

10. Reload the `systemd` files.
    ```bsh
    systemctl daemon-reload
    ```
11. Restart the Chatwoot server to run the upgraded version.
    ```bsh
    systemctl restart chatwoot.target
    ```

You have now successfully installed Chatwoot on your Instance and have learned how to upgrade it to the latest version once there is a new release of the application. For more information about Chatwoot, refer to the official [Chatwoot User Guide](https://www.chatwoot.com/docs/product).
