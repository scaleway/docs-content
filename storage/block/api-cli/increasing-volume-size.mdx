<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have a [Scaleway account](/console/my-account/how-to/create-an-account/)
  - You have [configured your API keys](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
  - You have a [Block Storage volume](/storage/block/api-cli/creating-a-volume)
</Message>

1. Inspect the volume and verify its name, size and if the type is `b_ssd` by running the following request.
    ```
    curl -q -H "X-Auth-Token: $SECRET_KEY" -X GET https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/<REGION>/volumes/<VOLUME_ID>
    ```

  <Message type="note">
    Replace `<REGION>` with the geographical region of the Instance. This value can either be `fr-par-1`, `fr-par-2` or  `fr-par-3` for Instances located in Paris, `nl-ams-1` or `nl-ams-2` for Instances located in Amsterdam, or `pl-waw-1` or `pl-waw-2` for Instances located in Warsaw. Replace `<VOLUME_ID>` with the unique identifier of the volume, which can be found on the Scaleway console under **Instances > Volumes > More Info (for the selected volume)**.
  </Message>

  The following response should appear as an output:

  ```
  {"volume": {"creation_date": "2020-06-02T08:04:50.094118+00:00", "server": null, "id": "VOLUME_ID", "size": 25000000000, "name": "myAwesomeVolume", "zone": "<REGION>", "export_uri": null, "volume_type": "b_ssd", "modification_date": "2020-06-02T08:04:50.094118+00:00", "state": "available", "organization": "<ORGANIZATION_ID>"}}
  ```
2. To modify the volume size, run the request below:
    ```
    curl https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/<REGION>/volumes/<VOLUME_ID> -H "X-Auth-Token: $SECRET_KEY" -X PATCH -H 'Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8' --data '{ "name":"new_name", "size":26000000000 }'
    ```
  Replace `<REGION>`and `<VOLUME_ID>` following the guidelines mentioned previously and replace the existing size value with the new one.

  <Message type="note">
    You can use the same request to change the name of you volume by replacing `new_name` by another of your choice. If you do not wish to change the volume name, erase `"name":"new_name",`from the request before running it.
  </Message>

  A response appears confirming the changes:
  ```
  {"volume": {"creation_date": "2020-06-02T08:04:50.094118+00:00", "server": null, "id": "<VOLUME_ID>", "size": 26000000000, "name": "new_name", "zone": "<REGION>", "export_uri": null, "volume_type": "b_ssd", "modification_date": "2020-06-02T08:08:27.385208+00:00", "state": "resizing", "organization": "<ORGANIZATION_ID"}}
  ```
