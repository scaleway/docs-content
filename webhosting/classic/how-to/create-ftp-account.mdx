3. Fill in the form to create your FTP account, entering the following values: 

    * a **username** (eg `webmaster`)
    * a **password** of your choice

  When you [connect to your FTP account](/webhosting/classic/how-to/connect-via-ftp/), the following folders display:   

  * `awffull` (contains your old access statistics, if they were activated)
  * `www` (should contain your website)
  * `logs` (contains your old access statistics, if they were activated)
  * `UPLOADER_VOTRE_SITE_DANS_LE_REPERTOIRE_WWW` (this directory serves simply as a reminder as to where to upload your website files)

<Message type="important">

  - Keep in mind that your website is located in the folder `/www` on the FTP server. 
  - Upload all your website's content into this folder.

## How to limit the access to an FTP account 

To limit access to an FTP account, create the folder you want to access (example: `client`) in the folder `www` (the one containing your website). Then follow these steps:

1. Log into the [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net)

2. Click **Hosting**, then click **Manage**.

3. Click the **FTP accounts** tab.

4. Enter **/www/client/** in the **Directory** field of your new account.

<Message type="important">

Ensure that you follow the syntax `/www/directory/` in order for your account to work.
