## Introduction

Once you know how to create variables in Python, like `my_variable = 3`, it is really useful to be able to **store multiple items in a single variable**. This is where lists and dictionaries come in. Lists and dictionaries are both **data types** in Python for storing **collections** of data. 

**Lists** are defined with square brackets, and can hold multiple different elements which can either be the same type (e.g. all strings) or different types (e.g. a mix of strings, integers, booleans etc.). A basic list creation statement is `class_marks = [99, 68, 72, 50, 72]`. 

    Creating lists lets you carry out mathematical operations on the collection of data (like finding the average mark), iterate over the data to perform actions on each item (like add 5 to each mark), sort the data (e.g. from lowest mark to highest mark) and much more!

**Dictionaries** are defined with curly brackets, and hold **key/value pairs**. A basic dictionary creation statement is `student_marks = {"Sara": 99, "Aneesa": 68, "Emmanuel": 72, "Tom": 50, "Candice": 72}`. 

    Just like with lists, you can carry out mathematical operations on the data, iterate over it to perform actions and sort the data. But with dictionaries, you can also associate specific values with specific keys, so in this case you could retrieve the mark of a particular student by using the key of their name.

The examples in this tutorial use short, manually-created lists and dictionaries, without huge amounts of data in them. But, bear in mind that:
- **Lists and dictionaries can handle big amounts of data**: A large part of why lists and dictionaries are so useful is that they can handle huge amounts of data, and provide efficient ways to manage and manipulate it. It is possible to import data from other sources (spreadsheets, text files, websites, etc.) directly into Python to feed your lists and dictionaries. 
- **Lists and dictionaries are made for loops!** Another reason that lists and dictionaries are such an important thing to learn in Python, is that they go hand-in-hand with loops. Loops are a coding fundamental, and something we will focus on in the next tutorial in this series. Among many other things, loops let you **iterate** over the data in your lists and dictionaries and carry out complex operations on it. But before we can start on loops, we need to understand lists and dictionaries.
 
Read on to find out more about lists and dictionaries, and learn how to create and manipulate them in Python, with lots of examples provided.

## Lists

### Creating and displaying lists

For the purposes of this tutorial, we'll imagine that we have a class of 5 students who have taken a test, and we want to use a list to hold the test results. Remember, Python knows to create a variable of list type when you use square brackets. 

1. Use the following code to create an empty list. You can use either the Python Interactive Shell, or save the code in a file using a text editor then execute it in the terminal as described in the [previous tutorial](/tutorials/get-started-python/#6:-from-the-shell-to-a-script):

    ```python
    class_marks = []
    ```

    This creates an empty list to hold the class marks. Or, you could just skip straight to the next step and create the list with all its values in it.

2. Use the following code to create a list of class marks:

    ```python
    class_marks = [99, 68, 72, 50, 72]
    ``` 

3. Ask Python to display the list of marks with the following code:

    ```python
    class_marks
    ``` 
    
<Message type="tip">
  In this example we've created a list of [integers](/tutorials/get-started-python/#4:-variables-and-assignment) (whole numbers), but you can store any type of variables in a list. Look at the following examples:
    - `student_names = ["Sara", "Aneesa", "Emmanuel", "Tom", "Candice"]` creates a list of strings
    - `random_list = [54.5, "hello", 64, True, 1, "NO"]` creates a list with a mixture of variable types
    - `list_of_lists = [[62, 92, 54.5], ["Jones", "Smith", "Ali"], [True, 1, "maybe"]]` creates a list of lists!
</Message>

### Accessing specific items in a list

Python lets us access specific items in a list by referring to their **index position** within the list.

The first item in a list is always at index position **O**. The second item is at index position **1**, the third at position **3** and so on.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-python-list.webp" alt="a 2 by 5 table shows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 across the top row and 99, 68, 72, 50, 72 across the bottom row" />

To access an item in a list, use the name of the list variable, followed by the index number of the item in square brackets.

1. Access the second item in the list of class marks with the following code:

    ```python
    class_marks[1]
    ```

    Output:

    ```python
    68
    ```

    Once you know how to access a list item, you can change its value! Let's imagine we realized we made a mistake, and the second class mark was actually 67, not 68. 
    
2. Use the following code to change the second mark in the list:

    ```python
    class_marks[1] = 67
    ```

3. Display the list of class_marks, and see the following output:

    ```
    [99, 67, 72, 50, 72]
    ```

    There is another index that you can use to access items in a list, and this one works from right to left! The right-most item in a list has the index **-1**, then moving one to the left you have **-2** and so on:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-python-list-reverse-index.webp" alt="a 2 by 5 table shows -5, -4, -3, -2, -1 across the top row and 99, 67, 72, 50, 72 across the bottom row" />

4. Access the last item in the list with the following code:

    ```python
    class_marks[-1]
    ```

    Output:

    ```python
    72
    ```

### Accessing a slice of the list

You can access a subsection of a list, or a **slice** of the list, by using square brackets with a colon. Before the colon, put the index position of the first item to return, and after the colon put the index position of the last item to return.

1. Use the following code to access the second, third and fourth items in the list:

    ```python
    class_marks[1:4]
    ```

    Output:

    ```python
    [68, 72, 50]
    ```
  
    If you don't put a number after the colon, Python returns a slice of the list starting from the first index position you specify, including all the rest of the list to the end.

2. Use the following code to access a subsection of the list starting from the third item and going through to the end:

    ```python
    class_marks[2:]
    ```

    Output:

    ```python
    [72, 50, 72]
    ``` 

    If you do not put a number **before** the colon, Python returns a slice of the list starting from the beginning, and up to but not including the item at the index position after the colon.
  
3. Use the following code to access the subsection of the list starting from the beginning, up to but not including the item at index position 3:

    ```python
    class_marks[:3]
    ```

    Output

    ```python
    [99, 68, 72]
    ```

<Message type="tip">

  What happens if you use slicing with the reverse index (the minus number index positions)? Try it out and see.

### Adding items to a list: append, extend and insert

There are a number of different ways to add items to a list in Python, and we go over a few of them in this section.

The first, and most common, is the `append()` method, which allows us to add an item to the end of the list.

1. Use the `append()` method to add a new mark of `83` to the end of the list of marks, and ask Python to display the list of marks afterwards:

    ```python
    class_marks.append(83)
    class_marks
    ```

    Output:

    ```python
    [99, 68, 72, 50, 72, 83]
    ```

    Next, we have the `extend()` method, which allows us to add a new list of items to the end of the list.

2. Use the `extend()` method to add two new marks of `49` and `55` to the end of the list of marks, and ask Python to display the list of marks afterwards:

    ```python
    class_marks.extend([49, 55])
    class_marks
    ```

    Output:

    ```python
    [99, 68, 72, 50, 72, 83, 49, 55]
    ```

    <Message type = "tip">
      Try out the following to see how to use `extend()` with an existing list:

      ```python
      group1_marks = [62, 51]
      group2_marks = [48, 80]
      group1_marks.extend(group2_marks)
      ```
    </Message>

    Finally, the `insert()` method lets us insert a new item to a list in a specific index point.

3. Use the `insert()` method to add a mark of `30` at index position 1 (i.e. in second position in the list):

    ```python
    class_marks.insert(1, 30)
    class_marks
    ```

    Output:

    ```python
    [99, 30, 68, 72, 50, 72, 83, 49, 55]
    ```

### Removing items from a list: remove, pop and delete

Just as with adding items, there are multiple ways to remove items from lists too.

To remove a specific item from the list, we have the `remove()` method.

Remember that our list of marks currently looks like the following: `[99, 30, 68, 72, 50, 72, 83, 49, 55]`

1. Use the `remove()` method to remove the mark of 68 from the list:

    ```python
    class_marks.remove(68)
    class_marks
    ```

    Output:

    ```python
    [99, 30, 72, 50, 72, 83, 49, 55]
    ```

    <Message type="tip">

      If you use the `remove()` method with an item that has more than one occurrence in the list (e.g. for the mark 72 in our case) it will remove the first occurrence of the item only.
    
    </Message>

    Next we have the `pop()` method, which removes the item at the specified index position:

2. Use the `pop()` method to remove the first mark (99, at index position 0) from the list:

    ```python
    class_marks.pop(0)
    class_marks
    ```

    Output:

    ```python
    [30, 72, 50, 72, 83, 49, 55]
    ```

    If we want to create a new variable with the "popped" item, we can do that too:

3. Use the `pop()` method to remove the third mark (50, at index position 2) and put it in a new variable:

    ```python
    single_mark = class_marks.pop(2)
    ```

4. Use the following code to check the current values of `class_marks` and `single_mark`

    ```python
    print(single_mark)
    print(class_marks)
    ```

    Output:

    ```python
    50
    [30, 72, 72, 83, 49, 55]
    ```

    Finally, you can use the `del` keyword to delete an item at a specified index point, or a slice of the list, or the complete list.

5. Use the `del` keyword to delete the mark of 72 at index position 1:

    ```python
    del class_marks[1]
    class_marks
    ```

    Output

    ```python
    [30, 72, 83, 49, 55]
    ```

6. Use the `del` keyword to delete the slice of the list from index positions 0 (first item) up to but not including index position 2 (third item):

    ```python
    del class_marks[0:2]
    class_marks
    ```

    Output

    ```python
    [83, 49, 55]
    ```

    Finally, we can use the `del` keyword to delete the whole list! Indeed, we can use it to delete any type of variable we want, so that Python forgets the variable completely.

7. Use the `del` keyword to delete the list:

    ```python
    del class_marks
    class_marks
    ```

    Output:

    ```python
    NameError: name 'class_marks' is not defined
    ```

    Python no longer remembers the variable, so our request to display it after deleting it returns an error.
    
<Message type="tip">

  Note that the syntax for appending, removing, extending etc. is `list_name.method_name()`, whereas the syntax for deleting is `del list_name`. This is because append, remove, extend etc. are all **methods**, whereas del is a **keyword**. Methods and keywords have different syntax, even if they both carry out operations on a given variable or item!

### Useful list operations

For the last section of our list tutorial, let's look at some useful operations that you might want to carry out on a list of data.

1. Recreate the `class_marks` variable as it originally was, to give us a base for the rest of this section: 

    ```python
    class_marks = [99, 68, 72, 50, 72]
    ```

2. Use the `sort()` method to sort the marks in the list into ascending order, then display the result:

    ```python
    class_marks.sort()
    class_marks
    ```

    Output:

    ```python
    [50, 68, 72, 72, 99]
    ```

    <Message type="note">

    By default, `sort()` sorts the list in ascending order. Use `class.marks.sort(reverse=True)` to sort into descending order.

    </Message>

3. Use the `sum()` method to get the sum of all marks in the list:

    ```python
    sum(class_marks)
    ```

    Output:

    ```python
    361
    ```

4. Use the `len()` method to get the length of the list, i.e. the total number of items in it:

    ```python
    len(class_marks)
    ```

    Output:

    ```python
    5
    ```

5. Use the `sum()` and `len()` methods together to calculate the average mark, and then display it:

    ```python
    average_mark = sum(class_marks) / len(class_marks)
    average_mark
    ```

    Output:

    ```
    72.2
    ```

<Message type="tip">

  Try using the methods `min()`, `max()` and `set()` on the `class_marks` list, to get the lowest mark, highest mark, and list of unique marks with any duplicates eliminated.

## Dictionaries

While a simple list may be sufficient for storing values and carrying out operations like finding the average, what if we wanted to have a record not just of the class marks, but of which students got which marks? That's where dictionaries come in. Dictionaries are identified with curly brackets as opposed to square brackets, and contain a series of key/value pairs.

Note that the methods we used on our lists - indexing to retrieve values, `insert()`, `extend()`, `append()` etc. - don't work on dictionaries. We need to learn a new set of methods, shown below.

### Creating and displaying dictionaries

1. Use the following code to create an empty dictionary:

    ```python
    student_marks = {}
    ```

    Alternatively, skip straight to the next step and create the dictionary with its key/value pairs already defined.

2. Use the following code to create a dictionary of student marks. Note that for each item in the list, the key (in our case, the student name) comes first. Since names are strings, we put them in quotation marks. After the key comes a colon, followed by the value (in our case, a mark which is an integer). Each key/value pair is separated by a comma:

    ```python
    student_marks = {"Sara": 99, "Aneesa": 68, "Emmanuel": 72, "Tom": 50, "Candice": 72}
    ```

3. Ask Python to display the dictionary with the following code:

    ```python
    student_marks
    ```

    Output:

    ```python
    {"Sara": 99, "Aneesa": 68, "Emmanuel": 72, "Tom": 50, "Candice": 72}
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
    In this example we've created a dictionary where the keys are strings and the values are integers. Values can be any variable type you want, and keys can be any immutable variable type. This means you can use integers, floats, strings and booleans as keys, but you cannot use lists or dictionaries as keys.

    All of the following are valid dictionary creation statements. The last one is a dictionary of dictionaries.
    - `random_dictionary = {9: "hello", "seven": true, 10.5: ["one", 19, false]}`
    - `sara_stats = {"Name": "Sara", "Family name": "Snook", "Age": 35, "Alive": True}`
    - `my_pets = {"Toby": {"Animal: "Dog", Breed": "Labrador", "Age": 2}, "Goldie": {"Animal: "Fish, "Breed": "Goldfish", "Age:": 1}}`

    Every key in a dictionary **must** be unique. It cannot be repeated. However, values do not have to be unique within the dictionary.
    </Message>

### Accessing keys and values within the dictionary

There are a number of different ways to access the keys and values within the dictionary.

1. Use the following code to find the value associated with a given key. In this case, we want to know Sara's mark:

    ```python
    student_marks.get("Sara")
    ```

    Output:

    ```python
    99
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
    It is also possible to use the syntax `student_marks["Sara"]` for the same purpose, but this usage is not considered optimal by Python. This is because if you look up a key that doesn't exist in the dictionary, e.g. `student_marks["Greg"]`, Python returns an error. When using the `get()` syntax to look up a key that doesn't exist in the dictionary, Python simply returns a `None` response. <br />
    <br />
    You can add an extra argument to the `get()` method, to tell Python what to return if the key doesn't exist. For example `student_marks["Greg", "Not in dictionary"]` returns `"Not in dictionary"`/
    </Message>


2. Use the following code to get a view object showing a list of all the keys in the dictionary, in our case the list of student names: 

    ```python
    student_marks.keys()
    ```

    Output:

    ```python
    dict_keys(['Sara', 'Aneesa', 'Emmanuel', 'Tom', 'Candice'])
    ```

3. Use the following code to get a view object showing a list of all the values in the dictionary, in our case the list of student marks: 

    ```python
    student_marks.values()
    ```

    Output:

    ```python
    dict_values([99, 68, 72, 50, 72])
    ```

### Adding items to a dictionary

1. Use the following code to add a new item to the dictionary, then display the dictionary. In our case we imagine we have a new student called Paxton:

    ```python
    student_marks["Paxton"] = 76
    student_marks
    ```

    Output:

    ```python
    {'Sara': 99, 'Aneesa': 68, 'Emmanuel': 72, 'Tom': 50, 'Candice': 72, 'Paxton': 76}
    ```

    The `update()` method lets us add one or many key/value pairs to the dictionary:

2. Use `update()` to add two new students and their marks to the dictionary, then display the dictionary:

    ```python
    student_marks.update({"Devi": 80, "Fabiola": 55})
    student_marks
    ```

    Output:

    ```python
    {'Sara': 99, 'Aneesa': 68, 'Emmanuel': 72, 'Tom': 50, 'Candice': 72, 'Paxton': 76, 'Devi': 80, 'Fabiola': 55}
    ```

### Removing items from a dictionary

Some of these methods and keywords will be familiar from the list section of the tutorial.

1. Use the `pop()` method to remove a key/value pair from the dictionary, specified by the key. Then display the dictionary again to check it has gone:

    ```python
    student_marks.pop("Emmanuel")
    student_marks
    ```

    Output:

    ```python
    {'Sara': 99, 'Aneesa': 68, 'Tom': 50, 'Candice': 72, 'Paxton': 76, 'Devi': 80, 'Fabiola': 55}
    ```

    As with lists, we can use `pop()` to create a new variable.

2. Use the `pop()` method to remove Aneesa's mark and put it in a new variable:

    ```python
    aneesa_mark = student_marks.pop("Aneesa")
    aneesa_mark
    ```

    Output:

    ```python
    68
    ```

    Also similar to lists, we can use the `del` keyword to delete an item, specified by its key:

3. Use the `del` keyword to delete Sara's mark and then display the dictionary:

    ```python
    del student_marks["Sara"]
    student_marks
    ```

    Output:

    ```python
    {'Tom': 50, 'Candice': 72, 'Paxton': 76, 'Devi': 80, 'Fabiola': 55}
    ```

    Finally, we can use the `clear()` method to wipe everything from the dictionary.

4. Use `clear()` to clear the dictionary of all its key/value pairs, then display the dictionary:

    ```python
    student_marks.clear()
    student_marks
    ```

    Output:

    ```python
    {}
    ```

### Useful dictionary operations

It's generally not as simple to carry out operations on dictionaries as on lists:

- Dictionaries do not, by definition, have any inherent order, so the `sort()` method does not work on them.
- You cannot use `max()`, `min()`, `sum()` etc. to quickly see the maximum, minimum and sum of values in a dictionary.

A lot of the cool stuff you can do with dictionaries involves using **loops**, which will be the subject of our next tutorial. But in the interim, here are some things you **can** do with dictionaries, without using loops:

1. Recreate the `student_marks` variable as it originally was, to give us a base for the rest of this section:

    ```python
    student_marks = {"Sara": 99, "Aneesa": 68, "Emmanuel": 72, "Tom": 50, "Candice": 72}
    ```

2. Use `len()` to find out the length of the dictionary (how many key/value pairs it has):

    ```python
    len(student_marks)
    ```

    Output:

    ```python
    5
    ```

    We saw previously that we can use `values()` to get a view object showing a list of all the values in the dictionary. However, this doesn't give us an actual list variable, but just a view, so we can't carry out list operations on it. There's a way to get around this though! We can use the `list()` function, which creates a list object:

3. Create a new variable, using `list()` and give it `student_marks.values()` as an argument. Then display the new variable:

    ```python
    marks_only = list(student_marks.values())
    marks_only
    ```

    ```python
    [99, 68, 72, 50, 72]
    ```

    Now you have the list of marks, you can use all the [list operations](#useful-list-operations) we previously saw on it!

|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Create a dictionary                       | `student_marks = {"Sara": 99, "Aneesa": 68, "Emmanuel": 72, "Tom": 50, "Candice": 72}`    |
| Get a value from its key                  | `student_marks.get("Aneesa")` Output: `68`                    |
| View all keys in the dictionary           | `student_marks.keys()` Output `dict_keys(['Sara', 'Aneesa', 'Emmanuel', 'Tom', 'Candice'])`|
| Get a list of all values in the dictionary | `list(student_marks.values())`                              |
| View all values in the dictionary         | `student_marks.values()` Output: `dict_values([99, 68, 72, 50, 72]`)  |
| Add a single key/value pair to the dictionary | `student_marks["Paxton"] = 76`                             |
| Add multiple key/value pairs to the dictionary | `student_marks.update({"Devi": 80, "Fabiola": 55})`       |
| Remove a key/value pair from the dictionary and return (pop) its value | `student_marks.pop("Sara")`       |
| Delete a key/value pair from the dictionary | `del student_marks['Aneesa']`                                |
| Clear the whole dictionary (delete all key/value pairs) | `student_marks.clear()`                          |
| Get the length of the dictionary  | `len(student_marks)`                                                   |
