If your database engine is outdated, you can upgrade the version to the latest one anytime via the Scaleway console.

<Message type="note">
You must upgrade your engine version if your Database Instance uses an End of Life engine version that is no longer maintained.
</Message>

<Message type="important">
The version upgrade is only available for:
  - Database Instances using engine versions preceding the most recent version available.
  - Database Instances using Block volumes. If your Database Instance uses a local volume, you must first [change the volume type](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/change-volume-type) to a Block volume and try again.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have a [PostgreSQL Database Instance](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/create-a-database) running on an outdated engine version
</Message>

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the name of the database whose engine you want to upgrade. The Database Instance information page appears.
3. Click **Upgrade** under **Database engine**. A pop-up appears.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-engine-version-upgrade-pop-up.webp" alt="The pop-up says - This will upgrade your Database Instance rdb-peaceful-dijkstra. The upgrade will create a clone of your current Database Instance with an up-to-date engine version. Both the original and the new Database Instances will be billed. There is a drop-down to select a new engine version and they type of upgrade - 'Upgrade Only' or 'Upgrade and switch incoming traffic'. In the image 'Upgrade only is selected', and an information box says: 'No impact to your original Database Instance. Your Database Instance will remain available with its original endpoints. If you update your endpoints manually, you can revert to the old ones anytime." />
3. Select the upgrade method. Two methods are available:
    - **Upgrade only**: This method has no impact on your original Database Instance. Your Database Instance will remain available with its original endpoint and will continue to be billed.
    - **Upgrade and switch incoming traffic**: With this method your endpoint is migrated to the new Database Instance automatically. This option will create a clone of your Database Instance, and will automatically migrate the endpoint to the new Instance. The original Database Instance remains available, and will continue to be billed. The endpoint will be deleted from the original Database Instance.


    <Message type="important">
      When you upgrade to a new version, there is no synchronisation between the source and target Database Instances. To avoid data loss, we recommend you stop any write operations running on your applications during the upgrade. If you let them run during the process, the data will be stored only in the source Database Instance.
    </Message>

    <Message type="tip">
      Follow the [migrating endpoints via the CLI](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/api-cli/migrating-endpoints) procedure to quickly migrate your endpoints. You can use this procedure to revert the migration anytime.
    </Message>
4. Click **Upgrade version**. A new Database Instance is created.

    <Message type="important">
      On PostgreSQL, engine extensions are handled and upgraded automatically during the upgrade process.
