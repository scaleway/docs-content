This page provides information about how you will be billed for using Cockpit and its features with custom and Scaleway data.


## Billing information for using Cockpit with Scaleway data

Scaleway data is collected and available in Cockpit for free.

Retention is also free as long as it stays within the default period: 31 days for metrics and 7 days for logs. Data stored beyond the default period will incur charges based on daily storage volume.
You can [adjust the retention period](/cockpit/how-to/change-data-retention) from 1 day (for logs) or 31 days (for metrics) to 5 years. Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/cockpit/concepts/#retention) for more information on available retention periods.

## Billing information for using Cockpit with custom data

Sending custom data to Cockpit incurs ingestion costs.

Retention of custom data is free within the default period: 31 days for custom metrics and 7 days for custom logs and traces. Data stored beyond the default period will incur charges based on daily storage volume. You can [adjust the retention period](/cockpit/how-to/change-data-retention) from 1 day to 5 years.

Ingestion of custom data is billed as follows:

- Custom metrics are billed €0.15 per million samples of metrics ingested
- Custom logs are billed €0.35 per GB ingested
- Custom traces are billed €0.35 per GB ingested

Scaleway applies volume discounts to bill custom metrics. This means that the monthly pricing for custom metrics will be calculated in levels. **Scaleway applies six levels of volume discounts.**

| Levels       | Range                                        | Monthly pricing with volume discounts    |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Level one    | From 0 to 10 billion custom metrics          | €0.15 per million samples                |
| Level two    | From 10 to 25 billion custom metrics         | €0.13 per million samples                |
| Level three  | From 25 to 50 billion custom metrics         | €0.12 per million samples                |
| Level four   | From 50 to 100 billion custom metrics        | €0.11 per million samples                |
| Level five   | From 100 to 200 billion custom metrics       | €0.10 per million samples                |
| Level six    | From 200 billion custom metrics and beyond   | €0.08 per million samples                |


Here is an example of how you would be billed for **sending 52 billion custom metrics samples per month**:

- 10 billion samples at €0.15 per million samples: €1.500
- 15 billion samples at €0.13 per million samples: €1.950
- 25 billion samples at €0.12 per million samples: €3.000
- 2 billion samples at €0.11 per million samples: €220

**Total:** €6.670 per month with volume discounts instead of €7.800 without volume discounts.

Refer to our [documentation on understanding and managing Cockpit ingestion to reduce costs](/cockpit/reference-content/understanding-cockpit-usage/) for more information on how to reduce extra costs when ingesting custom data.

## Billing information for increasing data retention period

All ingested data, whether from Scaleway or custom sources, is retained for free within the default periods:
- Metrics: 31 days
- Logs and traces: 7 days

**Data stored beyond the default period will incur charges based on daily storage volume**:

- Metrics: €0.0002 per 10 million samples/day
- Logs and traces: €0.002 per GB/day

If you delete your data source or reduce its retention period below the default value, data will be deleted and you will no longer be charged for extended retention.

| Say you ingest an average of **2 GB of logs daily** and increase retention to **10 days**. <br /> <br />                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Retention is free for the first **7 days**, so you are only charged for the extra **3 days**. <br /> <br />  **Monthly estimated cost:** <br /> <br />      `retention_cost` = 2 GB x (10 - 7) x 0.002€ x 30 days = 0.36€/month | If you extend retention to **90 days**, you are charged for the extra **83 days** beyond the free period. <br /> <br />  **Monthly estimated cost:** <br /> <br />     `retention_cost` = 2 GB x (90 - 7) x 0.002€ x 30 days = 9.96€/month |

## Billing information for Cockpit data exports

Data exports are free of charge during the beta period. After that, you will be billed based on the volume of data exported.

You are responsible for how your exported data is used and for any changes in resource volume. Adding resources naturally increases the number of generated metrics and logs, and exported volume may fluctuate even without manual action (for example, autoscaling creates additional resources, and therefore, more data to export).
