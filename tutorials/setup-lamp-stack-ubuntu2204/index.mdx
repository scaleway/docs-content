## LAMP stack overview

The LAMP stack references a group of software that can be used to serve dynamic web applications and websites. LAMP is an acronym and stands for **L**inux, **A**pache, **M**ySQL, and **P**HP). 
The concept describes a server environment that consists of a Linux operating system (Ubuntu Jammy Jellyfish 22.04 LTS), an Apache web server, a MySQL (or MariaDB) database server, and the PHP programming language.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your SSH key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
  - You have a [Scaleway Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) running on Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish)
  - You have a FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) pointing to your Instance's IP address
  - You have sudo privileges or access to the root user
</Message>

## Installing the LAMP stack on an Ubuntu 22.04 Instance

1. [Connect to your Instance via SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).
2. Use the `apt` package manager of Ubuntu to install the required packages. Make sure that the system is up-to-date and has the latest bug-fixes and updates installed by running the following command:
    ```bash
    apt update && apt -y upgrade
    ```
3. Install the software stack:
    ```bash
    apt install -y ufw apache2 mariadb-server php-fpm php-mysql
    ```

## Securing the database engine

1. Launch the configuration wizard to configure the database server:
    ```bash
    mysql_secure_installation
    ```
2. Press **Enter** when prompted for the current root password for the MariaDB server, as the password is not yet set.
3. Press `Y` to switch to `unix_socket` authentication:  
    ```
    Switch to unix_socket authentication [Y/n]
    ```
4. Press `N` to keep your current root password, press `Y` to change the root password:
    ```bash
    You already have your root account protected, so you can safely answer 'n'.

    Change the root password? [Y/n]
    ```
5. Enter the new password if you decided to change the root password, press `Enter`, then repeat this step.
6. Keep the settings proposed by default when prompted by further questions, by pressing `Enter` each time.

## Configuring an Apache virtual host

Apache stores the configuration of virtual hosts configuration files. All available configuration files are located in the `/etc/apache2/sites-available/` directory.

1. Navigate to the relevant directory:
    ```
    cd /etc/apache2/sites-available/
    ```
2. Create a new virtual hosts configuration file and name it after the domain name that points to your Instance. Here we call it `example.com.conf` and put the following content into the file:
    ```
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName example.com
        ServerAlias www.example.com
        DocumentRoot "/var/www/html/example.com"
        <Directory "/var/www/html/example.com">
            Options FollowSymLinks
            AllowOverride all
            Require all granted
        </Directory>

        <FilesMatch \.php$>
        SetHandler "proxy:unix:/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock|fcgi://localhost"
        </FilesMatch>

        ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error.example.com.log
        CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access.example.com.log combined
    </VirtualHost>
    ```

    Remember to replace `example.com` and any other information as necessary as per the overview below:

    Overview:
      - `*:80` — Defines the port Apache listens on. Here, it listens on port 80, the default port for HTTP.
      - `ServerName` — The domain name relating to this Apache virtual host.
      - `ServerAlias` - An alias name under which the Apache virtual host is reachable.
      - `DocumentRoot` — Specifies the document root where all files of the website are stored.
      - `Directory` — Gives directives for a specific directory.
      - `ServerName` — The domain name relating to this Apache virtual host.
      - `ErrorLog` — Refers to the error log file of this Apache virtual host.
      - `CustomLog` — Specifies the access log file of this Apache virtual host. 
3. Save and exit the file.
4. Activate the new virtual host in Apache:
    ```bash
    a2ensite example.com
    ```
5. Enable the `proxy_fcgi` module:
    ```
    a2enmod proxy_fcgi
    ```
6. Reload the Apache configuration to make the site available. 
    ```bash
    systemctl reload apache2.service
    ```

## Securing your Instance with a firewall

1. Enable HTTP, HTTPS and SSH connections in the [firewall](/tutorials/installation-uncomplicated-firewall/) configuration of the Instance by running the following command:
    ```bash
    ufw allow 'Apache Full'
    ufw allow 'OpenSSH'
    ```
2. Enable ufw:
    ```bash
    ufw enable
    ```

    Confirm the activation of the firewall by typing `y`:

    ```bash
    Command may disrupt existing ssh connections. Proceed with operation (y|n)? y
    Firewall is active and enabled on system startup
    ```
3. Check the status of ufw:
    ```bash
    ufw status
    ```
  
    It will return a list of the allowed services:

    ```bash
    Status: active

    To                         Action      From
    --                         ------      ----
    Apache Full                ALLOW       Anywhere
    OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
    Apache Full (v6)           ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
    OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
  ```


## Testing PHP

1. Create a test PHP file to test if your LAMP stack is working.
    ```bash
    nano /var/www/html/example.com/phpinfo.php
    ```
2. Put the following content in it:
    ```php
    <?php
    phpinfo();
    ?>
    ```
3. Save the file and point your web browser to `http://example.com/phpinfo.php` (replacing `example.com` with your domain name). When you see an output like the following, it means PHP is set up correctly:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-lamp-php81.webp" alt="" />

## Securing your site with Let's Encrypt

By default, the connection between your computer and the Instance is not encrypted, and it is possible to read the communication. To secure the connection you can generate an SSL certificate for free, issued by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org).

Let's Encrypt provides a [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) to configure the Apache web server automatically with Let's Encrypt.
2. Install certbot.
    ```bash
    apt install python3-certbot-apache
    ```
3. Run certbot.
    ```bash
    certbot --apache
    ```
4. Answer the prompts.
