Starting this deprecation cycle, existing Kubernetes Kapsule or Kosmos worker nodes can be moved from NAT IPs to Routed IPs. 

With Routed IPs, your worker nodes will receive a flexible IP address, maintaining IP consistency even if the Instance is restarted or the hypervisor is changed.

NAT IPs will reach end of life on October 1st, 2024. 

- All information on the migration methods are provided in our [documentation about moving Kubernetes nodes to routed IPs](/containers/kubernetes/reference-content/move-kubernetes-nodes-routed-ip/).
