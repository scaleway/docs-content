You can view the permission sets granted to API keys (via policies) through the Scaleway console, [the API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/iam/#path-permission-sets-list-permission-sets), and the Scaleway CLI.

    <Requirements />
    - A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
    - [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

    1. Click **IAM & API keys** on the top-right drop-down menu of the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) displays.

    2. Click the name of the user whose permissions you want to view. The user information page displays.
        <Message type="tip">
        To view your own permissions as a Member, you can follow the same process and click your name. If you cannot see your own permissions, contact an admin of the Organization, as you may not have the necessary permissions.
        </Message>
    3. Scroll to the **Permission sets** section.

    A list of your permission sets for the selected Organization displays. You can see the scope of the permissions, in which [IAM policy](/iam/concepts/#policy) they were defined, and to which [principal](/iam/concepts/#principal) they are attached to.

  <TabsTab label="Via the SCW CLI">
    <Requirements />
      - A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
      - An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
      - [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
      - An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
      - A valid [API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
      - Installed and configured the [Scaleway CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli) on your local machine

      Run the following command in a terminal. Make sure you replace `<access_key>` with the access key of the API key for which you wish to know the permission sets.

      ```
      scw iam api-key get <access_key>
      ```

      You should get an output like the following:
      ```
      User Type:
      member

      Api Key:
      AccessKey         SCW13J04TP146R5FRANZ
