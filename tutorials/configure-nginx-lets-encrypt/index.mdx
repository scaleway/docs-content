## Let's Encrypt - Overview

Let's Encrypt is a Certificate Authority (CA) that provides free TLS/SSL certificates to enable [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) on web servers. They provide a software client called Certbot to automatize most of the steps required to obtain a certificate and to configure it within the Nginx web server.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An [Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance) running Ubuntu Focal Fossa (20.04) or later
- A registered domain name pointed to your web server

### Installing the NGINX web server

1. Connect to your server as `root` via [SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).
2. Update the APT package cache and the software already installed on the Instance:
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
3. Install the [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) web server via APT:
    ```
    apt install nginx -y
    ```

### Configuring a NGINX server block

The default installation of Nginx on Ubuntu Focal Fossa (20.04 LTS) comes with one pre-defined server block that listens on port 80. While it is possible to host a single site by putting the content into the directory **/var/www/html**, it would not be possible to host multiple sites on the same Instance. To avoid this problem, server blocks can be configured. These specify a directory for the content that will be served when requesting a specific site. The content of **/var/www/html** will be served as the default directory if a request does not match any other site configured.

<Message type="important">
  In this tutorial the domain name **example.com** will be used. You should replace it with your own domain name while setting up your Instance.
</Message>

1. Create the directory for your domain name. Using the `-p` flag will create any required parent directory in case they do not exist:
    ```
    mkdir -p /var/www/example.com/html
    ```
2. Create a place holder page that will be displayed when accessing your domain:
    ```
    nano /var/www/example.com/html/index.html
    ```
3. Put some content like the following into the file which will be displayed to a user when requesting your site. Save and quit nano once you have edited the file:
    ```
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Welcome to example.com</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Hello World!</h1>
            <p>You have accessed the example.com website.</p>
        </body>
    </html>
    ```
4. To serve the site, a server block is required. Create the block in the directory **/etc/nginx/sites-available/**:
    ```
    nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com
    ```

    And put the following content into it:

    ```
    server {
            listen 80;
            listen [::]:80;

            root /var/www/example.com/html;
            index index.html index.htm;

            server_name example.com www.example.com;

            location / {
                    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
            }
    }
    ```

    <Message type = "important">
      Edit the lines `root` and `server_name` according to your domain name.
    </Message>
5. Enable the file by linking it to the **sites-enabled** directory, to enable the server block during Nginx startup:
    ```
    ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
    ```
6. Verify if there are no errors in the configuration file before restarting Nginx:
    ```
    nginx -t
    ```
7. Restart the Nginx web server:
    ```
    systemctl restart nginx.service
    ```
8. When typing *http://example.com* in your browser, you should see your newly created place holder page:

### Installing Certbot and obtaining a certificate

1. Install Certbot for Nginx:
    ```
    apt install python3-certbot-nginx -y
    ```
2. Launch the certificate generation:
    ```
    certbot --nginx -d example.com -d www.example.com
    ```

    <Message type = "important">
      The parameter `-d` specifies the domains for which you want to request a certificate. Make sure to replace it with your own domain name. Also keep in mind that if you want to have a certificate for _example.com_ and for *www.example.com* you have to specify both.
    </Message>

    When running Certbot for the first time, you will be asked to enter your email address. Confirm it by pressing **Enter** on your keyboard.
3. Once confirmed Certbot will run a challenge and request the certificate. When asked to redirect all traffic to HTTPS, press **2**, then **Enter** on your keyboard:
    ```
      Please choose whether or not to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS, removing HTTP access.
      - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
      1: No redirect - Make no further changes to the webserver configuration.
      2: Redirect - Make all requests redirect to secure HTTPS access. Choose this for
      new sites, or if you're confident your site works on HTTPS. You can undo this
      change by editing your web server's configuration.
      - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
      Select the appropriate number [1-2] then [enter] (press 'c' to cancel):
    ```

    Certbot will now reconfigure Nginx and once you see the following message your certificate is successfully installed:

    ```
    IMPORTANT NOTES:
      - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
        /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem
        Your key file has been saved at:
        /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem
        Your cert will expire on 2019-04-15. To obtain a new or tweaked
        version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot again
        with the "certonly" option. To non-interactively renew *all* of
        your certificates, run "certbot renew"
      - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
        configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
        secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
        also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
        making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
      - If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:
