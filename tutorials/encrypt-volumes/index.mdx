To protect sensitive commercial or client data stored on your Instances, encryption is paramount.
The repercussions of such data falling into unauthorized hands can be detrimental to your business.
Encrypting the entire volume is the optimal strategy, alleviating concerns about individual folders.
By using this method, all sensitive information can reside on an encrypted volume, fortified by an extra layer of security.
This tutorial will walk you through the process of encrypting an additional volume using [Cryptsetup](https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/) with [LUKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup), a universally recognized on-disk format employed in various encryption tools.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An [Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance)
- A [Block Storage volume connected to the Instance](/storage/block/how-to/attach-a-volume/)
- `sudo` privileges or access to the root user

## Installing Cryptsetup

1. [Connect to your Instance via SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/)
2. Update the apt sources and the software already installed on the Instance:
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
3. Install Cryptsetup on the Instance:
    ```
    apt install cryptsetup-bin
    ```
4. Enter the command `lsblk`. This lists your volumes to help you to determine which is the additional volume to encrypt:
    ```
    root@encrypted-disk:~# lsblk
    NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    vda     252:0    0 46.6G  0 disk
    |-vda1  252:1    0 46.5G  0 part /
    `-vda15 252:15   0  100M  0 part /boot/efi
    vdb     252:16   0 46.6G  0 disk
    ```

In this example the space of `vdb` is not mounted and represents the additional volume of the Instance.

<Message type="note">
  The name of your additional volume may be different, eg `sda` or other, depending on the Instance type and OS. Replace with the name corresponding to your volume where necessary.
</Message>

## Encrypting the volume

1. Encrypt the volume vdb with Cryptsetup:
    ```
    cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/vdb
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      On low memory Instances your may run into `out of memory` (OOM) errors when running `cryptsetup luks{Format,Open}` commands on large volumes. To avoid them, add `--pbkdf pbkdf2` to your command:
      ```
      cryptsetup luksFormat --pbkdf pbkdf2 /dev/vdb
      ```
    </Message>

    A warning appears, reminding you that all data on the volume will be lost.

    ```
    WARNING!
    ========
    This will overwrite data on /dev/vdb irrevocably.

    Are you sure? (Type uppercase yes):
    ```
2. Type `YES` and press the Enter key, to confirm you want to overwrite the data.
    <Message type="important">
      Make sure you have a backup of your data on this volume before you launch Cryptsetup. Your data will be irrevocably overwritten and lost.
    </Message>

    A message appears, asking you to configure a passphrase. A passphrase is the key to decrypt the data on the volume.
3. Type your passphrase and press Enter. For increased security, your passphrase should be a secure and random phrase. If required, you may use a [Passphrase generator](https://www.useapassphrase.com/).

    A message appears, asking you to verify your passphrase.
4. Type your passphrase again to confirm it, then press Enter on your keyboard to encrypt the disk.
    <Message type="important">
      If you forget your passphrase, you will not be able to recover your data. Make sure that you store your password securely.
    </Message>

Your volume is now encrypted.

## Mapping the encrypted volume

1. Type the following command to create a mapping (`crypthome`) of the volume:
    ```
    cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/vdb crypthome
    ```
2. Enter your passphrase when requested, and press the Enter key on your keyboard:
    ```
    Enter passphrase for /dev/vdb:
    ```
3. Run the following command to verify the status of the encrypted volume:
    ```
    cryptsetup -v status crypthome
    ```

    An output similar to the following appears:

    ```
    /dev/mapper/crypthome is active.
      type:    LUKS1
      cipher:  aes-xts-plain64
      keysize: 256 bits
      key location: dm-crypt
      device:  /dev/vdb
      sector size:  512
      offset:  4096 sectors
      size:    97652154 sectors
      mode:    read/write
    Command successful.
    ```

## Formatting the encrypted volume

Start by writing zeros to the encrypted volume. This allocates zeros to block data, to ensure that it appears as random data. This provides protection against disclosure of usage patterns:

1. Install `pv` (if not already installed) by running the following command:
    ```
    apt install pv
    ```
2. Launch the following command to run `dd`:
    ```
    pv -tpreb /dev/zero | dd of=/dev/mapper/crypthome bs=128M
    ```

    <Message type="important">
      Depending on the size of your volume this may take some hours to finish.
    </Message>

    Once finished, a message similar to the following displays:

    ```
    dd: error writing '/dev/mapper/crypthome': No space left on device                        <=>                                                 ]
    46.6GiB 0:05:29 [ 144MiB/s] [                                                               <=>                                               ]

    49997902848 bytes (50 GB, 47 GiB) copied, 331.56 s, 151 MB/s
    ```
3. Create a filesystem on the encrypted volume by running the following command:
    ```
    mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/crypthome
    ```

    An output similar to the following displays once the filesystem is created:

    ```
    mke2fs 1.44.1 (24-Mar-2018)
    Creating filesystem with 12206519 4k blocks and 3055616 inodes

    Writing inode tables: done
    Creating journal (65536 blocks): done
    Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done
    ```

## Mounting the encrypted volume

1. Create a folder to mount the volume:
    ```
    mkdir /mnt/crypthome
    ```
2. Mount the encrypted volume with the following command:
    ```
    mount /dev/mapper/crypthome /mnt/crypthome/
    ```
3. Verify with `lsblk` that the volume is mounted:
    ```
    NAME        MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE  MOUNTPOINT
    vda         252:0    0 46.6G  0 disk
    |-vda1      252:1    0 46.5G  0 part  /
    `-vda15     252:15   0  100M  0 part  /boot/efi
    vdb         252:16   0 46.6G  0 disk
    `-crypthome 253:0    0 46.6G  0 crypt /mnt/crypthome
    ```

    The encrypted volume is now mounted at `/mnt/crypthome` and you can transfer your sensitive data to the volume.

## Unmounting the encrypted volume

1. Unmount the volume from your Instance:
    ```
    umount /mnt/crypthome
    ```
2. Close the LUKS session with Cryptsetup:
    ```
    cryptsetup luksClose crypthome
    ```
3. Verify that the volume has been unmounted with `lsblk`:
    ```
    NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    vda     252:0    0 46.6G  0 disk
    |-vda1  252:1    0 46.5G  0 part /
    `-vda15 252:15   0  100M  0 part /boot/efi
    vdb     252:16   0 46.6G  0 disk
    ```

    As you can see, the following lines have disappeared:

    ```
    vdb         252:16   0 46.6G  0 disk
    `-crypthome 253:0    0 46.6G  0 crypt /mnt/crypthome
    ```

## Remounting the encrypted volume

1. Use Cryptsetup to open the LUKS session and enter the passphrase when prompted:
    ```
    cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/vdb crypthome
    ```
2. Mount the volume in the Instance:
    ```
    mount /dev/mapper/crypthome /mnt/crypthome
    ```
3. Verify that the volume appears with `lsblk` :
    ```
    NAME        MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE  MOUNTPOINT
    vda         252:0    0 46.6G  0 disk
    |-vda1      252:1    0 46.5G  0 part  /
    `-vda15     252:15   0  100M  0 part  /boot/efi
    vdb         252:16   0 46.6G  0 disk
    `-crypthome 253:0    0 46.6G  0 crypt /mnt/crypthome
    ```

    As you can see, the following lines have reappeared. This means your encrypted volume is mounted again and you can use it to store or access your sensitive data:

    ```
    vdb         252:16   0 46.6G  0 disk
    `-crypthome 253:0    0 46.6G  0 crypt /mnt/crypthome
    ```

## Changing the LUKS passphrase

LUKS supports up to 8 passphrases for each encrypted volume. You may wish to change the passphrase of your encrypted volume, which you can do as follows:

1. Check if there is still space available by retrieving the LUKS headers:
    ```
    cryptsetup luksDump /dev/vdb
    ```

    The list of available key slots displays:

    ```
    Key Slot 1: DISABLED
    Key Slot 2: DISABLED
    Key Slot 3: DISABLED
    Key Slot 4: DISABLED
    Key Slot 5: DISABLED
    Key Slot 6: DISABLED
    Key Slot 7: DISABLED
    ```

    As you can see 7 slots are available for the volume.
2. Type the following command and enter any current passphrase:
    ```
    cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/vdb
    ```

    When prompted, enter the new passphrase and its confirmation:

    ```
    Enter new passphrase for key slot:
    Verify passphrase:
    ```
3. Verify that the new passphrase has been taken into account by retrieving the LUKS headers:
    ```
    cryptsetup luksDump /dev/vdb
    ```

    Scroll down to the list of available keys, the output should be similar to the following:

    ```
    Key Slot 2: DISABLED
    Key Slot 3: DISABLED
    Key Slot 4: DISABLED
    Key Slot 5: DISABLED
    Key Slot 6: DISABLED
    Key Slot 7: DISABLED
    ```

    As you can see only 6 slots are available now, meaning that the new key has been configured.
4. Remove the old passphrase with the following command:
    ```
    cryptsetup luksRemoveKey /dev/vdb
    ```

    Enter the passphrase to delete and confirm by pressing Enter.
5. Verify that the key has been removed by retrieving the LUKS headers:
    ```
    cryptsetup luksDump /dev/vdb
    ```

    In the list of available key slots, 7 slots are available again.
