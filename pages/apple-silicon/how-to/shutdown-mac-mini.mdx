Due to operational constraints, a Scaleway Mac mini should not be fully shut down using conventional methods. Below are guidelines for managing your Mac mini's usage and shutdown procedures.

<Message type="important">
    If you force the shutdown of your Mac mini using the command line or any other method, it will not be possible to manually turn it back on via SSH or the Scaleway Console. To ensure service continuity, we have implemented safeguards that will automatically restart the Mac mini within 24 hours.
