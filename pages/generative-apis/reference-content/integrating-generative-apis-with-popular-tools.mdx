## OpenAI-compatible libraries

Scaleway Generative APIs follow OpenAI's API structure, making integration straightforward. To get started, you'll need to install the OpenAI library and set up your API key.

### Configuration

To use the OpenAI library with Scaleway's Generative APIs, you'll need to set the API key and base URL in your OpenAI-compatible client:
```python
import openai
openai.api_key = "<API secret key>"
openai.api_base = "https://api.scaleway.ai/v1"
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke about AI"}]
)
print(response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```
<Message type="tip">
  Make sure to replace `<API secret key>` with your actual API key.
</Message>

### Using OpenAI for text generation

To use OpenAI for text generation, you can create a `ChatCompletion` object and call the `create` method:
```python
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke about AI"}]
)
print(response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```

## LangChain (RAG & LLM applications)

LangChain is a popular library for building AI applications. Scaleway's Generative APIs support LangChain for both inference and embeddings.

### Configuration

To use LangChain with Scaleway's Generative APIs, you'll need to install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install langchain langchain_openai langchain_postgres psycopg2
```
Next, set up the API connection:
```python
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings, ChatOpenAI
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<API secret key>"
os.environ["OPENAI_API_BASE"] = "https://api.scaleway.ai/v1"
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="llama-3.1-8b-instruct")
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="bge-multilingual-gemma2")
```
<Message type="tip">
  Make sure to replace `<API secret key>` with your actual API key.
</Message>

### Using LangChain for inference

To use LangChain for inference, you can create a `ChatOpenAI` object and call the `ask` method:
```python
response = llm.ask("What is the capital of France?")
print(response)
```
### Using LangChain for embeddings

To use LangChain for embeddings, you can create an `OpenAIEmbeddings` object and call the `compute_embeddings` method:
```python
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="bge-multilingual-gemma2")
text = "This is an example sentence."
embedding = embeddings.compute_embeddings(text)
print(embedding)
```
## LlamaIndex (document indexing & retrieval)

LlamaIndex is a library for indexing and retrieving documents using AI models. Scaleway's Generative APIs support LlamaIndex for document indexing and retrieval.

### Configuration

To use LlamaIndex with Scaleway's Generative APIs, you'll need to install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install llama-index
```
Next, set up the embedding model:
```python
from llama_index.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbedding
embed_model = OpenAIEmbedding(
    api_key="<API secret key>",
    api_base="https://api.scaleway.ai/v1",
    model="bge-multilingual-gemma2"
)
```
<Message type="tip">
  Make sure to replace `<API secret key>` with your actual API key.

### Indexing documents

To index documents using LlamaIndex, you'll need to create a `VectorStoreIndex` object and call the `add_documents` method:
```python
from llama_index import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader
documents = SimpleDirectoryReader("data").load_data()
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents, embed_model=embed_model)
```
### Retrieving documents

To retrieve documents using LlamaIndex, you can call the `query` method on the `VectorStoreIndex` object:
```python
query_engine = index.as_query_engine()
response = query_engine.query("Summarize this document")
print(response)
```

## Continue Dev (AI coding assistance)
