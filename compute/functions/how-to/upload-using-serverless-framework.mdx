This plugin allows [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/) users to deploy their functions and containers to Scaleway Functions with a simple serverless deploy.
Serverless Framework will handle everything from the namespace creation to the function/code deployment by calling APIs endpoint under the hood.

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)  
  - You have [configured your API keys](/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key/) for your **Project**
  - You know your **Project ID**
  - You have installed **node.js**
  - You have installed **Serverless CLI** on your computer (`npm install serverless -g`)

</Message>

## Create a project folder
Serverless Framework enables you to create a project using a specific template.

1. Start by creating and changing into `~/my-srvless-projects`:

```bash
# mkdir ~/my-srvless-projects
# cd ~/my-srvless-projects
```

2. Create a simple Python 3 template by running: 

```bash
serverless create --template-url https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-scaleway-functions/tree/master/examples/python3 --path myService
```
You can find other Scaleway templates on [our Github](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-scaleway-functions/tree/master/examples).

### How to edit the serverless.yml file

<Message type="note">

`provider.name` and `plugins` MUST NOT be changed, they enable us to use the scaleway provider

</Message>

This file contains the configuration of one namespace containing one or more functions (in this example, only one) of the same runtime (here `python3`)
The different parameters are:

- `service`: your namespace name
- `provider.runtime`: the runtime of your functions (check the supported runtimes above)
- `provider.env`: environment variables attached to your namespace are injected to all your namespace functions
- `scwToken`: Scaleway **token** you got in prerequisites
- `scwProject`: Scaleway **project id** you got in prerequisites
- `package.patterns`: usually, you do not need to configure it. It enables to include or exclude directories from the deployment
- `functions`: Configure of your fonctions. It is a yml dictionary, with the key being the function name
  - `handler` (Required): file or function which will be executed. See the next section for runtime specific handlers
  - `env` (Optional): environment variables specifics for the current function
  - `minScale` (Optional): how many function instances we keep running (default: 0)
  - `maxScale` (Optional): maximum number of instances this function can scale to (default: 20)
  - `memoryLimit`: ram allocated to the function instances. See the introduction for the list of supported values 
  - `runtime`: (Optional) runtime of the function, if you need to deploy multiple functions with different runtimes in your Serverless Project. If absent, `provider.runtime` will be used to deploy the function.
  - `events` (Optional): List of events to trigger your functions (e.g, trigger a function based on a schedule with `CRONJobs`). See `events` section below

## How to configure your Functions Handler

Based on the chosen runtime, the `handler` variable on function might vary.
For more detail on how to package your dependencies please refer to [How to package your function and upload it as a Zip](/compute/functions/how-to/package-function-in-zip/).

### Node

1. Path to your handler file (from `serverless.yml`), omit `./`, `../`, and add the exported function to use as a handler:

```
# ls
- src
  - handlers
    - firstHandler.js  => module.exports.myFirstHandler = ...
    - secondHandler.js => module.exports.mySecondHandler = ...
- serverless.yml
```

2. In the `serverless.yml` file, launch:
```yml
provider:
  # ...
  runtime: node8 # or node10 or node14
functions:
  first:
    handler: src/handlers/firstHandler.myFirstHandler
  second:
    handler: src/handlers/secondHandler.mySecondHandler
```

3. To add dependencies to your function, include the `node_modules` folder in your package list.

```yml
package:
  patterns:
    - '!.gitignore'
    - '!.git/**'
    - './node_modules/**'
```


### Python

1. Similar to `node`, path to handler file `src/testing/handler.py`:
```
- src
  - handlers
    - firstHandler.py  => def my_first_handler
    - secondHandler.py => def my_second_handler
- serverless.yml
```

2. In `serverless.yml`, launch:
```yml
provider:
  # ...
  runtime: python3 # or python for python 2.7
functions:
  first:
    handler: src/handlers/firstHandler.my_first_handler
  second:
    handler: src/handlers/secondHandler.my_second_handler
```

### Golang
	
If you have the following structure, the path to your handler's **package** should resemble to:
```
- src
  - testing
    - handler.go -> package main in src/testing subdirectory
  - second
    - handler.go -> package main in src/second subdirectory
- serverless.yml
- handler.go -> package main at the root of project
```

Your serverless.yml `functions` should be similar to:
```yml
provider:
  # ...
  runtime: golang
functions:
  main:
    handler: "."
  testing:
    handler: src/testing
  second:
    handler: src/second
```

## How to configure your events

With `events`, you may link your functions with specific triggers, which might include `CRON Schedule (time-based)`, `MQTT Queues` (publish on a topic that will trigger the function), `S3 Object update` (upload an object will trigger the function).

<Message type="note">

We do not include HTTP triggers in our event types, as a HTTP endpoint is created for every function. Triggers are just a new way to trigger your Function, but you will always be able to execute your code via HTTP.

</Message>

Below is a list of supported triggers on Scaleway Serverless, and the configuration parameters required to deploy them:

- **schedule**: Trigger your function based on CRON schedules
  - `rate`: CRON Schedule (UNIX Format) on which your function will be executed
  - `input`: key-value mapping to define arguments that will be passed into your function's event object during execution.

To link a Trigger to your function, you may define a key `events` in your function:

```yml
functions:
  handler: myHandler.handle
  events:
    # "events" is a list of triggers, the first key being the type of trigger.
    - schedule:
        # CRON Job Schedule (UNIX Format)
        rate: '1 * * * *'
        # Input variable are passed in your function's event during execution
        input:
          key: value
          key2: value2
```

You may link Events to your **Containers too** (see section `Managing containers` below for more information on how to deploy containers):

```yaml
custom:
  containers:
    mycontainer:
      directory: my-directory
      # Events key
      events:
        - schedule:
            rate: '1 * * * *'
            input:
              key: value
              key2: value2
```

<Message type="tip">

You may refer to the follow examples:
- [NodeJS-10 with schedule trigger](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-scaleway-functions/tree/master/examples/nodejs10-schedule)

</Message>

## How to access to the Logs

The `serverless logs` command lets you watch the logs of a specific function or container.
Pass the function name you want to fetch the logs for with `--function`

```bash
serverless logs --function <function_name>`
```

## How to delete a project

To remove a project, you may run the following command:

```bash
serverless remove
```

This will remove all your functions, as well as your Scaleway Functions namespace.

<Message type="note">
 
   Your Scaleway Container Registry namespace will not be removed, you will have to delete it manually either via Scaleway console, or Scaleway container registry's API.
