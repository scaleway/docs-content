All Scaleway Dedibox dedicated servers support IPv6. You can request a free `/48` IPv6 prefix for your account, which can be divided into multiple `/56` or `/64` subnets. IPv6 support is available for Dedibox servers located in Paris, Amsterdam, and Warsaw.

The IPv6 prefix is delivered within 30 minutes and is visible on the network configuration page.

  You need to have at least one Dedibox dedicated server to order an IPv6 prefix.

  The DUID (DHCP Unique Identifier) of your prefix and each of its subnets functions like a private key, granting you access to your prefix. It is crucial to keep this identifier confidential and not share it with anyone.
