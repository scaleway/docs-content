LoRaWAN© is a low-power, low-bandwidth, long-range radio protocol used by many devices to send data wirelessly. This protocol is specifically designed for battery-powered devices with little to no installation cost.

LoRaWAN© devices broadcast their data to reachable LoRaWAN© gateways, which forward the messages on the LoRaWAN© operator network. The operator de-duplicates the messages from multiple gateways and hand over the message to the "LoRaWAN© application". In our scenario, the "LoRaWAN© application" is Scaleway IoT Hub.

[Actility](https://www.actility.com) is a LoRaWAN© operator which can build a public or private LoRaWAN© network.

In this tutorial we are going to:

- Create an IoT Hub to receive/send messages from/to LoRaWAN© devices
- Add a device to the Hub to prepare the Actility-to-Scaleway connection
- Set up the Actility backend to use the device credentials to establish a connection with IoT Hub
- Add another device and connect it as a subscribe to receive LoRaWAN© messages

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have [configured your SSH key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- You have [created an IoT Hub](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/create-hub)
- You have [added a device](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/add-device) to your IoT Hub with the **Deny Insecure** option enabled 

</Message>

## Setting up the Actility backend

1. Go to the [Actility Thingpark Enterprise console](https://community.thingpark.io/).

2. Click **Applications > Create** and choose MQTT.

3. Fill in the following parameters (unlisted settings can be anything you like):

    - **Hostname**: Your IoT Hub endpoint, followed by the MQTT port (ex: `iot.fr-par.scw.cloud:8883`).
    - **Account prefix**: Enter `my-app`. This allows you to set the MQTT topic prefix. The messages will be published with under a topic such as the following: `<prefix>/things/<LoRaWAN device ID>/uplink`. 
    - **Protocol**: `SSL`.
    - **MQTT Username**: Your IoT Hub device ID.
    - **MQTT Password**: Leave this field empty.
    - **Certificate**: The device certificate file (ex: `my-device-crt.pem`).
    - **Private Key**: The device key file (ex: `my-device-key.pem`).

4. Click **Save**.

5. Verify if the **Deployment Status** is set to **Opened** in the application page to make sure the application is running. 

Your LoRaWAN© network is now connected to your IoT Hub.

## Subscribe to the LoRaWAN© devices messages

To ensure messages are being properly sent, we will create a new device that will subscribe to the LoRaWAN© devices messages.

1. Create another IoT Hub device, but this time choose the `Allow Insecure` connections setting. Secured connections are not supported over Web Sockets, which the `MQTT Webclient` uses.

2. Click **MQTT Webclient** on the device page. The client will open and connect automatically.

3. Subscribe to the LoRaWAN© devices messages:
  - Click **Add New Topic Subscription** in the **Subscriptions** block
  - Pick any color to identify this subscription
  - Leave QoS 0
  - Use `my-app/things/+/uplink` as the topic. This will instruct the IoT Hub to send you uplink messages from all devices
  - Click **Subscribe**

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-mqtt_webclient_2.webp" alt="" />

Your subscription now appears in the **Subscriptions** block and the messages from your LoRa devices appear in the **Messages** block.

## Setting up a dashboard

You can go further and leverage the power of IoT Hub to build a dashboard and display your data in a few easy steps:

1. [Create a Managed Database Instance](/storage/database/how-to/create-a-database/) for PostgreSQL and a `lora` table with the following fields: `time` (timestamp type) and `data` (jsonb type).

2. Configure a [Database route](/iot/iot-hub/api-cli/cli-db-tips-tricks) to push data into. Set the topic filter as: `my-app/things/+/uplink`. Your query will look like such: 

  ```
  INSERT INTO lora (time, data) VALUES (NOW(), $PAYLOAD)
  ``` 

3. [Create an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance) and [set up Grafana](/tutorials/visualize-timeseries-data-timescaledb-grafana) (You can follow steps 1 to 14 of the tutorial. Do not enable the TimescaleDB option).

4. Add widgets to your dashboard. 

5. Try creating a graph by running the following query:

  ````
  SELECT time, data->'DevEUI_uplink'->'payload'->'batteryLevel' as batteryLevel FROM lora WHERE $__timeFilter(time)
  ```
