Domains and DNS allows you to manage and register your [internal](/domains-and-dns/concepts/#internal-domain) and [external domains](/domains-and-dns/concepts/#external-domain) and configure and manage their DNS zones.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

1. Click **Domains & DNS** in the **Domains & Web Hosting** section of the [Scaleway console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements) side menu.
2. Click the **External domains** tab, then click **+ Manage new domain**.
3. Enter the external domain name in the box and click the search icon to check whether the domain exists. If it does, the estimated cost to add it displays.

4. Click **Manage as external**. The instructions to set up your external domain display. Add a `TXT`record to the root zone of the domain at your current registrar to validate the domain ownership.
      <Message type="note">
        `TXT` means text record. It is used to carry machine-readable data such as information for automated domain validation.
      </Message>
      Copy the token displayed and create a `TXT` record with the name `_scaleway-challenge` within your current DNS zone as instructed:
      <Lightbox image={image2} alt="" />
      <Message type="important">
        The token's presence will be checked regularly. If it has not been set within 48 hours, the external domain will be deleted from the service.
      </Message>
5. Click **Back to external domains** once you have set up the record in your current DNS zone. The list of your external domains displays.

Once the TXT record is validated, the dot next to your domain turns green, and you will receive an email with instructions on how to update your domain's DNS name servers.

Update the name server information at your current registrar once your domain is validated to link your existing domain name with your Scaleway DNS zone.

<Message type="note">
  Scaleway's name servers are:
  * ns0.dom.scw.cloud
  * ns1.dom.scw.cloud
</Message>

You can verify that the association of your domain has been completed by checking the **Name servers** section on the **Domain information** page.

<Message type="important">
  You have a maximum of 14 days to complete the entire process before the external domain gets deleted. You will receive emails reminding you to complete the process on days 7 and 13.
</Message>
