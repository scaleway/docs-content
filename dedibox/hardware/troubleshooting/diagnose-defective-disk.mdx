[Smartmontools](https://www.smartmontools.org/) is a set of tools to control and monitor a disk using the **SMART** standard (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology System).

It consists of two parts:

* `smartd`, a daemon that will allow you to periodically check your hard drives
* `smartctl`, a command line tool to view the status of the hard disk

The tool supports the vast majority of modern hard drives.

## How to check a single-disk server

1. Connect yourself to the server using SSH.

2. Run the following command from the root account (or preceding it with `sudo`):

    ```
    smartctl -a /dev/sda
    ```
    <Message type="note">

    The identifier `sda` is thus referring to your hard disk.

## How to check a Dell Multi-Disk Server

### Dell PERC H200 controller

On these servers, the physical disks are referred to as `sg*` devices

1. Log into your the server using SSH.

2. Run the following commands:

    ```
    smartctl -a -T permissive /dev/sg0
    smartctl -a -T permissive /dev/sg1
    smartctl -a -T permissive /dev/sg2
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
    Sometimes the devices are positioned a little further away.

    Do not hesitate to test up to `sg5` if you don't have conclusive results.

### Dell PERC H310 controller

Two possibilities exist for this type of controller:

* `megaclisas-status` and
* `megacli`

The first one displays the status of the RAID volume, whilst second one displays the SMART status of the disks.

1. Log into your the server using SSH.

2. Update the apt package lists cache and install the required packages:

    ```
    apt update
    apt install megaclisas-status megacli
    ```

3. Run the following command to display the status of the RAID volume: 
    ```
    megaclisas-status
    ```

4. Run the following little script to retrieve the SMART values of your disks:

    ```
    DEVICE=/dev/sda
    for i in $(megacli -pdlist -a0 | grep Id | cut -d":" -f2); do
        echo "============================== $i =============================="
        smartctl -s on -a -d megaraid,${i} ${DEVICE} -T permissive
    done
    ```
## How to check a HP Multi-Disk Server

1. Log into your server using SSH.

2. Run the following command to display the status of the RAID:
    ```
    ssacli ctrl all show config
    ```
    An output similar to the following example displays:
    ```
    Smart Array P410 in Slot 1                (sn: PACCRID111003N3)

    array A (SATA, Unused Space: 0 MB)

        logicaldrive 1 (1.8 TB, RAID 1, OK)

        physicaldrive 1I:1:1 (port 1I:box 1:bay 1, SATA, 2 TB, OK)
        physicaldrive 1I:1:2 (port 1I:box 1:bay 2, SATA, 2 TB, OK)
    ```

3. Run the following commands to display the SMART values of the disks:
    ```
    smartctl -a -d cciss,0 /dev/sg0
    ```
    then run:
    ```
    smartctl -a -d cciss,1 /dev/sg0
    ```

## How to use SMARTD to monitor your disks

`smartd` allows you to monitor your disks and to be alerted (depending on the configuration) by email in case of failure.

<Message type="important">

There is no guarantee as to the result of SMARTD and the time remaining before the disk fails completely. 
However, there is a good chance that you will have time to make a backup and request a replacement.

### How to configure SMARTD

Below, you find an example of a single-disk server installed on a Debian-like machine.

<Message type="note">

The following commands are to be executed as `root` or via `sudo`.

</Message>

1. Log into your server using SSH.

2. Enable basic SMART options:
    ```
    smartctl -s on -o on -S on /dev/sda
    ```
3. Verify, that disk has no problem:
    ```
    smartctl -H /dev/sda
    ```

4. Edit the file `/etc/smartd.conf`, to set up automated tests:

    * Start by commenting out the following line:
    ```
    DEVICESCAN -d removable -n standby -m root -M exec /usr/share/smartmontools/smartd-runner
    ```
    * Then add a line similar to the following example:
    ```
    /dev/sda -a -d sat -o on -S on -s (S/../.././01|L/../1/03) -m root -M exec /usr/share/smartmontools/smartd-runner
    ```
    The above example will allow you to test your hard disk as follows:

        * A short test (S) every day at 1am (01)
        * A long test (L), every Monday (1) at 3am (03)

4. Activate the daemon by uncommenting the line `start_smartd=yes` in the file `/etc/default/smartmontools`.

5. Start the daemon by running the following command: 
    ```
    service smartmontools start
    ```

If a problem is detected, it will send a default mail to root (-m root). 
You can redirect the mails sent to the `root` user to your personal mailbox or to send this mail directly to another address.

### How to run tests manually 


To run SMART tests manually, use the following commands:

* `smartctl -t short /dev/sda` to run a **short** test on your disk
* `smartctl -t long /dev/sda` to run a **long** test on your disk

Once the tests are completed, you can check the results with the following command:

```
smartctl -l selftest /dev/sda
```

## How to report disk failures

If you notice any errors when running a SMART diagonsis on your disk, open a [support ticket](/console/my-account/how-to/open-a-support-ticket/) and ask for the replacement of the disk by indicating the serial number with the result of the smartctl command:
