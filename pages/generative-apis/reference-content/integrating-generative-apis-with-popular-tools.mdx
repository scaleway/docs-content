## OpenAI client libraries

Scaleway Generative APIs follow OpenAI's API structure, making integration straightforward. To get started, you'll need to install the OpenAI library and set up your API key.

### Configuration

To use the OpenAI client library with Scaleway's Generative APIs, first install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install openai
```

Then set the API key and base URL in your OpenAI-compatible client:
```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.scaleway.ai/v1",
    api_key="<API secret key>"
)
```
<Message type="tip">
  Make sure to replace `<API secret key>` with your actual API key.
</Message>

### Using OpenAI client for text generation

To use OpenAI client for text generation, you can create a `client.chat.completions` object and call the `create` method:
```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke about AI"}]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## LangChain (RAG & LLM applications)

LangChain is a popular library for building AI applications. Scaleway's Generative APIs support LangChain for both inference and embeddings.

### Python
<Message type="tip">
  Refer to our dedicated documentation for [implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain and Scaleway Generative APIs](/tutorials/how-to-implement-rag-generativeapis/)
</Message>

## LlamaIndex (advanced RAG applications)

LlamaIndex is an open-source framework for building Large Language Models (LLMs) based applications, especially optimizing RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipelines. 
1. Install the required dependencies to use the LlamaIndex framework with Scaleway's Generative APIs:
    ```bash
    pip install llama-index-llms-openai-like
    ```

2. Create a file `main.py` and add the following code to it to configure the `OpenAILike` client and your secret key:
    ```python
    from llama_index.llms.openai_like import OpenAILike
    from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage

    llm = OpenAILike(
      model="llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
      api_key="<API secret key>",
      api_base="https://api.scaleway.ai/v1",
      max_tokens=512,
      temperature=0.7,
      top_p=1,
      presence_penalty=0,
    )
    ```
    <Message type="tip">
        Make sure to replace `<API secret key>` with your actual API key.
    </Message>

3. You can then interact with the LLM by sending messages to the model with the following code:
    ```python
    response = llm.chat([ChatMessage("Could you tell me about Scaleway please ?")])
    print(response)
    ```

4. Finally, run `main.py`:
    ```python
    python main.py
    ```
    The LLM response should display an answer:
    ```bash
    Generally, Scaleway is a reliable and secure cloud provider that offers a range of services for businesses and developers.
    ```

### Javascript (Typescript)

To perform chat conversations with Langchain, first install `langchain` and `@langchain/openai` packages using your node package manager.

1. Use the following command to install Langchain using `npm` (`yarn` and `pnpm` are also available):
    ```bash
    npm install langchain @langchain/openai
    ```

2. Edit your `package.json` file to ensure it has the `"type": "module"` property:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "module",
      "dependencies": {
        "@langchain/openai": "^0.4.4",
        "langchain": "^0.3.19"
      }
    }
    ```

3. Create a `main.js` file and add the following content to it:
    ```js
    import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

    const chat = new ChatOpenAI({
        apiKey: "<API secret key>",
        model: "llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
        configuration: {
            baseURL: "https://api.scaleway.ai/v1",
        }
      });

    const response = await chat.invoke("Tell me a joke");
    console.log(response.content);
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      Make sure to replace `<API secret key>` with your actual API secret key.
    </Message>

4. Run `main.js`:
    ```bash
    node main.js
    ```
    The model answer should display:
    ```bash
    Why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself? Because it was two-tired.
    ```

Note that other Langchain objects from OpenAI client library are also compatible, such as `OpenAI` and `OpenAIEmbeddings`.


## Continue Dev (AI coding assistance)

Continue Dev is a library that provides AI-powered coding assistance. Scaleway's Generative APIs support Continue Dev for code completion and more.

<Message type="tip">
  Refer to our dedicated documentation for
  - [Integrating Continue Dev with Visual Studio Code](/generative-apis/reference-content/adding-ai-to-vscode-using-continue/)
  - [Integrating Continue Dev with IntelliJ IDEA](/generative-apis/reference-content/adding-ai-to-intellij-using-continue/)
</Message>

## Zed AI (coding assistance)

Zed is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) including AI coding assistance support. Scaleway's Generative APIs supports Zed AI code completion and more.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) for API authentication
- Installed [Zed](https://zed.dev/) on your local machine

### Configure custom endpoints and models

1. Edit Zed settings located in `settings.json`, and add the following content to it:
```json
{
  "language_models": {
    "openai": {
      "api_url": "https://api.scaleway.ai/v1",
      "available_models": [
        {
          "name": "qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct",
          "display_name": "Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B",
          "max_tokens": 128000
        }
      ],
      "version": "1"
    }
  },
  "assistant": {
    "default_model": {
      "provider": "openai",
      "model": "qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct"
    },
    "version": "2"
  }
}
```

This configuration will add a `qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct` Scaleway hosted model available with the Zed `openai` provider, and use it as default model.

2. Open AI Assistant configuration by either using the command palette and typing `assistant: show configuration` or clicking on the bottom right **Assistant Panel** button and then **Assistant menu** in top right and finally **Configure**.

3. Scroll down to the OpenAI Configuration, and paste your Scaleway secret key as API Key credentials. Note that this key will be deleted if you restart Zed. To store it permanently, set up your Scaleway secret key as `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable and restart Zed.

Your setup is complete. If you open a new chat and select `Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B` model, you can send text and retrieve model answers. Additionally, you can also use [Inline Assist](https://zed.dev/docs/assistant/inline-assistant#:~:text=You%20can%20use%20ctrl%2Denter,even%20within%20the%20terminal%20panel.) feature when editing your code.
