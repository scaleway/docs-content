This page shows how to create [credentials](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#credentials) for Scaleway **NATS**, **Queues** and **Topics and Events** (previously grouped together as the **Messaging and Queuing** product). Credentials give their bearer (e.g. services and platforms) access to your service. 

You can create multiple sets of credentials for each of your NATS accounts, and for your Queues and Topics and Events services.

## How to create credentials for a NATS account

Credentials for NATS accounts are not granular: they necessarily give full read and write access. The bearer of these credentials can publish and receive messages, as well as manage topics and streams, for this account.

1. Click **NATS** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. 

2. Use the drop-down menu to select the [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) of the NATS account for which you want to create credentials. The list of your NATS accounts in the pre-selected region displays.

3. Click the NATS account you want to generate credentials for. The account's **Overview** page displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-nats-overview.webp" alt="In the Scaleway console, the Overview tab of a NATS account is displayed. Three panels are visible: account information (URL and region), Credentials, adn Delete NATS account." />

4. In the **Credentials** panel, click **Generate credentials**. A pop-up displays.

5. Enter a name for these credentials, and click **Generate credentials**.

    The credentials are created and a button displays prompting you to download them in a `.creds` file.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-nats-creds.webp" alt="In the Scaleway console, a screen shows that a .creds key file has been generated, which the user is prompted to download." />
    
    <Message type="important">
      The generated credentials are displayed only once. Make sure to download and safely store them before closing the window.
    </Message>

7. Click **Download** and save the file, before closing the window.

    You are returned to your NATs account's overview page. The name of your newly-generated credentials and their access level is displayed in the **Credentials** panel.

## How to create credentials for Queues

Credentials for Queues are granular: you can define the level of access that they should give. Credentials give the specified level of access to all queues that you create in the region they are scoped to.

1. Click **Queues** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. A list of your queues displays.

4. Choose a region that these credentials should be scoped to.

5. Enter a name for these credentials.

6. Select the required permissions for the credentials. You must choose at least one of **Write**, **Read** and **Manage**. You are free to select any combination of these permissions.

7. Click **Generate credentials**.

    The credentials are created. The access key and secret key are displayed, and you are invited to copy them.
    
    <Message type="important">
      This is your only chance to view and save the secret key. Make sure that you copy it and save it somewhere securely.
    </Message>
