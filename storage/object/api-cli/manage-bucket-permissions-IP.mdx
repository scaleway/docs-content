You can stipulate which IP addresses or IP ranges have access or permission to perform S3 operations on your buckets by creating a [bucket policy](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/) with the `IpAddress` or `NotIpAddress` conditions.

It is possible to `Allow` actions for a specific IP address or range of IPs, using the `IpAddress` condition and the `aws:SourceIp` condition key.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="note">
  The `aws:SourceIp` IPv4 and IPv6 values use the standard [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing). For IPv6, we support using the double colon (`::`) to represent strings of `0`.

  - You have [created an Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)

In the example below, we allow the `192.0.2.0/24` IP range to perform the `s3:ListBucket` and `s3:GetObject` actions.

  Replace the example IP addresses before applying your bucket policy or you might lose access to your bucket.

```json
{
  "Version": "2023-04-17",
  "Id": "MyBucketPolicy",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Grant List and GET from my Instances",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": ["s3:ListBucket", "s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": ["<BUCKET_NAME>", "<BUCKET_NAME>/*"],
      "Condition": {
        "IpAddress": {
          "aws:SourceIp": "198.51.100.0/24"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
You can have the same result if you `Deny` actions for IP addresses specified under the `NotIpAddress` condition:
```json
{
  "Version": "2023-04-17",
  "Id": "MyBucketPolicy",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Grant List and GET from my Instances",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": ["s3:ListBucket", "s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": ["<BUCKET_NAME>", "<BUCKET_NAME>/*"],
      "Condition": {
        "NotIpAddress": {
          "aws:SourceIp": "198.51.100.0/24"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
Alternatively, you can block certain IP addresses or IP address ranges from performing actions on your bucket. You can also use `NotIpAddress` with the `Allow` Effect:
```json
{
  "Version": "2023-04-17",
  "Id": "MyBucketPolicy",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Grant List and GET from my Instances",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": ["s3:ListBucket", "s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": ["<BUCKET_NAME>", "<BUCKET_NAME>/*"],
      "Condition": {
        "NotIpAddress": {
          "aws:SourceIp": "2001:db8::/32"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
Or the `Deny` effect paired with the `IpAddress` condition:
```json
{
  "Version": "2023-04-17",
  "Id": "MyBucketPolicy",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Grant List and GET from my Instances",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": ["s3:ListBucket", "s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": ["<BUCKET_NAME>", "<BUCKET_NAME>/*"],
      "Condition": {
        "IpAddress": {
          "aws:SourceIp": "2001:db8::/32"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

  Bucket policies use a JSON-based access policy language. You can find more details on the JSON Policy Grammar [documentation page](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/).
