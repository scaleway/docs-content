<Macro id="requirements" />
  - A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
  - A valid [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
  - Python 3.7+ installed on your system.

## Start with the Generative API Playground

1. Click **Generative APIs** in the **AI** section of the side menu of the Scaleway console. The [Generative APIs dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/generative-apis/) displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the name of the model you want to use. Then click **Try model** in the pop-up menu. The **Playground chat** displays.
    <Message type="note">
      Certain models require you to accept a EULA. Click **Activate** to read and accept the license agreement to enable the model.
    </Message>
3. Type your prompt into the input field. Then click **Run**.
    <Message type="tip">
      You can use the sliders on the right to configure parameters of your request such as Max tokens, temperature, Top P, or presence penalty.
    </Message>
    The output of your request is generated in the area above the input form.

    <Message type="note">
      **Playground resources are limited.** To go further, use the paid service endpoint, with rate limits at 5 requests/second and 2M tokens/minute.
    </Message>

## Install the OpenAI Python SDK

To start using Generative APIs in your code, you need to install the OpenAI Python SDK. Run the following command:

```sh
pip install openai
```

<Message type="tip">
  Ensure Python is installed on your local machine. If you need to install Python, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
</Message>

## Configure and set your API key

1. Have your [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) ready or generate a new one from the Scaleway console.
2. Use the following code in your Python script:

```py
import openai

openai.api_key = "your-scaleway-api-key"
```

Replace `"your-scaleway-api-key"` with the API key obtained from your Scaleway account.

<Message type="tip">
  It is recommended to store your API keys securely using environment variables or secret management tools to prevent unauthorized access.
</Message>

## Send your first API request

You are now ready to make your first API request. Below an example of generating a description of a futuristic city:

```py
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize the client with your base URL and API key
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://bccf05e2-55e1-4e42-aeec-87e153b7e552.ifr.fr-par.scw.cloud/v1",
    api_key="your-scaleway-api-key"
)

# Create a chat completion
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Describe a futuristic city with advanced technology and green energy solutions."}],
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=100,
    top_p=0.9
)

# Output the result
print(completion.choices[0].message["content"])
```

### Example output

Input:

```py
messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Describe a futuristic city with advanced technology and green energy solutions."}]
```

Output:

```
In the heart of this futuristic city, towering skyscrapers are adorned with vertical gardens that purify the air. Autonomous electric vehicles glide silently through streets powered by solar panels embedded in the roadways. At night, the city is illuminated by bioluminescent trees, while energy-efficient buildings harness wind and solar energy. The entire city operates on a smart grid that dynamically adjusts energy distribution, ensuring no power is wasted. Public spaces are vibrant with greenery, creating a seamless blend of nature and technology.
```

This example demonstrates how the Generative API can be used to generate creative content based on your prompts.

## Going further

Now that you're familiar with the basics, explore the full potential of Generative APIs by customizing your API requests. Refer to the [Scaleway API documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/generative-apis/) for more advanced features and usage.
