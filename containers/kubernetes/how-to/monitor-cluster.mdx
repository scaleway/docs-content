  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) 
  - You have [created](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster) a Kubernetes Kapsule cluster
  - You have [activated](/observability/cockpit/how-to/activate-cockpit/) your observability Cockpit

Scaleway's observability Cockpit provides automated monitoring of your Kubernetes cluster. As Kubernetes environments grow in complexity, monitoring becomes crucial for optimal performance. Visualization of the clusters' metrics are available in a hosted Grafana.
Grafana's rich visualizations and ease of use make it an ideal choice. Cockpit offers a hassle-free solution, providing real-time insights without extra infrastructure.

[Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/quickstart/) empowers you to monitor the clusters' control plane, nodes, managed resources and the cluster system applications.
* Detect incidents and diagnose failures in the earliest stages
* Get new insights about control plane and worker nodes usage such as CPU, memory, to optimize your resource allocation
* Achieve a better understanding of your infrastructure by analyzing data on your API server, system applications, up and down scaling behavior

## How to access your Cockpit Grafana dashboard

1. Open your Cockpit in the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/cockpit/overview).
2. Click **Manage Scaleway data**. The Grafana interface opens in a new browser tab.
3. Log into Grafana using your Cockpits' Grafana user and password. The list of your Cockpit dashboards displays.
4. Click **Kubernetes Cluster Overview** in the list of dashboards. A status overview of your cluster displays. This dashboard allows you to monitor multiple components of your Kubernetes cluster: control-plane, nodes, managed resources and cluster system applications.

### Monitoring of the kube-apiserver

The cluster overview dashboard offers real-time monitoring capabilities for the `kube-apiserver` within your Kubernetes cluster. Serving as a crucial component on the control plane, the `kube-apiserver` acts as the gateway to the Kubernetes API, allowing you to interact with the cluster.

In cases where your clusters are large and containing numerous resources such as nodes, pods, and custom resources (CRDs), or when experiencing a large number of simultaneous requests to the apiserver from controllers like argocd and velero, the CPU and memory utilization can surge. As a result, the apiserver's performance may deteriorate significantly, leading to sluggishness or even unresponsiveness, as evidenced by `kubectl` returning an error such as `"EOF"`.

To address this potential issue, it is crucial to monitor the CPU and RAM consumption of the apiserver closely. By doing so, you can proactively manage and reduce the load on the apiserver, thus averting performance bottlenecks.

For scenarios where you require consistent and predictable performance, along with dedicated resources for the apiserver, consider migrating it to a [dedicated contol plane](https://www.scaleway.com/en/kubernetes-dedicated-control-plane/) to ensure optimal performance and stability.

## How to view the Kubernetes control plane logs

1. Open your Cockpit in the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/cockpit/overview).
2. Click **Manage Scaleway data**. The Grafana interface opens in a new browser tab.
3. Log into Grafana using your Cockpits' Grafana user and password. The list of your Cockpit dashboards displays.
4. Click **Kubernetes Cluster Logs** in the list of dashboards. A listing of your control plane logs displays. This dashboard allows you to view the logs of multiple components of your Kubernetes cluster, such as the `controller-manager`, `ccm`, `kapsule-autoscaler`, and more.
    <Message type="note">
      Currently no logs from the `kube-apiserver` are sent to your Cockpit.
