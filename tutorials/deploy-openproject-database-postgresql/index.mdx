## OpenProject - Overview

[OpenProject](https://www.openproject.org/) is an open source project management software. Available in more than 30 languages, it provides tools and features to assist teams with communication, collaboration and navigating the lifecycle of a project.

The software helps to organize projects from their initial stages of [conception, initiation,](https://docs.openproject.org/getting-started/openproject-introduction/#project-concept-and-initiation) [definition and planning](https://docs.openproject.org/getting-started/openproject-introduction/#project-definition-and-planning), to their [launch or execution](https://docs.openproject.org/getting-started/openproject-introduction/#project-launch-or-execution) and provides tools for project [performance, control](https://docs.openproject.org/getting-started/openproject-introduction/#project-performance-and-control) and [closure](https://docs.openproject.org/getting-started/openproject-introduction/#project-close).

In this tutorial you will learn how to install and configure OpenProject on Ubuntu Focal Fossa 20.04 while integrating a [managed database for PostgreSQL](https://www.scaleway.com/en/database/) instance with your stack.

## Installing OpenProject

1. Update and upgrade the system. Then, install the `apt-transport-https` package, which allows the use of repositories accessed via the HTTP Secure protocol (HTTPS).
  ```
  apt update && apt -y upgrade
  apt -y install apt-transport-https
  ```

2. Use the following command to import the PGP key used to sign Open Project packages:
  ```
  wget -qO- https://dl.packager.io/srv/opf/openproject/key | sudo apt-key add -
  ```
  <Message type="note">

  If you are using `sudo` to launch commands with administrator permissions, your password will be requested.

  </Message>

3. Add the OpenProject repository:
  ```
  wget -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/openproject.list \
    https://dl.packager.io/srv/opf/openproject/stable/10/installer/ubuntu/20.04.repo
  ```

4. Update the `apt` package list and install the OpenProject Community Edition
  ```
  apt-get update
  apt-get -y install openproject
  ```

## Creating a Managed Database for PostGreSQL

Since OpenProject requires a PostGreSQL database to run, we will be creating a managed database for PostgreSQL instance directly in the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/rdb/instances/create).

1. In the Storage section of the side menu, click **Database**. Then, click **Create an Instance**. The creation page displays.
<Lightbox src="scaleway-create-a-database-instance.png" alt="" />

2. Choose PostgreSQL as a database engine.

3. You can select the region in which your database will be deployed geographically. Currently we provide the following locations:
    - `FR-PAR`: Paris, France
    - `NL-AMS`: Amsterdam, The Netherlands

4. Under **Configure Instance Options**, select your instance type and check the boxes for **Backup** and **High Availability** if you require them.
<Lightbox src="scaleway-configure-instance-options.png" alt="" />

5. To create your credentials, insert a username and a password in the respective boxes.
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-credentials.png" alt="" />

  <Message type="note">

  Take note of these credentials, as they will be required in a later step.

  </Message>

6. Enter a name for your instance, verify if all selected options are correct and click **Create an Instance** to launch its creation.
<Lightbox src="scaleway-create-db.png" alt="" />

## Configuring the stack

You can easily configure your stack and dependencies with OpenProject's installer.

1. To open the installer, run:
  ```
  openproject configure
  ```

2. Select the **Use an existing PostrgreSQL database** option to use your managed database for PostgreSQL.
<Lightbox src="scaleway-external-database.png" alt="" />

3. Insert the database IP, that is found your database's information **Overview** page:
<Lightbox src="scaleway-postgresql-ip-or-hostname.png" alt="" />

4. Enter the PostGreSQL port:
<Lightbox src="scaleway-dbaas-port.png" alt="" />

5. Insert the username created for your managed database.
<Lightbox src="scaleway-username.png" alt="" />

  And the corresponding password:
<Lightbox src="scaleway-password.png" alt="" />

6. A list of your databases is available in the Database Instance information page, under the **Databases** tab. Select the database that will be used with OpenProject and enter its name in the box:
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-database-name.png" alt="" />
  The installer offers the option of installing and configuring a web server using Apache.

7. Select **Install apache2 server** and press enter.
<Lightbox src="scaleway-install-apache2.png" alt="" />

8. Insert the domain name pointed toward your instance.
<Lightbox src="scaleway-domain-name.png" alt="" />

9. Set a path prefix. If you leave the field empty, the installation will be performed on the root of your domain.
<Lightbox src="scaleway-path-prefix.png" alt="" />
  The wizard will then ask if you wish to enable SSL/TLS.

10. Proceed by selecting **No** and pressing enter.
<Lightbox src="scaleway-enable-ssl.png" alt="" />

  <Message type="note">

  We will enable TLS to secure and encrypt connections between your users and the instance in a later step.

  </Message>

11. You can configure Apache to automatically create and host SVN or Git repositories. If you wish to use SVN, select **Install Subversion repository support**. If you wish to use Git, select **Skip** and then **Install Git repository support**.

  In this tutorial we will install Git.
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-install-git.png" alt="" />

12. Enter the path to the directory that hosts the Git repositories and then the path to the git http backend CGI directory.
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-git-directory.png" alt="" />

13. Select an e-mail application you wish to use to send e-mails from OpenProject and fill in the requested information or **Skip**.
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-send-mail.png" alt="" />

14. Finally, install the Memcache server.
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-memcache.png" alt="" />

  The installation completes. 
  You can access your OpenProject interface through the address `http://<yourdomain.name>/<yourpathprefix>` on the web browser.

## Installing a SSL/TLS certificate

In order to protect user’s credentials and other confidential information that will be stored in OpenProject, you can generate an SSL certificate issued by Let’s Encrypt for free.

For this purpose we will be using a [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/ubuntufocal-other).

1. Make sure the `universe` repository is enabled in Ubuntu.
  ```
  apt-get update
  apt-get install software-properties-common
  add-apt-repository universe
  apt-get update
  ```

2. Install `certbot` by running the command:
  ```
  apt-get install certbot
  ```

3. Run `certbot` while specifying the webroot path as such:
  ```
  certbot certonly --webroot --webroot-path /opt/openproject/public -d domain.name
  ```
  Replace `domain.name` by your domain name.

4. Answer the questions when prompted by the certbot Wizard.
  ```
  Enter email address (used for urgent renewal and security notices) (Enter 'c' to
  cancel):
  ```

  Insert your e-mail address.
    ```
    Please read the Terms of Service at
    https://letsencrypt.org/documents/LE-SA-v1.2-November-15-2017.pdf. You must
    agree in order to register with the ACME server at
    https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    (A)gree/(C)ancel: A
    ```

  Type `A` to agree.
    ```
    Would you be willing to share your email address with the Electronic Frontier
    Foundation, a founding partner of the Let's Encrypt project and the non-profit
    organization that develops Certbot? We'd like to send you email about our work
    encrypting the web, EFF news, campaigns, and ways to support digital freedom.

    (Y)es/(N)o:
    ```

  Choose `Y`es or `N`o and input accordingly.

  The Wizard will then generate your certificate. Once done, it will provide you the path of the certificate and the private key, as well as inform you the expiration date of the certification.
    ```
    Obtaining a new certificate
    Performing the following challenges:
    http-01 challenge for openproject-scw.ga
    Using the webroot path /opt/openproject/public for all unmatched domains.
    Waiting for verification...
    Cleaning up challenges

    IMPORTANT NOTES:
    - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
      /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.name/fullchain.pem
      Your key file has been saved at:
      /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.name/privkey.pem
      Your cert will expire on 2020-10-20. To obtain a new or tweaked
      version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot
      again. To non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run
      "certbot renew"
    - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
      configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
      secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
      also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
      making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
    ```

  Take note of the paths provided as they will be required in a later step.

## Enabling TLS/SSL

1. Re-launch the OpenProject installer by running the command:
  ```
  openproject reconfigure
  ```

  The installation Wizard launches the same prompts as before. Select the same preferences and enter your answers, if necessary, until you reach the `server/ssl` screen.

2. Select `Yes` and enter. When prompted, insert the path to your certificate:
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-path-to-ssl-certificate.png" alt="" />

  To your private key:
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-path-to-private-key.png" alt="" />

  And a path to your CA bundle (if you have one).

  Follow through the remaining prompts by entering `< OK >` every time. The wizard will close and your new configuration will be applied.

## Accessing your OpenProject dashboard

To begin editing and configuring your OpenProject workspace you must login.

1. Open a web browser and enter `https://<yourdomain.name>/<yourpathprefix>/login`

2. To login as the `admin` user, enter the following credentials:
  ```
  Username: admin
  Password: admin
  ```
  Upon the first login, you will be required to change your password.

Once you have done so, you can begin managing your projects. OpenProject provides a [documentation website](https://docs.openproject.org/) and a [user guide](https://docs.openproject.org/user-guide/) is available to help you get started with their different features.
