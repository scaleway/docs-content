3. Scroll down to the **Delete your labeling workspace** section.

  <Message type="important">

  Deleting your labeling workspace **deletes all your annotations**. Make sure you have exported them, to avoid data loss.

  </Message>

  <Message type="note">

  Deleting the labeling workspace does **not** delete the associated S3 buckets. To avoid incurring Object Storage costs, it is recommended to delete the buckets separately if you no longer need the data.
