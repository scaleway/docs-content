You can now migrate your Online.net Web Hosting Classic plan to Scaleway's new Web Hosting platform. This migration brings you better performance and an improved user experience. Benefits of the migration include:

- **Enhanced control with cPanel:** cPanel provides an interface that allows for more granular control over your hosting environment. This ensures a straightforward management experience.
- **Improved performance:** Migrating to cPanel can result in noticeable performance improvements. Expect more efficient resource utilization and faster loading times for your websites and applications.
- **Up-to-date system:** cPanel's regular updates contribute to an up-to-date and secure hosting environment. This ensures that your system remains resilient in the face of evolving digital challenges.
- **A wide range of features:** Explore a range of features offered by cPanel, covering file management, security options, email functionality, and database management. These features collectively form a powerful toolkit to address diverse hosting requirements.

You can initiate the migration of your Web Hosting plan directly from your [Dedibox/Online.net console](https://console.online.net/). For further information, refer to our dedicated documentation [How to migrate an Online.net/Dedibox web hosting plan to Scaleway](/managed-services/webhosting/how-to/migrate-webhosting-plan/).

## What will my new hosting plan be?

Once you have [initiated the migration](/managed-services/webhosting/how-to/migrate-webhosting-plan/) of your Online.net hosting plan it will be transferred to Scaleway. Your existing offer will be transferred to the temporary **migration plan** and you can then choose one of Scaleway's [Web Hosting plans](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/?tags=available,managedservices-webdevelopment-webhosting) that suits best your needs.

<Message type="important">
    You are required to switch your hosting plan to one of our new [Web Hosting plans](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/?tags=available,managedservices-webdevelopment-webhosting) once the migration of your data has been completed.
