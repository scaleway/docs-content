## How can I register for the Distributed Data Lab private beta?

You can request access to the Distributed Data Lab private beta by email via the [Scaleway betas](https://www.scaleway.com/fr/betas/#distributed-data-lab) page.

## What is Apache Spark?

Apache Spark is an open-source unified analytics engine designed for large-scale data processing. It provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. Spark offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs.

## How does Apache Spark work?

Apache Spark processes data in memory, which allows it to perform tasks up to 100 times faster than traditional disk-based processing frameworks like Hadoop MapReduce. It uses Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) to store data across multiple nodes in a cluster and perform parallel operations on this data.

## How am I billed for Distributed Data Labs?

During the private beta, Scaleway Distributed Data Labs is free.
