You can monitor the activity of your Serverless Jobs using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) to check the current status, RAM, and CPU consumption of your runs. Also, Serverless Jobs is fully integrated into Scaleway’s Observability [Cockpit](/cockpit/quickstart/), and allows you to quickly access your logs.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a Serverless Job](/serverless-jobs/how-to/create-job/)

## How to monitor Jobs from the Scaleway console

1. Click **Jobs** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The jobs page displays.

2. Click the name of the job you want to monitor. The **Overview** tab displays:
    - The **Job definition** section contains the parameters of your Serverless job, and provides the following elements:
      - Region
      - Provisioned mvCPU and memory
      - Provisioned ephemeral storage
      - Container image used
      - Cron schedule
    - The **Job runs** section lists all the executions of your Serverless job, and provides the following elements:
      - Status (running, succeeded, canceled, or failed)
      - Run ID
      - Starting date
      - End date
      - Duration

      <Message type="note">
      Previous job runs are retained for a duration of 60 days.
      </Message>

3. From the job overview:
    - Select the **Logs** tab, then click **Open Grafana logs dashboard** to access the logs of the job.
    - Select the **Metrics** tab, then click **Open Grafana metrics dashboard** to access the metrics of the job.

## How to access the Grafana dashboard

Scaleway Cockpit allows you to monitor your applications and their infrastructure by giving you access to metrics, logs, and traces in Grafana dashboards.

1. From the Scaleway console [Cockpit overview page](https://console.scaleway.com/cockpit/overview), click **Access Grafana** in the top right corner.

3. From the **Scaleway Dashboards** panel, select:
    - **Serverless Functions logs** to access the logs of your functions.
    - **Serverless Functions Overview** to access the metrics of your functions.

  You are directed to the selected dashboard. You can use the filters at the top of the page to refine the displayed information.

  You can also access your Serverless Functions logs and metrics from the [console](https://console.scaleway.com) via the **Logging** and **Metrics** tabs of a function.
