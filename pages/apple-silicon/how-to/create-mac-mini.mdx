This page shows how to create your first [Mac mini](/apple-silicon/concepts/#mac-mini) with the Scaleway console.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)

<Message type="important">
  Due to license constraints, the minimum lease for Apple silicon is 24 hours. As a result, the earliest you can delete a Mac mini is 24 hours after the start of its lease.

1. Click [Apple silicon](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elementsasaas/servers) in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu. The [Apple silicon splash page](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elementsasaas/servers) displays.
    <Message type="note">
      Should your account already contain Mac minis, a list of these will be displayed rather than the Apple silicon splash page.
      Alongside, you will see a (+ Create Mac mini) button, which you can click to create a new Mac mini.

2. Click **Create Mac mini**. The Mac mini creation wizard displays.
3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Select the commitment plan for your Mac mini. Two options are available:
       - **No commitment:** You can terminate the subscription of your Mac mini at any time after the initial 24 hours, a mandatory period required by Apple's software license. [Learn more about Apple's software license requirements (Section 3.A)](https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/macOSSequoia.pdf).
       - **Commitment:** You subscribe to a [commitment plan for Apple silicon](/apple-silicon/concepts/#commitment-plan) and benefit from a discounted monthly price based on your choice.
      <Message type="important">
        Currently, it is not possible to switch from a monthly commitment to hourly billing.

    - Choose an **Availability Zone**, which is the geographical region where your Mac mini will be deployed. The available Mac mini configurations depend on the Availability Zone:
      - Mac mini M4, M2 pro, and M2 are available in PARIS 1
      - Mac mini M1 are available in PARIS 3
    - Choose a macOS version. Note that if you choose a macOS other than the one installed by default, there will be a delay of about 1 hour before the Mac mini is made available.
    - Optionally, configure the available public bandwidth for your server. This option may not be available for all offers.
    - Choose whether to activate the **Private Networks 1 Gbps** feature. This lets you attach your Mac mini to one or more Scaleway Private Networks in a [VPC](/vpc/), enabling secure communication with other attached resources.
    - Enter a **Name** for your Mac mini, or leave the randomly-generated name in place.
    - Verify the **Estimated cost** for your Mac mini based on your chosen specifications.
4. Tick the checkbox to agree to the Bare Metal specific conditions and the macOS License Agreement.
5. Click **Create Mac mini** to finish. The installation of your Apple silicon is launched, and you are informed when it is ready.
