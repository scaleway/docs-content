The DNS resolution failure has been resolved. To fix the issue, please proceed as follows:

- Replace or reboot your nodes to get the fix.
- Use a fqdn to resolve your addresses inside the Private Network. Meaning if you have a `foo` service in the `mypn` pn `foo` will not be resolved and you must use `foo.mypn`

Important notes:
- Please avoid using an existing TLD (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain) as PN name if you do so you can have some problem. For instance, if you name your pn `fr` you will not be able to resolve `google.fr` externally, meaning if you have not a service named google in your PN you wonâ€™t revsolv `google.fr` and if you have one, it will not be the good one.
- Please note that `prod` and `dev` are TLD (https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt)
