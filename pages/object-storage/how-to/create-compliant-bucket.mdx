It is crucial to follow the recommendations outlined in the [shared responsibility model](/object-storage/reference-content/) when hosting health data to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, such as data protection laws and industry standards.

Adhering to these guidelines helps safeguard sensitive information against unauthorized access, breaches, and data loss, while also clarifying the roles and responsibilities between the cloud provider and the customer.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to create a compliant Object Storage bucket to host healthcare data

Even though you can use an existing bucket to host healthcare data, we strongly recommend you create a dedicated bucket for this purpose. This is to make sure that no lifecycle rule exists, and that every object uploaded to this bucket is properly encrypted.

1. Click **Object Storage** on the left side menu of the console. The Object Storage dashboard displays.

2. Click **+ Create bucket**. The bucket creation page displays.

3. Enter a **name** for your bucket.

4. Select the **Paris** region.

5. Set the bucket visibility to **Private**.

6. Select a **use case** for your bucket.

7. Enable [bucket versioning](/object-storage/how-to/use-bucket-versioning/) if you want to store multiple versions of your objects (this may lead to higher storage costs).

8. Optionally, you can use the cost estimator to simulate your Object Storage costs.

10. Click **Create bucket** to confirm.

Your bucket is now ready to store healthcare data. Refer to the section below for information on how to encrypt your objects.

## Compliant methods to encrypt objects

Objects in a compliant bucket must be encrypted to make sure data is protected. To achieve this, several options are available:

- Scaleway's SSE-C (**S**erver-**S**ide **E**ncryption with **C**ustomer-provided keys) mechanism garantees that objects uploaded to the bucket are properly encrypted.

- Customer-side encryption mechanisms to upload objects that are already encrypted. This method must be used in combination with [Scaleway's HDS-compliant deletion method]().

## Compliant methods to delete objects

### SSE-C

If you use Scaleway's SSE-C to encrypt your data, using [DeleteObject](/object-storage/api-cli/object-operations/#deleteobject) is sufficient to garantee that your object is deleted in compliance with the regulatory requirements. 

### Customer-side encrpytion methods

<Message type="note">
This mechanism is designed to handle compliant deletion of your data, and not its encryption. Make sure to use it in combination with a compliant encryption method, such as SSE-C or any other customer-side approach to upload your objects.
</Message>

## Compliant bucket creation checklist

Make sure that your bucket follows the requirements below:

- Your bucket must be created in the **France - Paris** (`fr-par`) region.
- Your bucket must not have active lifecycle rules
- Your objects within this bucket must not be stored using the **Glacier** storage class.
- You must use a valid encryption and deletion method (as explained above)
- You must follow the provided security best practices at all times

## Enforcing compliance using bucket policies

To enforce compliance regarding the storage class and lifecycle rules, you can set up a bucket policy. Bucket policies deny any action that is not explicitly allowed in a statement, allowing for fine-grained permissions management.

Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/object-storage/api-cli/bucket-policy/) for more information on bucket policies.
