<Message type="important">
  * Make sure to check your domain name for any spelling mistakes before you place the order.
  * You cannot change the domain name once the registration is complete and the fees will still apply. You can of course register another domain with the correctly spelled name.
  * Internal domains are billed immediately upon registration.
