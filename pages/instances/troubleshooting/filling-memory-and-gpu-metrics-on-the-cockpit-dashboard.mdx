## Problem
The memory panel in the `Instance Overview` dashboard or the `Instance GPUs`
dashboard do not display any metrics.

### Symptoms
- No metrics are displayed in the `Instance Overview` Cockpit dashboard.
- No GPU metrics appear in the `Instances GPUs` Cockpit dashboard (for offers with GPUs only)

## Cause
The `scaleway-vmagent` service is either:
- Not installed on the Instance, or
- Not running properly.
<Message type="important">
  The `scaleway-vmagent` is necessary to collect and report some system metrics (including memory and GPU usage) to the Cockpit Instance dashboards.
</Message>

## Solution
- Verify that the `scaleway-vmagent` service is running and enabled:
    ```bash
    systemctl status scaleway-vmagent
    ```
- If missing, install the `scaleway-vmagent` package:

    For Ubuntu: Check that the [Scaleway PPA](https://launchpad.net/~scaleway/+archive/ubuntu/stable) is added before installing:

    ```bash
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:scaleway/stable
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install scaleway-vmagent
    ```

    For RHEL-based distributions: check that the [Scaleway COPR repository](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/scaleway/stable/) is enabled before installing:
    ```bash
    dnf copr enable @scaleway/instance
    dnf install scaleway-vmagent
    ```
<Message type="note">
  On RHEL, services are not started after install. You may either start `scaleway-vmagent` manually, or wait for the next boot.
</Message>

Once the service is running, metrics should begin appearing in the Cockpit dashboards within a few minutes.

<Message type="note">
  If your Instance has been running for more than a few weeks, its current hardware configuration may not be compatible with `vmagent`. In this case, we strongly recommend **restarting it via the console or the API**. This is because a restart using the console will update the virtual machine configuration to support the agent, whereas a restart from within the guest will not.
