You can view your Messaging and Queuing metrics via [Scaleway Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/quickstart/). This allows you to monitor your queues/streams and messages at a glance.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />
 
<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) 
  - You have [created a Messaging and Queuing namespace](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-namespace/)
</Message>

## How to activate your Cockpit

Scaleway Cockpit is deactivated by default, but you can easily activate it in the Scaleway console by following the procedure detailed [here](/observability/cockpit/how-to/activate-cockpit/).

## How to access the Grafana dashboard

To view your Messaging and Queuing metrics, use the Grafana dashboard which is accessible from the Scaleway console:
  - First you must create a user and their associated credentials (a username and password) for Grafana
  - Then, you can use these credentials to access the Grafana dashboard for your Messaging and Queuing namespace, via the Scaleway console.

1. Create a Grafana user and retrieve their username and password by [following this procedure](/observability/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/).

2. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu.

3. Click the **namespace** you want to view metrics for, followed by the **Metrics** tab.

4. Click **Open Grafana metrics dashboard**.

5. Enter your Grafana username and password to log in.

    You are directed to the dashboard for your Messaging and Queuing namespace, where you can view all your metrics.
