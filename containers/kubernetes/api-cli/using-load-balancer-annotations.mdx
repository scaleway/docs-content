<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/) a Scaleway Kubernetes cluster
</Message>

This link defines how Load Balancer [services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#internal-load-balancer) (`type: Load Balancer`) annotations are working.

For Scaleway Load Balancers annotations are prefixed with `service.beta.kubernetes.io/`. For example:

```yaml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/scw-loadbalancer-forward-port-algorithm: "roundrobin"
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/scw-loadbalancer-health-check-delay: "10s"
spec:
  ...
```

## Load balancer properties

You can get a list of working annotations in the Scaleway Load Balancer [documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/load-balancer/zoned-api/).

<Message type="note">
  - If an invalid mode is passed in the annotation, the service will output an error.
  - If an annotation is not specified, the cloud controller manager will apply the default configuration.
