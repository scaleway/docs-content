<Message type="note">
Managed MongoDBÂ® is currently not compatible with the [Static NAT](/public-gateways/concepts/#nat) feature of [Scaleway Public Gateways](/public-gateways/concepts/#public-gateway). Instead, you can use Public Gateways' [SSH bastion](/public-gateways/how-to/use-ssh-bastion/) feature and perform port forwarding. Follow the steps below to connect using SSH bastion.
</Message>

If you want to connect locally to a Database Instance that is not accessible via the public internet, you can use SSH Bastion and connect it to the same Private Network the Database Instance is connected to.

1. Open an SSH tunnel with port forwarding:

    ```
    ssh -L local_port:instance_id.network_id.internal:27017 bastion@gatewayIP -p 61000 -N
    ```

2. Connect using `mongosh`:

    ```
    mongosh --host localhost --port local_port --username "username"
    ```
