Domains and DNS allows you to manage and register your internal and external domains and configure and manage their DNS zones. Register and (auto-)renew your domains easily! Domains and DNS provide support for queries via both IPv4 and IPv6.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) 
</Message>

1. Click **DNS** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Domains and DNS dashboard displays. Click the **External Domains** tab, then click **Manage a new domain**.
2. Enter the external domain name in the box and click the search icon to check if the domain exists. Once verified, the following message displays:
      <Lightbox src="scaleway-dns-domain-validated.webp" alt="" />
3. Click **Next** to validate your domain name. The validation instructions display. Add a `TXT`record to the root zone of the domain at your current registrar to validate the domain ownership.
      <Message type="note">
        `TXT` means text record. It is used to carry machine-readable data such as information for automated domain validation.
      </Message>
      Copy the token displayed and create a `TXT` record with the name `_scaleway-challenge` within your current DNS zone as instructed:
      <Lightbox src="scaleway-dns-validation-token.webp" alt="" />
      <Message type="important">
        The token's presence will be checked regularly. If it has not been set within 48 hours, the external domain will be deleted from the service.
      </Message>
4. Click **Manage as External Domain** once you have set up the record in your current DNS zone. The list of your external domains displays. The status of any ongoing DNS challenges is visible through a blue dot on the left-side of the domain name:
      <Lightbox src="scaleway-dns-ongoing-validation.webp" alt="" />

Once the record has been validated, the dot turns green and you will receive an e-mail with further instructions on how to update your domain's DNS servers.

Update the nameserver information at your current registrar once the domain name is validated in order to link your existing domain name with your Scaleway Domains DNS zone. 
<Message type="note">
  Scaleway's DNS servers are:
  * ns0.dom.scw.cloud
  * ns1.dom.scw.cloud
</Message>

You can verify if the association of your domain has been successfully completed by checking the Nameservers list in the **Domain Information** page. 

<Message type="important">
  If the entire process is not completed after 14 days, the domains are deleted from the DNS and you will have to start over. E-mails reminding you to complete the process are sent on days 7 and 13.
