## Problem

I cannot see previous job runs in the history of my Serverless Job.

## Cause

Serverless Jobs have a retention period of 60 days for job runs history. Older job runs are not visible.

## Possible solutions

You can use the [Scaleway Serverless Jobs API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-jobs/#path-job-runs-list-all-job-runs-with-filters) or the [Scaleway CLI](https://cli.scaleway.com/jobs/#list-all-job-runs-with-filters) to periodically list and save previous job runs for archival purposes.

Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/serverless-jobs/how-to/automate-resources-management/) for more information on how to automatically save job runs on a recurring schedule.
