Scaleway NATS, Queues, and Topics and Events are [message broker](/messaging/concepts/#messaging-and-queuing) tools that allows you to transfer messages between different microservices and platforms. This enables them to "talk" to each other effectively even if they are not otherwise compatible. These brokers enable and simplify microservices application development and allows you to build highly scalable, reliable, distributed applications.

NATS, Queues, and Topics and Events were previously grouped together as the Messaging and Queuing product, and have now become three separate products in their own right. Read on to learn how to get started with your product of choice

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## Quickstart for NATS

### How to create a NATS account

To start using a NATS message broker, you must first create a NATS account. This sets a scope for your NATS credentials, messages, queues and stream.

1. Click **NATS** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. 

2. Click **Create a NATS account**. The creation wizard displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-nats-create-account.webp" alt="In the Scaleway console, the Create a NATS Account screen displays. The different parts of the page are detailed in the steps below." />

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:

    - Choose a **region**, which is the geographical location in which your NATS account will be created.
    - Enter a **name** for your NATS account, or use the auto-generated name suggested for you.
    - Optional: Use the *Estimated cost** calculator to simulate how messages sent and stored with NATS streams will be billed. Note that simply creating a NATS account does not in itself incur any billing. For more information about NATS billing, see the [FAQ](/faq/messaging-and-queuing/#how-are-nats-queues-and-topics-and-events-billed).
    - Click **Create NATS account** to finish.

    You are directed to the listing of your NATS accounts, where your newly-created NATS account now appears.

### How to create NATS credentials

Credentials for NATS accounts are not granular: they necessarily give full read and write access. The bearer of these credentials can publish and receive messages, as well as manage topics and streams, for this account.

1. Click **NATS** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. 

2. Use the drop-down menu to select the [region](/messaging/concepts/#region) of the NATS account for which you want to create credentials. The list of your NATS accounts in the pre-selected region displays.

3. Click the NATS account you want to generate credentials for. The account's **Overview** page displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-nats-overview.webp" alt="In the Scaleway console, the Overview tab of a NATS account is displayed. Three panels are visible: account information (URL and region), Credentials, adn Delete NATS account." />

4. In the **Credentials** panel, click **Generate credentials**. A pop-up displays.

6. Enter a name for these credentials, and click **Generate credentials**.

    The credentials are created and a button displays prompting you to download them in a `.creds` file.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-nats-creds.webp" alt="In the Scaleway console, a screen shows that a .creds key file has been generated, which the user is prompted to download." />
    
    <Message type="important">
      The generated credentials are displayed only once. Make sure to download and safely store them before closing the window.
    </Message>

7. Click **Download** and save the file, before closing the window.

    You are returned to your NATs account's overview page. The name of your newly-generated credentials and their access level is displayed in the **Credentials** panel.

### How to create and manage queues, messages and streams

All further actions related to publishing, processing and managing messages, subjects, queues and streams can be done via a supported CLI or SDK. See our documentation on [NATS CLI and SDKs](/messaging/reference-content/nats-overview/#further-actions-nats-cli-and-nats-sdk) for more information. You can also check out our tutorial on [creating a serverless architecture for handling large messages](/tutorials/large-messages/) with Scaleway Messaging and Queuing NATS.

### How to delete a NATS account

1. Click **NATS** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu.

2. Use the drop-down menu to select the [region](/messaging/concepts/#region) containing the NATS account you want to delete.

3. Click the NATS account you want to delete.

4. In the bottom panel, click the **Delete NATS account** button.

    A pop-up displays, reminding you that the action is irreversible, and any associated queued messages and credentials will be deleted.

5. Type `DELETE` and click **Delete NATS account** to confirm.


## Quickstart for Queues

### How to create credentials for Queues

Credentials for Queues are granular: you can define the level of access that they should give. Credentials give the specified level of access to all queues that you create in the region they are scoped to.

1. Click **Queues** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. A list of your queues displays.

2. Click the **Credentials** tab.

3. Click **Generate credentials**. A pop-up displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-queues-gen-creds.webp" alt="In the Scaleway console, the Generate credentials screen displays. It prompts the user to choose a region for their credentials, a name, and permissions (write, read and/or manage)" />

4. Choose a region that these credentials should be scoped to.

5. Enter a name for these credentials.

6. Select the required permissions for the credentials. You must choose at least one of **Write**, **Read** and **Manage**. You are free to select any combination of these permissions.

7. Click **Generate credentials**.

    The credentials are created. The access key and secret key are displayed, and you are invited to copy them.
    
    <Message type="important">
      This is your only chance to view and save the secret key. Make sure that you copy it and save it somewhere securely.
    </Message>

8. Copy and save the credentials, before closing the window.

    You are returned to the **Credentials** tab. The name of your newly-generated credentials, along with the access key and access level are displayed.

### How to create queues

1. Click **Queues** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu.

2. Click **Create queue**. The queue creation wizard displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-queues-create-queue.webp" alt="In the Scaleway console, the Create a Queue screen displays. The different sections of the screen are described in the steps below." />

3. Select the [region](/messaging/concepts/#region) in which you want to create the queue.

4. Enter a **name** for your queue. The name must be no more than 80 characters, and consist only of alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. Alternatively, you can go with the auto-generated name suggested for you.

5. Choose your **Queue type**, from one of the following:
    - **Standard**: Standard Queues ensure at-least-once delivery. The exact order of messages in the queue is not preserved.
    - **FIFO**: FIFO Queues (**F**irst **In** **F**irst **O**ut) preserves the exact ordering of messages.

6. Configure your queue's **parameters**. The following parameters can be defined:
    - **Visibility timeout**: The length of time (in seconds) during which, after a message is received, it is hidden and cannot be received again by the same or other consumers. This is useful as the queue itself does not automatically delete messages once they are received, and so prevents consumers from receiving the same message many times before they have finished processing it. Therefore, the value set here should be informed by the expected length of time it will take consumers to process messages. The default value is 30 seconds. The value must be between 1 second and 43 200 seconds (12 hours).
    - **Message retention period**: The length of time (in seconds) that messages are kept in the queue before being deleted. Setting a longer message retention period allows for a longer interval between a message being sent and it being received. The default value is 60 seconds. The value must be between 60 seconds and 1 290 600 seconds (14 days).
    - **Maximum message size**: The maximum size (in kilobytes) of a message that can be sent to the queue. Messages greater than the defined size will be rejected. The default value is 256 KB. The value must be between 1 KB and 256 KB.
    - **Content Based Deduplication**: This setting is only available for FIFO queues. Enable content-based deduplication if the message body is guaranteed to be unique for each message. A unique hash value is generated from the body of each message, which is used as its deduplication ID. This avoids the need to set a deduplication ID when sending messages.

7. Click **Create queue** to finish.

You are returned to the **Queues** tab, where your newly-created queue now displays. The queue's URL is also displayed here, for use in your API/CLI operations.

### How to send and receive messages

All further actions related to sending messages to queues can be done via a supported CLI or SDK. See our documentation on the [SQS CLI and SDKs](/messaging/reference-content/sqs-overview#further-actions) for more information. You can also check out [our tutorial](/tutorials/create-serverless-scraping/) on creating a serverless scraping architecture with Scaleway Queues.

### How to delete a queue

When you no longer want a queue, you can delete it. This action is irreversible and deletes the queue along with any queued messages.

1. Click **Queues** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu.

2. Use the drop-down menu to select the [region](/messaging/concepts/#region) of the queue you want to configure.
