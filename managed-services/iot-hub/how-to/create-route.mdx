Routes allow your IoT Hub to forward messages to non-MQTT destinations.

Currently, the following routes are available:

 - **REST Route** allowing you to call a REST API with the content of your messages.
 - **Database Route** allowing you to execute queries on a PostgreSQL or MySQL database with the content of your messages.
 - **Scaleway Object Storage Route** allowing you to store your messages in your Scaleway [Object Storage](https://www.scaleway.com/en/object-storage/) bucket.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created an IoT Hub](/managed-services/iot-hub/how-to/create-hub)

5. Complete the following steps of the wizard:
    - Enter a name for your route.
    - Enter the topic filter you want your route to subscribe to. This topic filter can contain wildcards (`+` and `#`).
    - Choose the type of Route you want to create.
    - Configure the settings according to the type of route.
      - For an **Object Storage** Route:
        - Select the region of your Object Storage bucket.
        - Choose the bucket you want to store messages in (you cannot directly create a bucket from the «Object Storage» Route screen).
        - Enter the prefix that will be prepended to object names.
        - Select how your messages will be stored in the bucket (`per topic` or `per message`).
      - For a **Managed Databases** Route:
        - Enter the SQL query to be executed when the topic filter is matched.
        - Enter the settings to access to the database:
          - **Engine**: PostgreSQL or MySQL
          - **Host**: host name or IP address
          - **Port**: port number
          - **Name**: name of the database
          - **Username**: username to use while connecting to the database
          - **Password**: password of the user
      - For a **REST** Route:
        - Choose the HTTP Verb used to call the URI.
        - Enter the REST Route endpoint.
        - Add optional HTTP headers.
6. Click **Add new route** to create the route.
