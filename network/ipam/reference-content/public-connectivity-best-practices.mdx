This document sets out best practices for securing and optimizing public connectivity for your Scaleway resources.

## Public vs private connectivity

Public vs private connectivity defines how resources are accessed and exposed over networks.

* **Public connectivity**: Your resource has a [public IP address](TODO) and is reachable over the public internet. Anyone with the right credentials can access the resource via its public IP address, e.g. over an [SSH connection](TODO) or simply by directly accessing its IP address in a browser to retrieve and display any content it is serving, e.g. over HTTP.

* **Private connectivity**: Your resources is reachable over an attached [Private Network](TODO). The resource has a [private IP address](TODO), but it can only be accessed via this address from within the Private Network. Such a resource may or may not also have a public IP address.

## IP address management

### Flexible IP addresses: definition

Public connectivity for **Instances**, **Elastic Metal**, **Load Balancers** and **Public Gateways** is facilitated by a [flexible IP address](TODO). 

- A flexible IP address is a public IP address that you can attach and detach from the resource at will. 
- If you detach it, it returns to the pool of flexible IP addresses kept in your account for that product, and you can attach it to a different resource (or reattach it to the same one as before).
- Flexible IP addresses are scoped to a single product and a single Availability Zone (AZ). If you create a flexible IP address for an Instance in PAR-2, you can move it to a different Instance in PAR-2, but not to an Instance in PAR-1, nor to an Elastic Metal server in any AZ.

Other resource types generally facilitate public connectivity in other ways, e.g. via public endpoints that cannot be modified by the user. Public connectivity may be mandatory with no option to deactivate (e.g. for Apple Silicon), or optional (e.g. for Managed Database). See the specific documentation for the product in question to find out more.

### Exploiting the benefits of flexible IPs

As flexible IP addresses can be moved between resources, they provide the following advantages: 

**Seamless failover and disaster recovery**: If your Instance, for example, goes down, you can move its public IP to a different Instance in the same AZ to ensure the service remains available.
**Zero downtime during maintenance and migration**: When you need to carry out updates, migrations or maintenance on a resource, you can temporarily move its public IP to a backup resource to avoid disruption for users.
**IP retention and consistent endpoints**: Maintaining the same IP avoids the need for frequent DNS or firewall rule updates, and makes it easier to manage your dynamic cloud environments.

In the future, look out for even more improvements to our flexible IP offering, such as the ability to move flexible IPs between different types of products, and to manage all your public flexible IPs from your [IPAM](todo) dashboard.

### Limiting public connectivity, prioritizing Private Networks

We strongly recommend that you disable public connectivity on all of your Scaleway resources, unless it is absolutely required. Attaching resources to Private Networks, and limiting their communication to these networks brings the following advantages:

- **Minimized attack surface**: Without a public IP address, the resource is not exposed directly to the internet, decreasing the risk of DDoS or brute force attacks, or unauthorized access.
- **Reduced cost**: Public (flexible) IP addresses are [billed](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/), whereas Private Networks and the private IP addresses that attach resources to Private Networks are free of charge (except for Elastic Metal servers). 
- **Improved latency**: Communication between resources over a Private Network is generally faster, as it does not need to be routed through the public internet.

Favor resources such as Public Gateways and Load Balancers to provide access to the public internet over the Private Network. This allows Instances and other attached resources to send and receive packets to the internet through a single, secure point of access.

Find out more about how to get the most from Private Networks, and how to expose Private Networks to the internet in our [dedicated documentation](/network/vpc/reference-content/getting-most-private-networks/#exposing-a-private-network-to-the-internet)

## Implementing security controls

Different products offer different security features and controls to help place limits and restrictions on the traffic arriving over your resource's public interface. We strongly recommend that you implement all available measures to minimize security risk and optimize the security of your resource. Some of the available security controls are listed below.

### Instances: Security groups

[Security groups](/compute/instances/concepts/#security-group) act as firewalls, filtering public internet traffic on your Instances. They can be stateful or stateless, and allow you to create rules to drop or allow public traffic to and from your Instance. [Find out how to create and configure security groups](/compute/instances/how-to/use-security-groups/).

### Load Balancers: ACLs

<Macro id="acls" />

Learn how to use the ACL feature in our [dedicated how-to](/network/load-balancer/how-to/create-manage-acls/) and go deeper with our [reference documentation](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/acls/).

### Other controls

For resources such as Instances and Elastic Metal servers, you may wish to implement third-party manual solutions in front of your public services to enhance security, for example:

- Deploying a reverse proxy, e.g. Nginx (TODO), and configuring it to enforce rate limits and to throttle traffic. This helps to prevent abuse and DDOS attacks on your public-facing services.
- Installing a **W**eb **A**pplication **F**irewall that can filter out malicious traffic such as requests containing attack patterns, or requests from blacklisted IPs.

## Handle traffic surges with autoscaling, caching and load balacing solutions

Autoscaling for Traffic Spikes
While not a direct DDoS mitigation strategy, setting up auto-scaling policies for your infrastructure (if the cloud provider supports it) helps ensure that your services can handle legitimate traffic surges, reducing the risk of a DDoS attack taking down your system due to resource exhaustion.

Combine this with traffic monitoring to quickly identify when a scaling event might be triggered by malicious activity.

Deploy a CDN (Content Delivery Network)
A CDN like Cloudflare, Akamai, or Fastly can help protect your public services by absorbing DDoS traffic. CDNs have global networks that can cache content, distribute traffic, and mitigate DDoS attacks at the edge before they reach your origin server. This minimizes the load on your infrastructure and prevents resource exhaustion.

P Blacklisting/Whitelisting
Manually configure firewalls or load balancers to limit access to your public services by:

Blocking known malicious IPs or IP ranges (e.g., using public threat intelligence feeds).
Whitelisting trusted IP addresses (especially for administrative interfaces or APIs) and blocking all others. This reduces your attack surface, allowing access only to known entities.
