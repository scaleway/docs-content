In the Secret Manager section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/), you can now select a [region](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#region) to display secrets and folders inside this region. Whenever you create a secret, you no longer need to specify the region, as it will be created in the region you are currently working on.

Find out more about Secret Manager in our [dedicated documentation](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/quickstart/).
