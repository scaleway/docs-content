- **New:** Ability to restrict cluster access by specifying allowed IPs in CIDR notation.  
- **Default:** `0.0.0.0/0` allows connections from all IPs.  
- **Added:** UI for adding and deleting allowed IPs via the Scaleway console.  
- **Note:** Kosmos clusters require unrestricted access from Scaleway IP subnets.  
This security enhancement reduces the risk of unauthorized access. Find more information in the [documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/containers/kubernetes/how-to/manage-allowed-ips/).
