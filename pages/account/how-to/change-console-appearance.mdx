You can choose the color scheme of the [Scaleway console](/account/concepts/#console) according to your preferences. We offer a light, dark, darker, or system-based color scheme.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

1. Access the [Profile](https://console.scaleway.com/account/profile) tab of your **User Account** page.
  Alternatively, click your Organization name on the top-right corner of the console navigation menu, then click **Profile**.
2. Scroll to the **Appearance** section and select the color scheme for your Scaleway console. You can choose from four color scheme options:
    * Light
    * Dark
    * Darker
    * System

  Your selection is saved automatically once you have chosen a color scheme.
