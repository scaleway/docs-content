This page explains how to [schedule a key deletion](/key-manager/concepts/#scheduled-deletion) using the Scaleway console. You cannot delete protected keys, i.e. keys to which you have applied [key protection](/key-manager/concepts/#key-protection).

Once you schedule a key for deletion, it enters a 7-day pending deletion period, during which you can still recover it. After this retention period, the key and its version are permanently deleted.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created](/key-manager/how-to/create-km-key/) a Key Manager key
- Disabled key protection from the key to delete

## How to delete a key

1. Click Key Manager in the **Security & Identity section** of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. Your keys display.
2. Click the key you want to delete.
3. Click on the Settings tab.
4. Scroll down to the **Delete key** section, and click **Delete key**.
5. Type **DELETE** and click **Delete key** to confirm. Your key displays in the **Scheduled for deletion** tab for a period of 7 days before being permanently deleted.

     Deleting a key is a permanent action. All data encrypted using this key, including data encryption keys, will become unusable, if you do not [recover it](/key-manager/how-to/recover-deleted-keys/) before the end of the retention period.
