When carrying out actions on Scaleway Object Storage resources via an API or CLI (eg x, y or z), the API/CLI does not provide a parameter to specify the desired [Project](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#project) for the Object Storage resources. Therefore, when you create an API key with IAM, you are prompted to specify its **preferred Project for Object Storage**. This API key will always use this Project when carrying out Object Storage actions via any API/CLI.

In this document, we explain the concept of preferred Projects for Object Storage, explain how to configure your IAM API key for this, and give some code examples for overriding the preferred Project when making an API call.

## What is a Project?

You can create multiple Projects within an Organization, to enable you to group your resources. Each Organization has at least one Project, called `default`, to which all resources you create (Instances, Kubernetes Kapsules, Object Storage buckets etc) are added if no other Projects are created. 

When you create new Projects, you can choose which Project to add resources to, or manage resources in. However, Object Storage has its own limitations which make it harder to manipulate Projects, **specifically via an API**. When carrying out actions on Scaleway Object Storage resources via the Scaleway console, the target Project can be still selected from the product dashboard or drop down menu.

## API keys

You need an API key if you want to carry out actions on Scaleway products & resources via the Scaleway [API]() or other Scaleway developer tools like the [CLI]() and [Terraform](), or any third-party API/CLI compatible with Scaleway products. An API key is not necessary if you only use the [console]() to create and manage your Scaleway resources. 

When you generate an API key with IAM, the key is associated with a specific [IAM user]() or [IAM application](). The API key inherits the permissions of its bearer (the user or application it is associated with). The user/application may have permissions on one or several Scaleway Projects, accorded to them via [policies]().

## The impact of preferred Projects

When you perform an action on Scaleway Object Storage using the S3 API, or any third-party API or CLI, there is no available parameter to specify the Project. Therefore, Object Storage actions will always be performed in a single Project - the API key's preferred Project for Object Storage. The preferred project is specified when creating the API key (or can be edited at a later date).

<Message type="important">
Setting the preferred Project does not automatically give the API key bearer permissions for Object Storage in this Project. Ensure that the user/application is either the Owner of the Organization, or has a [policy]() giving them appropriate permissions for Object Storage in this Project.
</Message>

When using the S3 CLI:
- An action of listing the buckets (`aws s3 ls`) will list the buckets of the preferred Project
- An action of creating a bucket (`aws s3 mb`) will create a new bucket inside the preferred Project
- An action of moving an object from a bucket to another (`aws s3 mv source destination`) will only work if the source bucket and the destination buckets are in the preferred pProject for an API key

Therefore, whenever you perform an action on Object Storage via the API, check that:
- You are using the correct API key to perform the call
- The API key you use has the adequate permissions on Object Storage on this Project
- The preferred Project for the API key is where you want to perform the action

## How to create an API key via the Scaleway console

To create an API key via the Scaleway console, follow the steps detailed in [how to create an API key]().

During creation, you are asked to select a preferred Project for the API key. A list of your current Projects displays. Choose the required Project for this API key.

It is also essential to make sure the API key [has Permissions to carry out Object Storage actions within this Project]() Ensure that a suitable policy is attached to the IAM user/application associated with this API key.

## How to edit the preferred Project of an API key via the Scaleway console

From the [API key list](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/api-keys), click on <Icon name="more"/> icon to the right of the API key you want to edit, and select *Edit** from the menu. A pop-up displays, and you can choose a new preferred project for Object Storage for this API key

## How to create and edit API keys via the API

API keys can also be created and edited from the Scaleway API, including the configuration of the preferred Project. See our dedicated [deveopers documentation](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/iam/api/v1alpha1/#api-keys-3665ae) for more details.

## Overriding the preferred Project when making a call

It is possible to override the API key's preferred Project when making an API call. To do this, you need the Project ID for the target Project where you want to perform the action.

When passing the API access key in the call, simply add the `@` symbol to the end of the key,followed by the target Project ID.

For example, imagine we have:
- API access key `SCW2DVV7CZHD8S68YETV`
- Target Project with an ID of `50a526f2-c070-4dca-8f51-fe611a17abb2`

Passing the API access key `SCW2DVV7CZHD8S68YETV@50a526f2-c070-4dca-8f51-fe611a17abb2` will perform actions on the targeted Project even if the preferred Project is different. You must still make sure the API key has the permissions on the targeted Project.

## Example

In the following example, we create an IAM application, create an API key for that application, and explore the effects that permissions and preferred Project has on our API calls for Object Storage.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).
  - You are the Owner of the Organization, or have a policy giving you the [IAMManager](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/) permission sets necessary to create an IAM application.
</Message>

1. [Create a new IAM application](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-application) called `my-test-app` without attaching any policies.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-iam-app.webp" alt="" />

2. [Create an API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/#how-to-create-an-api-key-for-an-iam-application) described as `Test app API key` for the `my-test-app` application. Select the preferred Project for the API key as `default`.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-api-key-test.webp" alt="" />

3. Show an example of trying to list/create buckets via the API with this API key: it doesn't work since the key has no permissions for Object Storage.

4. Attach a policy to the API key in the console giving it Object Storage permissions.

5. Repeat step 3 and show it works, and creates/lists from the default Project.

6. Create another Project in the Organization.

7. Use the override feature to show how to override the preferred Project.
