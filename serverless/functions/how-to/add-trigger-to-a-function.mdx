This page shows you how to configure triggers for your functions. Triggers are configured during function deployment, and determine how and when the function will execute.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created a functions namespace](/serverless/functions/how-to/create-a-functions-namespace/)
  - You have [created a function](/serverless/functions/how-to/create-a-function/)
  - You have [created an SQS namespace](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-namespace)
  - You have [created credentials](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-credentials) for your SQS namespace
  - You have [created an SQS queue](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-queues/)

## SQS triggers

[SQS triggers](/serverless/functions/concepts/#sqs-trigger) allow you to automatically invoke a function using events stored in a [queue](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#queue).

SQS queues of the [Scaleway Messaging and Queuing](/serverless/messaging/quickstart/) product are compatible with Serverless Functions.

The configuration of the queue retention may affect the behavior of the trigger. Refer to the [Considerations to configure event retention for trigger inputs](/serverless/functions/reference-content/configure-trigger-inputs/) page for more information.

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.
2. Click the relevant functions namespace.
3. Click the name of the function you want to manage. The function overview displays.
4. Click the **Triggers** tab. The trigger configuration displays.
5. Click **Create new Trigger**. The trigger creation form displays in a pop-up.
6. Enter a **name** for your trigger and select the **SQS (Scaleway)** type. Select the messaging namespace to use from the drop down name and select your queue name.
7. Click **Create trigger** to launch trigger creation.

## CRON triggers

[CRON triggers](/serverless/functions/concepts/#cron-trigger) allow you to invoke your functions based on a recurring schedule.

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.
2. Click the relevant functions namespace.
3. Click the name of the function you want to manage. The function overview displays.
4. Click the **Triggers** tab. The trigger configuration displays.
5. Click **Create new Trigger**. The trigger creation form displays in a pop-up.
6. Enter a **name** for your trigger and select the **CRON** type.
7. Enter the cron schedule in UNIX format (`* * * * *`) and paste your JSON arguments in the form.
8. Click **Create trigger** to launch trigger creation.
