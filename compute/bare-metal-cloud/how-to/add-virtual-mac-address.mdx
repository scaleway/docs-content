Virtual MAC addresses are virtual interface identifiers and are required for virtualization. If you run multiple virtual machines on one physical Bare Metal server, you can configure the [MAC address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address) of its virtual network interface to the virtual MAC associated with the [flexible IP](/compute/bare-metal-cloud/concepts/#flexible-ip) to ensure network connectivity of the virtual machine.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) 
- You have [configured your SSH Key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key)
- You have [created](/compute/bare-metal-cloud/how-to/create-server) and [installed](/compute/bare-metal-cloud/how-to/install-server) a Bare Metal server

</Message>

<Message type="tip">

  Virtual MAC addresses are only required for virtualization purposes. If you want to configure the flexible IP as a second interface on the host OS, no virtual MAC is required.

1. Click **Bare Metal** in the **Compute** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Bare Metal dashboard displays.

2. Click the **Flexible IPs** tab.

3. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the flexible IP that you want configure. The configuration menu of the flexible IP displays.

4. Click **More Info** to see detailed information about the IP address.

5. Scroll down to the **Mac address** section and click **Add Mac address**:

6. Choose the desired type of virtual MAC address. You can choose from `VMware`, `XEN` or `KVM`. It is recommended to choose the type corresponding to your virtualization technology. Confirm by clicking on **Generate MAC Address**.

If the virtual MAC address is no longer needed, you can remove it from the flexible IP by clicking on the **Delete** button.
