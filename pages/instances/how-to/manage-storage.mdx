- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

You can manage the storage resources attached to your Instances directly from the Scaleway console.

Storage resources consist of:

**Volumes**: Volumes are storage spaces used by your Instances. You can attach several volumes to an Instance.
**Snapshots**: Snapshots contain the data of a specific volume at a particular point in time, giving you total freedom of what you want to back up. Data may include the operating system, configuration information, and files stored in the volume.
**Images**: Images are backups of your Instances. You can use an image to restore your data or create a series of Instances with a predefined configuration.

## Managing volumes

Volumes are the primary storage solution for your Instances. Scaleway Instances support either **Local Storage** or **Block Storage** volumes depending on the Instance type.

  Are you missing a volume in the list? Refer to the [Block Storage](https://console.scaleway.com/block-storage/volumes) or [Local Storage](https://console.scaleway.com/local-storage/volumes) sections of the Scaleway console to see a full list of resources allocated to your Project.

1. Click **Instances** from the left side menu. The Instances section displays.
2. Click the name of the Instance you want to manage. The Instance overview page displays.
3. Click the **Storage** tab to display a list of all storage resources attached to the Instance.
5. Scroll to the **Volumes** section to see a list of all volumes attached to the Instance.
5. Click <Icon name="more" /> to view a list of options for the volume. Depending on the volume you can:
    * Display more information about the volume
    * [Increase the volume size](/block-storage/how-to/increase-block-volume/)
    * [Detach the volume from the Instance](/block-storage/how-to/detach-a-volume/)
    * [Create a snapshot of the volume](/instances/how-to/create-a-snapshot/)
    * [Delete the volume](/block-storage/how-to/delete-a-volume/)

### Adding a volume to the Instance

1. Click **Instances** from the left side menu. The Instances section displays.
2. Click the name of the Instance you want to manage. The Instance overview page displays.
3. Click the **Storage** tab to display a list of all storage resources attached to the Instance.
4. Click **+ Create volume** in the **Volumes** section of the page. A pop-up displays.
5. Enter a volume name and choose the volume size in GB.

    **Block Storage**: A block device is a storage volume on a network-connected storage system that is exposed to the guest operating system as if it were a physical disk. Scaleway provides Block Volumes with either 5.000 or 15.000 IOPS guaranteed.
    **Local Storage**: A fixed amount of storage located on local disks of the pyhsical hypervisor. The amount of local storage is tied to the compute resources allocated.
6. Click **Add volume** to create and attach the volume to the Instance.

    * [Copy the snapshot to an Object Storage bucket](/block-storage/how-to/create-volume-from-snapshot/)
    * [Delete the snapshot](/block-storage/how-to/delete-a-snapshot/)

### Creating a snapshot from the Instance

5. Select the volume to snapshot from the drop-down list.
6. Enter a name for the snapshot
7. Click **Create snapshot** to snapshot the volume and attach the snapshot to the Instance.

1. Click **Instances** from the left side menu. The Instances section displays.
2. Click the name of the Instance you want to manage. The Instance overview page displays.
3. Click the **Storage** tab to display a list of all storage resources attached to the Instance.
5. Scroll to the **Images** section of the page to see a list of all images attached to the Instance.
5. Click <Icon name="more" /> to view a list of options for the image. You can:
    * Display more information about the image
    * Create an Instance from the image
    * Delete the image.

### Creating an image from the Instance

1. Click **Instances** from the left side menu. The Instances section displays.
