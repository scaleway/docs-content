Domains and DNS allows you to manage and register your [internal](/network/domains-and-dns/concepts/#internal-domain) and [external domains](/network/domains-and-dns/concepts/#external-domain) and configure and manage their DNS zones. Register and (auto-)renew your domains easily! Domains and DNS provide support for queries via both IPv4 and IPv6.

  Make sure to check your domain name for any spelling issues before you place the order. 
  * You cannot change the domain name once the registration is complete and the fees will still apply. You can of course make a new registration with the correctly spelled domain name.
  * Internal domains are billed immediately upon registration.
