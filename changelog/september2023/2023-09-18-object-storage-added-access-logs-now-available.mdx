Starting today, access logs are now available in Cockpit for the Paris region! This enhancement will provide you with even greater visibility and control over your data.

Access logs are invaluable tools that record detailed information about every interaction with your objects in the Object Storage service. These logs include essential data such as who accessed your objects, when they accessed them, and from which IP address. With access logs enabled, you can gain deeper insights into how your data is being used, and enhance your security and compliance efforts.
