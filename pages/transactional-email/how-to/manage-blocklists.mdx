The Transactional Email blocklist feature allows your to manage email addresses that generate errors, or “bounces”. Emails are automatically blocked when a mailbox does not exist, or is full, to prevent sending emails to a recipient address that is not reachable.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization. For blocklists your can apply the `TransactionalEmailBlocklistFullAccess` permission
- [Configured your domain(s) with Transactional Email](/transactional-email/how-to/configure-domain-with-transactional-email/)

## How to monitor temporary blocklists

If any of your emails bounced, you will see a temporary blocklist entry, with a duration of 48 hours, containing the details of the email that bounced and the reason, or flag. Some examples of bounce reasons are:

  - `Mailbox not found` - when mailbox does not exist
  - `Mailbox full` - when the mailbox is full.

The temporary blocklist entry is created automatically to prevent repeated attempts to send emails, which could damage your reputation.

To see the blocklist:

1. Click **Transactional Email** in the **Managed Services** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. Your domains display.
2. Click the domain whose blocklist you want to manage. An overview of your domain appears.
3. Click the **Blocklist** tab. Your blocklist displays, detailing the recipient email, the flags, the date the block began, and when it ends.

<Message type="tip">
  You can [create webhooks](/transactional-email/how-to/create-webhooks) for the following blocklist events:
    - `email_blocklisted` - An email was blocked by an active blocklist.
    - `blocklist_created` - A blocklist was created for an email address. Any new emails sent by the address will be blocked.

  By setting up a blocklist webhook, you can track changes to your blocklist in real time.

## How to unblock an email address

You can unblock any address that was added to the blocklist. This is useful in cases where:

- A temporary error has been corrected. The recipient has freed up space in their mailbox, for example.
- An address becomes valid again after an update.

<Message type="note">
  You can unblock up to five addresses every 24 hours.

1. Click **Transactional Email** in the **Managed Services** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. Your domains display.
2. Click the domain whose blocklist you want to manage. An overview of your domain appears.
3. Click the **Blocklist** tab. Your blocklist displays.
4. Click **Unblock** next to the email address you wish to unblock. A pop-up appears to warn you to:

    <Message type="important">
      Make sure the issue causing the email's rejection is resolved before unblocking it to protect your reputation score and ensure optimal email deliverability.
    </Message>
5. Type **UNBLOCK** and click **Unblock** if you wish to continue.
    The email address is removed from your blocklist.
