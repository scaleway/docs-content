This page shows you how to solve domain transfer issues.

<Macro id="requirements" />

  - A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - [Created](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) an API key with sufficient [IAM permissions](/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/) to perform the actions described on this page
  - Registered a domain with Scaleway Domains and DNS

## Problem

You cannot transfer a domain.

## Possible causes

- The top level domains (TLDs) you want to transfer are not supported by Scaleway. For example, Scaleway does not support the `.lat` or `.be` TLDs. LINK TO SUPPORTED TLDs.
- Your domains may be locked at your former registrar.
- Your transfer code may be incorrect.
- Your domain's name servers may still be pointing to the former provider.
