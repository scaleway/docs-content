A Project can only be deleted once it has been emptied of its [resources](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#resource). To effectively delete your Project, you must therefore **empty its resources first**.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />
 
<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created a Project](/console/my-project/how-to/create-a-project) other than the [default Project](/console/my-project/concepts/#default-project)
  - The Project you want to delete has been emptied of its resources.
</Message>

1. Click **Project Dashboard** in the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. 
2. Click the **Settings** tab.
3. Scroll down to find the **Delete Project** section.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-delete-project.webp" alt="" />
4. Click **Delete Project**. A pop-up appears requesting you to confirm that you want to delete the selected Project.
