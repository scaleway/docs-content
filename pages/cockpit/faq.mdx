## Overview

### What is Cockpit?
Cockpit is a monitoring and alerting solution natively integrated with Scaleway's ecosystem. Cockpit allows you to collect, store, and analyze metrics, logs, and traces from your infrastructure and applications, giving you insights into your system's performance and behavior.

Cockpits are scoped per [Project](/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project) and are automatically activated when you are using [Scaleway resources that are integrated into Cockpit](/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-product-integration).

## Specifications

### What is the difference between Scaleway and custom data?
[Scaleway data](#scaleway-data) is collected automatically from Scaleway products, while [custom data](#custom-data) is manually pushed from your own sources.

#### Scaleway data
Scaleway data is the observability data (metrics and/or logs) that is natively collected by all [Scaleway products integrated with Cockpit](/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-product-integration).

#### Custom data
Custom data refers to any metrics, logs, or traces that you manually push to Cockpit. This can include data from applications hosted at Scaleway or any other platform.

### Where does Cockpit store data?

#### Scaleway data
Cockpit stores Scaleway data in the same region as the Scaleway resource that produces it:

- Metrics and logs collected from a Scaleway resource are stored in that region's data source as **Scaleway Metrics** or **Scaleway Logs**.
- You cannot configure a different region for where this automatically collected data is stored.

#### Custom data
In order for Cockpit to store your custom data, you must first [create a custom data source](/cockpit/how-to/create-external-data-sources/) in a region of your choice. The data you send will then be stored in that custom data source's region and not replicated across other regions.

Even though data is region-bound, your Cockpit Grafana instance can query and visualize data across all regions where you have data sources.

If you are using Scaleway's preconfigured dashboards in Grafana, make sure you have selected the region of the resource you want to monitor using the drop-down at the top of the dashboard. This filters the dashboards to only show data from the matching regional data source.

## Pricing and billing

### How am I billed for using Cockpit and its features?

## Usage and management

### How do I send my own data to my Cockpit?
If you have set up an agent, you can send your data using our [dedicated documentation](/cockpit/how-to/send-metrics-logs-to-cockpit/).

If you have not set up an agent, check out our [documentation](/cockpit/how-to/send-metrics-with-grafana-alloy/) to find out how to
configure the Grafana Alloy agent, push your data, and visualize it in Grafana.

<Message type="important">
Sending metrics and logs using an external path is a billable feature. Any data that you push yourself is considered as "custom" and is billed, even if you collect that data from Scaleway products. Refer to the [product pricing](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/managed-services/#cockpit) for more information.
