## Problem

My container is in an error state.

## Cause

There are several factors that can put Serverless Containers in an error state:

- Your container image does not work properly
- Your container image does not contain a webserver
- Your deployment exceeds the [Serverless Containers limitations](/serverless-containers/reference-content/containers-limitations/)

## Possible solutions

- Try to build and run your image locally using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/).

- Make sure your image embarks a webserver (nginx, Apache, Alpine, etc.) that can process HTTP requests.

- Make sure you specified the correct platform when building your image locally using the `--platofrm linux/amd64` argument, as Serverless Containers do not handle images built for `arm64` platforms.

- Make sure your deployment does not exceed the [Serverless Containers limitations](/serverless-containers/reference-content/containers-limitations/).

## Going further

Refer to the following troubleshooting pages for other solutions:
