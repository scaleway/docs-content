## Configuration Restrictions

In order to ensure the proper functioning of the product, we restrict the use of certain ports and environment variables

* Blocked Port:
  * **25**: Due to potential abuse (SPAM), no outbound traffic is allowed through this port

* Reserved environment variables:
  * `PORT`: Port on which your server should listen to: `8080`
  * `SCW_*`: Reserved for product configuration (for example: token validation)

## Image configuration

We use [Knative](https://knative.dev/) on Scaleway Kaspule to deliver the CaaS Product. Hence, if you use your image on a knative service it should work.

* **Web Server**: Your container needs to include a web server (otherwise CaaS will not be able to wake it up).
* **Execution**: A container can run up to 15 min after receiving its last request.
* **Port**: Your application should listen on either the environment variable `$PORT` (reserved) or on port `8080`.
* **Inbound traffic**: Only HTTP (1 or 2) inbound traffic is allowed.
* **Token and access management**: You can configure a token through the Scaleway Console or API. Our API will set the following environment variables, which you need to use in your application to validate incoming requests (token provided by our APIs):
  * `SCW_PUBLIC`: `true` or `false` based on your privacy settings.
  * `SCW_PUBLIC_KEY`: PEM-encoded public Key used to decrypt tokens.
  * `SCW_NAMESPACE_ID`: Current Namespace ID
  * `SCW_APPLICATION_ID`: Current Container ID
