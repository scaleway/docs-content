Scaleway Managed Databases allows you to run your Database Instances without setting up or managing infrastructure. Scaleway is responsible for implementing and maintaining features that improve the performance, scalability, security and high-availability of your Database Instances.

If you have a self-managed database instance, or you use a different cloud provider, you can easily migrate your databases to Scaleway.

Different factors, such as the size of your databases and your application use-case, can determine the best migration method. Below is a list of the different migration methods and their benefits, as well as a link to each of the tutorials that show you how to carry out your method of choice.

| Database size | Downtime tolerance | Engine | Recommended migration method | Benefits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| < 100GB | Can afford downtime | PostgreSQL | [Dump/restore from local machine](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/api-cli/import-data-to-managed-postgresql-databases/#using-pgadmin) | Easy, straightforward |
| > 100GB | Can afford downtime | MySQL and PostgreSQL | [Dump/restore from a Scaleway Instance](/tutorials/migrate-databases-instance/) | Avoids local storage and bandwidth bottlenecks |
| Any size | Cannot afford downtime | PostgreSQL | [Set up logical replication](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/api-cli/logical-replication-as-subscriber/)  | Zero downtime, real-time data sync, flexible migration windows, easy rollback. Refer to the official PostgreSQL documentation for a list of [logical replication restrictions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/logical-replication-restrictions.html) |
