If your server encounters issues but does not have a hardware failure, you can still recover your data using rescue mode, regardless of whether you are using Windows or Linux.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- A [created](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/order-a-server/) and [installed](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/install-a-server/) dedicated server

## Booting into rescue mode

1. Follow [these instructions](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/use-rescue-mode/) to start your server in rescue mode (emergency system) via the Dedibox console.
2. Log into your server using one of the following methods:
   - [PuTTY](http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe) on [Windows](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/connect-to-server/#from-windows)
   - `ssh` from a terminal on [Linux or macOS](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/connect-to-server/#from-osx-(mac)-and-linux).

   <Message type="tip">
     The rescue mode credentials (username and password) are displayed in your Dedibox console.
   </Message>

## Gaining root access

By default, you are logged in as a regular user in rescue mode and may not have permission to execute all necessary commands.

1. Switch to the `root` account by typing the following command and pressing Enter:
    ```bash
    sudo su
    ```
2. Enter the rescue user password displayed in the Dedibox console and press Enter.
   
   <Message type="tip">
     For security reasons, the password won’t be visible when typing.
   </Message>

## Mounting partitions

To access your data, you need to mount your server’s partitions in rescue mode. If this step succeeds, you can likely recover your files.

1. As the `root` user, run the following command to mount all partitions:
    ```bash
    mountall.sh
    ```
   The partitions will be mounted in the `/mnt` directory.

   <Message type="note">
     You may encounter errors like `swap cannot be mounted` or `many partitions do not exist`. These can be safely ignored.
   </Message> 

## Recovering your data

You can recover your data by either transferring it to the [Dedibackup](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/storage/) storage space or downloading it directly to your local computer via SFTP.

<Message type="important">
  Exercise caution when editing your data in rescue mode. The `root` user has full permissions, including the ability to irreversibly delete files.
</Message>

### Recovering data using Dedibackup

To back up all disk contents (including partitions) to your Dedibackup storage:

1. Install an FTP client and `screen` using the following command:
    ```bash
    apt -y install screen lftp
    ```
2. Start `screen`:
    ```bash
    screen
    ```
3. Transfer your data with this command:
    ```bash
    lftp -u YOUR_DEDIBACKUP_LOGIN,YOUR_DEDIBACKUP_PASSWORD dedibackup.online.net -e "mirror --reverse /mnt /; exit"
    ```
    <Message type="note">
      Replace `YOUR_DEDIBACKUP_LOGIN` with your Dedibackup login (e.g., `sd-XXXX`) and `YOUR_DEDIBACKUP_PASSWORD` with your Dedibackup password.
    </Message>

   <Message type="tip">
     If you’ve forgotten the password, reset it in the console to generate a new one.
   </Message>

You can now access your files via any FTP client connected to Dedibackup.

<Message type="tip">
  Dedibackup is limited to 1000 files per volume. Consider using archives when backing up data.
</Message>

### Backing up data to your personal computer (via SFTP)

You can use an SFTP client like [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) to download data from your server.

1. Open FileZilla and fill in the following details:
    - **Host**: Your server’s IP address
    - **Username**: Rescue mode username (e.g., `sd-XXXX`)
    - **Password**: Rescue mode password
    - **Port**: 22
   
   <Message type="tip">
     These details are available in your console once rescue mode is active.
   </Message>

#### Example configuration

<Lightbox src="sftp.webp" />

Your data will be located in the `/mnt`, `/sda1`, or `/sda` directories. You can download it before reinstalling the server or transferring data to another server.
