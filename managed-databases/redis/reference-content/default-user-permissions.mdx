When you create a Redis™ Database Instance, you have to specify a user. It will be created with the following permissions:

```
+client +cluster
info +cluster
nodes +cluster
myid +cluster
slots +cluster
shards allkeys
```

<Message type="important">
  The default permissions cannot be edited. It is also not possible to create additional users.
</Message>

You can specify a name for this user when you create a Database Instance via the Scaleway API or the CLI.

This allows you to ensure the username is compatible with different software integrations where specific usernames are not supported.

For a username to be valid, it must:
  - contain only letters, numbers, hyphens, dollars and underscores
  - be between 1 and 63 characters long
  - not start with `_rkv`
  - start with a letter
  - not be `scalewayadmin` or `metrics`

<Message type="important">
  You can change the default username and password anytime via the Scaleway API or the CLI. Refer to the [Managing the default user's username and password](/managed-databases/redis/api-cli/configuring-user-permissions) documentation page for more information.
