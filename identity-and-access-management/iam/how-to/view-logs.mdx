<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).
</Message>

1. Click **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** from the top-right of your [Organization Dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) in the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-iam-users-dashboard.webp" alt="" />
2. Click the **Logs** tab.
    A list of the latest actions performed on resources in your Organization appears. You can filter them by date, action, category and by the ID of the IAM principal who performed the action. You can sort them by date.

    <Message type="important">
    Some of the principals who performed the actions might appear as `Unknown` in the logs. This could be due to a couple of reasons: <br />
    - The principal used to be a part of the Organization, but since performing the action is no longer a part of it. For example, if a user or an application is removed from an Organization, their name will no longer appear in the list, but the user or application ID still indicates it was them who performed the action.
    - You do not have the IAM permissions necessary to see the details of a principal.
    <br />

    Besides `unknown`, you might also see principals named `Scaleway`. This happens when an action is performed by Scaleway. For example, whenever a new Organization is created 3 groups are created by default. This action is technically performed by Scaleway, and will be described as such in the logs.<br /><br />
    When a user accepts an invitation to an Organization, Scaleway will add this user to the Organization, so this action appears as having been performed by `Scaleway`.

3. Click <Icon name="seeMore" />. A pop-up appears to display the user agent and IP address information.
