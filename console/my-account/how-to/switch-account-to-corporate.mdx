Scaleway offers two profile types: Personal and Corporate. All users are given the possibility to select one or the other option when first signing up for a Scaleway account. If you signed up for a personal account and need to convert to a corporate one, follow these instructions.


<Message type="important">
 Switching to a corporate account is permanent. You will not be able to switch back to a personal account once the conversion to corporate is completed.
