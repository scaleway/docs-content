**S**erver-**S**ide **E**ncryption with **C**ustomer-provided keys (SSE-C) is an encryption method provided by Scaleway Object Storage to protect your data at rest. It allows you to supply your own encryption keys to encrypt data when it is uploaded, and to decrypt data when it is accessed.

<Message type="note">
Currently, Scaleway does not support other types of server-side encryption methods, such as SSE-KMS, or SSE-S3.

## SSE-C overview

Managing SSE-C using the `aws s3api` command set requires 3 elements:
- A 256-bit (32-byte) base64-encoded key
- The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key, according to the [RFC 1321](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1321) norm.
- The encryption algorithm used to encrypt/decrypt your data. It must be `AES256`.

The encryption key and its digest are sent alongside the data to the cloud storage service. The data is then encrypted using the key provided during the write operation.
Once the data has been copied, the encryption key is deleted. The digest of the key is saved with the object's metadata, allowing the data to be decrypted when downloaded.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)
- installed and initialized the [AWS CLI](/storage/object/api-cli/object-storage-aws-cli/)

## How to generate an encryption key and its digest

SSE-C requires a 256-bit (32-byte) base64-encoded key, and its MD5 digest. If you already have a compatible encryption key and digest, you can skip directly to the [next section](#how-to-upload-and-download-objects-with-sse-c).

1. In a terminal, run the following command to generate a random base64-encoded 32-byte key, and export it as an environment variable:

    ```sh
    export ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
    ```

2. Run the following command to generate the base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of your encryption key, and export it as an environment variable:

    ```sh
    export KEY_DIGEST=$(echo -n $KEY | openssl dgst -md5 -binary | base64)
    ```

3. Store your encryption key and its digest in a safe place.

<Message type="important">
If you lose the encryption key, you also lose the data encrypted with it, as you will not be able to perform `GET` operation on encrypted objects without the corresponding key.

## How to upload and download objects with SSE-C

1. Run the command below to upload an object and encrypt it. Make sure to replace `<your-bucket-name>`, `<your-object-key>`, and `<path/to/your/file>` with the correct values. 

    ```sh
    aws s3api put-object \
    --bucket <your-bucket-name> \
    --key <your-object-key> \
    --body <path/to/your/file> \
    --sse-customer-algorithm AES256 \
    --sse-customer-key $ENCRYPTION_KEY \
    --sse-customer-key-md5 $KEY_DIGEST
    ```

    <Message type="note">
    The `--sse-customer-algorithm` argument is required, and only accepts `AES256` as a value.
    </Message>

2. (Optional) Run the command below to check that you **cannot** download your object without the encryption key and its digest. Make sure to replace `<your-bucket-name>`, `<your-object-key>`, and `<path/to/destination/file>` with the correct values.

    ```sh
    aws s3api put-object \
    --bucket <your-bucket-name> \
    --key <your-object-key> \
    <path/to/your/file> \
    ```
    An error message similar to the following should display:
    ```
    An error occurred (400) when calling the HeadObject operation: Bad Request
    ```

3. Run the command below to download the previously uploaded object and decrypt it. Make sure to replace `<your-bucket-name>`, `<your-object-key>`, and `<path/to/destination/file>` with the correct values. 

    ```sh
    aws s3api put-object \
    --bucket <your-bucket-name> \
    --key <your-object-key> \
    <path/to/destination/file> \
    --sse-customer-algorithm AES256 \
    --sse-customer-key $ENCRYPTION_KEY \
    --sse-customer-key-md5 $KEY_DIGEST
    ```

    Your object is now located at the specified destination.

    <Message type="note">
    You can store your keys in files and pass them as arguments using the format below:
    ```sh
    --sse-customer-key file://path/to/file \
    --sse-customer-key-md5 file://path/to/file
    ```
