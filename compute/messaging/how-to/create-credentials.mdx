This page shows how to create [credentials](/compute/messaging/concepts#namespace) for a [Messaging namespace](/compute/messaging/concepts#namespace). Credentials give their bearer (e.g. services and platforms) access to your namespace. The process of creating credentials differs depending on the namespace type ([NATS](/compute/messaging/concepts#nats) or [SQS/SNS](/compute/messaging/concepts#sqssns)).

You can create multiple sets of credentials for each namespace.

  - You have [created a Messaging namespace](/compute/messaging/how-to/create-namespace/)
</Message>

## How to create credentials for a NATS namespace

Credentials for NATS namespaces are not granular: they necessarily give full read and write access to the namespace. The bearer of these credentials can publish and receive messages, as well as manage topics and streams.

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The list of your Messaging namespaces displays.
2. Click the NATS namespace you wish to create credentials for. The namespace's **Overview** page displays.
3. In the **Credentials** panel, click **Generate credentials**. A pop-up displays.

4. Enter a name for these credentials, and click **Generate credentials**.

    The credentials are created and a button displays prompting you to to download them in a `.creds` file.

    <Message type="important">
      This is your only chance to download these credentials.
    </Message>
5. Click **Download** and save the file, before closing the window.

    You are returned to your namespace's overview page. The name of your newly-generated credentials and their access level is displayed in the **Credentials** tab.

## How to create credentials for an SQS/SNS namespace

Credentials for SQS/SNS namespaces are granular: you can define the level of access that they should give.

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The list of your Messaging namespaces displays.
2. Click the SQS/SNS namespace you wish to create credentials for. The namespace's **Overview** page displays.
3. In the **Credentials** panel, click **Generate credentials**. A pop-up displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-sqssns-credentials.webp" alt="" />
4. Enter a name for these credentials.
5. Select the required permissions for the credentials. You must choose at least one of **Write**, **Read** and **Manage**. You are free to select any combination of these permissions. 
6. Click **Generate credentials**.

    The credentials are created. The access key and secret key are displayed, and you are invited to copy them.

    <Message type="important">
      This is your only chance to view and save the secret key. Make sure that you copy it and save it somewhere securely.
    </Message>
5. Copy and save the credentials, before closing the window.

    You are returned to your namespace's overview page. The name of your newly-generated credentials, along with the access key and access level are displayed in the **Credentials** tab.
