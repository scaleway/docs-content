Once you have a Dedibox server, have installed an OS and connected via SSH you're ready to get started using it! This document gives you some tips and hints about the basics.

## How to use the shell

By default, there is no graphical desktop available on a server. Instead you run all commands in text mode in a shell/terminal. The shell is very powerful. It allows you to carry out a huge range of actions, including installing, configuring and using software, creating, editing and deleting files and folders, and configuring your machine. You can [connect to the shell via SSH](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/connect-to-server/#how-to-connect-via-ssh)

The most basic commands required for using your server via the shell can be found in our [basic Linux commands](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/reference-content/basic-linux-commands/) tutorial.

## How to use a graphical desktop

If you prefer a graphical desktop on your Dedibox, you can install one of our [Desktop orientated distributions](https://documentation.online.net/en/dedicated-server/operating-system/start) and connect to the server using the [X2Go Client.](https://documentation.online.net/en/dedicated-server/tutorials/administration/x2go). See also our documentation for [connecting via Windows Remote Desktop](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/connect-to-server/#how-to-connect-via-remote-desktop)

## How to install software (Linux OSes)

After you create and install your Dedibox, only an SSH server and an operating system are installed on the server. A package manager will help you to install and manage software on your server. There are several package managers available, depending on your distribution.

  - On Debian/Ubuntu, the package manager is called [APT]. See our documentation on getting started with the APT package manager [here](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/manage-packages/).
  - On CentOS/RedHat, the package manager is called YUM.
  - On SuSE Linux, the package manager is called YAST.

You can use package managers to install, update and delete software directly from the shell.

You may wish to refer to some of our tutorials about installing various software stacks for some common use cases:

  - [Installing an FTP server](https://documentation.online.net/en/dedicated-server/tutorials/service/install-configure-proftpd)
  - [Installing a Webmin server](https://documentation.online.net/en/dedicated-server/tutorials/service/install-configure-webmin)

## How to back up your Dedibox 

You are responsible for the data on your server. Therefore, we recommend that you make regular backups. Each Dedibox can order a [Dedibackup](https://documentation.online.net/en/dedicated-server/tutorials/backup/dedibackup) option, with different disk sizes. Dedibackup gives you secure FTP storage where you can keep you backups. You can also automatize your backups, with something like [Backup Manager](https://documentation.online.net/en/dedicated-server/tutorials/backup/configure-backup/start).
