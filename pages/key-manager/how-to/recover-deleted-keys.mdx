This page shows you how to recover keys scheduled for deletion using the Scaleway [console](https://console.scaleway.com). Once you schedule a key for deletion, it enters a 7-day pending deletion period, during which you can still recover it.
After this retention period, the key and its version are permanently deleted.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created a [key](/key-manager/how-to/create-km-key/)
- Scheduled keys for deletion
