Kubernetes Kapsule clusters have quotas on the space they can occupy on an etcd database. See Kapsule [cluster-types](https://api.scaleway.com/k8s/v1/regions/fr-par/cluster-types) for details on each offer.
You can see your current cluster space consumption at any time in your cluster grafana dashboard (`Etcd disk usage` panel).
This guide helps you to free up space on your database to avoid reaching this limit.

* Looking for unused resources is a good approach, delete any Secrets, large ConfigMaps that are not used anymore in your cluster.

  ```sh
  > kubectl -n $namespace delete $ConfigMapName
  ```

* keep an eye on Helm Charts that are deploying a lot of custom resources (CRDs), they tend to fill up etcd space. You can find them by showing resource kinds

  ```sh
  > kubectl api-resources
  NAME                                SHORTNAMES                          APIVERSION                           NAMESPACED   KIND
  configmaps                          cm                                  v1                                   true         ConfigMap
  endpoints                           ep                                  v1                                   true         Endpoints
  events                              ev                                  v1                                   true         Event
  cronjobs                            cj                                  batch/v1                             true         CronJob
  jobs                                                                    batch/v1                             true         Job
  [...]
  ```
Look for resources with an external apiversion (not _v1_, _apps/v1_, _storage.k8s.io/v1_ or _batch/v1_ for example).

<Message type="note">
    It is known that cluster with many nodes and with at least one GPU node may have a lot of _nodefeatures_ objects polluting their etcd space. We are working on a long-term fix but for now manually deleting these objects and downsizing the cluster (or upgrading to a dedicated offer with a bigger etcd quota) is the best solution.

* If you have a doubt on space taken by a resource, you can dump it to get its size

  ```sh
  > kubectl get nodefeature -n kube-system   $node-feature-name -o yaml | wc -c
    305545 // ~300KiB, big object
  ```
