Once your external domains have been created and validated, you can manage them from the Scaleway console.

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have [linked your domain](/network/domains-and-dns/how-to/add-external-domain/) with Scaleway DNS
</Message>

1. Click **Domains and DNS** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Domains and DNS dashboard displays.
2. Click the **External domains** tab, then click <Icon name="more" />.

The **Domain Information** page displays. This gives you an overview of the status of your domain, as well as a list of all name servers associated with it. At the bottom of the page you also have the option of deleting your domain from Scaleway Domains and DNS.
