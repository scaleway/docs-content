Scaleway Apple silicon as-a-Service uses Apple Mac mini hardware. These devices rely on the power of Apple's silicon technology, ensuring exceptional performance and groundbreaking energy efficiency.

Apple silicon as-a-Service is tailored for developing, building, testing, and signing applications for Apple devices such as iPhones, iPads, Mac computers and more. The Mac mini boasts a sophisticated neural engine that significantly enhances machine learning capabilities.

## Requirements

- Be the [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) of the Organization in which the actions will be performed, or an IAM user with the [necessary permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission)
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)

  - Due to license constraints, the minimum lease for Apple silicon is 24 hours. As a result, the earliest you can delete a Mac mini is 24 hours after the start of its lease.
  - There is a limit of one Mac mini allowed per Organization per Availability Zone. For more information about available quotas, refer to our [documentation on Organization quotas](/console/account/reference-content/organization-quotas/#apple-silicon).

## How to connect to your Mac mini

### How to connect via VNC

VNC is a remote desktop-sharing protocol. It allows you to visualize the graphical screen output of a remote computer and transfer local keyboard and mouse events to the remote computer using a network connection.

1. Click **Apple silicon** in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu. A list of your Mac minis displays.
2. Click the Mac mini you want to connect to. Your Mac mini **Overview** displays.
3. Click the **VNC** button to launch a VNC session on your Mac mini.

    Your VNC client opens, and you can log in the graphical environment of macOS using the default user and your password.

    <Message type="note">
      macOS may ask you for your password once logged into the VNC session. Change the keyboard layout of macOS to your computer's local keyboard layout before entering the password. Click on U.S. keyboard in the top right corner to display a list of all available keyboard layouts.
