Managed Database for Redis™ is a low-latency caching solution based on in-memory data storage. It allows you to easily set up a secure cache and lighten the load on your main database.

## How to create a Redis™ Database Instance

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
</Message>

1. Click **Redis™** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. If you do not have a Database Instance already created, the creation page displays.
2. Click **Create Redis™ Database Instance**. The creation wizard displays.
3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Choose an Availability Zone. This is the geographical location where your database will be deployed.

    <Message type="note">
      Managed Database for Redis™ are available in PAR1, PAR2, AMS1 and WAW1.
    </Message>

    - Select the version of Redis™ you wish to use on your Instance. 
    - Select a database configuration. You can choose between:
        - **Cluster mode**: creates the Database as a Cluster composed of three or more nodes. The cluster uses partitioning to split the keyspace. Each partition is replicated and can be reassigned or elected as the primary when necessary.
        - **Standalone**: creates a standalone database provisioned on a single node.
    - Select a node type.
4. Configure your Network. You can select either:
    - **Private Network**: allows your Databases to communicate in an isolated and secure network without the need for a public IP address. If you select this option you must: 1. select a Private Network to attach from the drop-down and 2. enter an IP address for each node in your Private Network. The IP addresses must belong to the same subnet. The mask you select applies to all IP addresses.

    <Message type="important">
    If you want to use Private Networks you must:
    - select the option upon creation
    - have an existing Private Network to select the option

    It is not possible to add the Redis™ Database Instance to a Private Network once it has been created.

    </Message>

    <Message type="note">
    While it is theoretically possible to use any IP range within your Private Network, it is not recommended to use any IP subnets that are publicly routed. Whilst the configuration may work for your Instances to communicate with each other, you might experience connectivity issues to machines on the public Internet within these ranges. 

    It is therefore recommended that you configure your Private Network using IPs from the following private IP ranges: 
    - `192.168.0.1` - `192.168.255.254` (65,536 IP addresses) and
    - `172.16.0.1` - `172.31.255.254` (1,048,576 IP addresses)   

    You can use any [subnet mask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork) allowed by these ranges. All interfaces in the same Private Network must be configured with the same subnet mask. If you are not sure, use `/24` for your Private Network. 
    Using the `10.0.0.0/8` private IP range is **not recommended**, as this block is used for infrastructure services. This is only recommended for expert users. 

    <Message type="important">
    - It is not possible to use a broadcast address (last address of the subnet, e.g. `192.168.0.255/24`) or network address (first address of the subnet, e.g. `192.168.0.0/24`).
    - It is also not possible to use the same IP twice in a Private Network.

    </Message>

    - **Public Network**: resources in a public network are publicly visible by default. The default Access Control List (ACL)
    settings allow anybody to connect to resources in your network. You can restrict access by configuring ACLs.
5. Complete the remaining steps in the creation wizard:
    - Create credentials: add a name and set a password for your user.
    <Message type="important">
      Your username must adhere to specific criteria.
      - Length must be between 1 and 63 characters
      - First character must be an alphabetic character (**a-Za-Z**)
      - It can not start with **_rdb** 
      - Only **a-zA-Z0-9_$-** characters are accepted
    </Message>
    - Enter a name and optional tags for the Database.
6. Click **Create Redis™ Database Instance** to confirm your choices and launch creation.

## How to delete a Redis™ Database Instance

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have a [Redis™ Database Instance](/managed-databases/redis/how-to/create-a-database-for-redis)
</Message>

1. Click **Redis™** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the database information page.
3. Scroll down the page to the **Delete Database Instance** section and click **Delete Database Instance**. A pop-up appears to inform that:
    <Message type="important">
      This will permanently destroy your Instance and all your data will be lost. This action is irreversible.
    </Message>
4. Type **DELETE** to confirm and click **Delete Database Instance**.
    <Message type="tip">
      Alternatively, you can delete your Database from your Database Instances list by clicking <Icon name="more" /> next to the Database name and then **Delete**.
