[Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/) fully encrypted, open source video conferencing tool that does not require subscription or the need to create an account. 

The tool provides features like:

- screen sharing
- presentations
- inviting users to a conference through a custom URL
- editing documents together using Etherpad
- integrated chat

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your SSH key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
  - You have a [Scaleway Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) running Debian Buster (for better performance, we recommend that you use an instance with **at least 4 GB of RAM** - DEV1-M or larger)
  - You have a domain or subdomain pointed to your Instance

  This tutorial shows the installation of Jitsi Meet on Debian Buster. If you prefer the installation of Jitsi Meet on Ubuntu Bionic Beaver, follow [this tutorial](/tutorials/jitsi-ubuntu-bionic).

### Installing Jitsi Meet

1. Configure the hostname of the server corresponding to your domain or subdomain.

  ```
  hostnamectl set-hostname jitsi
  sed -i 's/^127.0.1.1.*$/127.0.1.1 jitsi.mydomain.tld jitsi/g' /etc/hosts
  sed -i 's/^127.0.0.1.*$/127.0.0.1 localhost jitsi.mydomain.tld jitsi/g' /etc/hosts
  ```

2. Update the apt packet cache and upgrade the software installed on the instance to the latest version available on the Debian repositories.

  ```
  apt update && apt upgrade
  ```

3. Install an [Nginx](https://nginx.org) web server. The Jitsi installation tool handles the Nginx configuration if it is present on the system.

  ```
  apt install -y nginx
  systemctl start nginx.service
  systemctl enable nginx.service
  ```

  <Message type="important">

    If Nginx or Apache are not installed, Jitsi Meet will automatically install [Jetty](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) during the installation.

  </Message>

4. Download the APT key and set up the repositories of Jitsi:

  ```
  wget -qO - https://download.jitsi.org/jitsi-key.gpg.key | apt-key add -
  sh -c "echo 'deb https://download.jitsi.org stable/' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jitsi-stable.list"
  apt update
  ```

5. Launch the installation of Jitsi Meet.

  ```
  apt install -y jitsi-meet
  ```

  When asked, enter:

    - The FQDN of your instance. For example `jitsi.mydomain.tld` and press Enter.
    - When asked about the SSL certificate choose the `Generate a new self-signed certificate (You will later get a chance to obtain a Let's Encrypt certificate)` option and press Enter.

6. Run the following script to generate a [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) SSL certificate for your instance:

  ```
  /usr/share/jitsi-meet/scripts/install-letsencrypt-cert.sh
  ```

  <Message type="tip">

    If the generation of the Let's Encrypt certificate fails, run the following command: `dpkg-reconfigure jitsi-meet-web-config` to reconfigure the package `jitsi-meet-web-config` before relaunching the certificate request.

7. Open a Web-browser and type the FQDN of your instance, for example: `https://jitsi.mydomain.tld`. The following screen displays:
