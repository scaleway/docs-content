Scaleway applies reasonable and gradual sending strategies to preserve the reputation of your domain and increase the deliverability of your emails. These measures prevent your domain from being considered a spam sender.

In order to protect the reputation of your domain and our Transactional Email service, while effectively controlling the deliverability rate of your emails, Scaleway applies traffic management measures. This reduces the risk of your domain being blacklisted in the event of [reputation](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#ip-reputation) problems.

These measures can apply if:

- your sending domain was recently purchased
- you send a large number of emails in a short period of time
- your recipient list contains a large number of incorrect or inactive email addresses
- the content of your emails is considered unwanted or unsolicited, by the recipients

Scaleway reasonably manages email traffic to make sure that your emails are delivered to recipients and that your domain maintains a good reputation as a legitimate and solicited email sender.

You can [read our anti-spam policy](https://tem.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/antispam_policy.pdf/) for more information.
