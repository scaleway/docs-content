## Job run is in an error state

### Possible solutions

- Make sure you built your image for an `amd64` architecture, as `arm64` is not supported. See [Architecture](/serverless/jobs/reference-content/jobs-limitations/#Architecture) documentation.

- Make sure your deployment does not exceed the limitations of [Serverless Jobs](/serverless/jobs/reference-content/jobs-limitations/).
