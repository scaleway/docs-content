Scaleway GPU Instances feature dedicated high-end Nvidia GPUs, making them optimal for tasks such as data processing, artificial intelligence, rendering, and video encoding.

Once you've created your GPU Instance, [connecting to it via SSH](/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/) allows you to use our [pre-configured Docker images](/gpu/how-to/use-gpu-with-docker/), providing instant access to a [preinstalled environment](/gpu/how-to/use-preinstalled-env/) with your preferred AI libraries and tools already set up.

Moreover, GPU Instances offer all the functionalities of our standard Instances, including [flexible IPs](/instances/how-to/use-flexips/), [Security Groups](/instances/how-to/use-security-groups/), [Private Networks](/instances/how-to/use-private-networks/), backups, and more.

When you have completed your calculations using the GPU Instance, [deletion can be done through the Scaleway console](/instances/how-to/delete-instance/), API, or our CLI tools.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/) added to your account

## How to create a GPU Instance

1. Navigate to **CPU & GPU Instances** under the **Compute** section in the side menu of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/). This action will direct you to the [Instance dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers).
2. Click **+ Create Instance** to proceed to the [Instance creation page](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers).
3. Select the desired GPU Instance type and choose and its Availability Zone in the pop-up. Click **Configure Instance** to continue.
      <Message type="tip">
        You can use the filter to find the GPU Instance type that suits best your requirements. Refer to our guide on [choosing the right GPU Instance type](/gpu/reference-content/choosing-gpu-instance-type/) for more information.
      </Message>
4. Follow these steps to configure your GPU Instance:
    - **Instance name and tags**: Assign a name to your Instance for easy identification. You can also add tags to organize your Instances efficiently.
    - **Image**: Pick a GPU OS image suitable for your GPU Instance. For example, select **Ubuntu Noble GPU OS 13 (Nvidia)**, which comes with preinstalled NVIDIA drivers and an NVIDIA Docker environment. You can customize your working environment using Docker with our provided Docker images or your own containers.
    - **Volumes**: Optionally, add storage volumes for your Instance. You can adjust settings such as Block and Local Storage volumes according to your requirements.
        <Message type="note">
          * The recommended minimum volume size for GPU OS images is 125 GB.
          * If your GPU Instance supports scratch storage, the scratch volume displays but can not be edited. [Learn more about scratch storage.](/gpu/how-to/use-scratch-storage-h100-instances/)
        </Message>
    - **Network configuration**: You can allocate routed IPv4 and IPv6 addresses as needed, with a maximum of 5 IPs per Instance.
    - **Cloud-init**: Configure `cloud-init` settings if required, or leave them at default values.
      <Message type="tip">
        Cloud-init scripts are the standard way to automate Instance setup, such as setting up software, users, and system configurations at the first boot. [Learn more](/instances/how-to/use-cloud-init/).
      </Message>
    - **SSH keys**: Verify the SSH keys that will grant you access to your Instance.
    - Click **Review** to view a summary of your Instance configuration and estimated costs.

5. Once you have verified the configuration of your GPU Instance, click on **Create Instance** to initiate the creation process. You will receive a notification once the GPU Instance is ready for use.

## How to connect to a GPU Instance

See our documentation on [how to connect to your Instance via SSH](/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).

Once you have connected via SSH, you can [launch a Docker container](/gpu/how-to/use-gpu-with-docker/) to start working on your AI projects.
