[dhcpcd](https://roy.marples.name/projects/dhcpcd/) is an open-source DHCP client, supporting both IPv4, and IPv6. The feature-rich software can be used to configure and automate network-related parameters of your computer using the [DHCP protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol).

In this tutorial, you will learn how to configure your IPv6 subnet with DHCPCD on Debian 10 on a Scaleway Dedibox dedicated server.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net)
  - You have a [Dedibox&reg; dedicated server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox) running on Debian 10. 
  - You have root access to the server
</Message>


## Installing DHCPCD

1. Change into the root account of your server by using `su` and the password of the `root` user.
2. Update the `apt` package manager repositories, then upgrade the software already installed on the machine to the latest version available in the repositories: 
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
3. Install DHCPCD using the `apt` package manager:
    ```
    apt install dhcpcd5
    ```

## Configuring DHCPCD


<Message type="note">
  We assume you have already generated an [IPv6 prefix and its associated DUID](/dedibox-network/ipv6/how-to/request-prefix/).
</Message> 

1. Configure your network interface. The configuration is located in a file named `/etc/network/interfaces`. Open the file in a text editor, e.g. `nano`, and edit it as follows:
    ```
    auto lo
    iface lo inet loopback

    auto eth0
    iface eth0
        use dhcp
        # An address in the IPv6 block provided by Scaleway Dedibox
        address <your_prefix>:<your_chosen_suffix>
        netmask 64
    ```
2. Open the DHCPCD configuration file located at `/etc/dhcpcd.conf` in a text editor of your choice and edit it as follows:
    ```
    # Inform the DHCP server of our hostname for DDNS.
    hostname

    # This parameter allows only selected interfaces to use the client
    allowinterfaces eth*

    # Use the same DUID + IAID as set in DHCPv6 for DHCPv4 ClientID as per RFC4361.
    duid

    # Persist interface configuration when dhcpcd exits.
    persistent

    # Rapid commit support.
    # Safe to enable by default because it requires the equivalent option set
    # on the server to actually work.
    option rapid_commit

    # A list of options to request from the DHCP server.
    option domain_name_servers, domain_name, domain_search, host_name
    option classless_static_routes
    # Respect the network MTU. This is applied to DHCP routes.
    option interface_mtu

    # A ServerID is required by RFC2131.
    require dhcp_server_identifier

    slaac hwaddr

    debug
    ```
3. Write the [DUID] of your subnet in the file `/var/lib/dhcpcd/duid` using a text editor of your choice, for example `nano`:
    ```
    nano /var/lib/dhcpcd/duid
    ```
4. Enable the DHCPCD service to be started automatically during system boot.
    ```
    systemctl enable dhcpcd.service
    ```
5. Start the service manually.
    ```
    systemctl start dhcpcd.service
    ```
6. Verify the status of the service.
    ```
    systemctl status dhcpcd.service
    ```

    You should see an output similar to the following example: 

    ```

Your server is now ready to communicate with IPv6. For more information about IPv6 at Scaleway Dedibox, refer to our [dedicated documentation](/dedibox-network/ipv6/quickstart/).
