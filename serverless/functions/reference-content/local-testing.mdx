Local testing allows you to run your code on your dev environment with really short deploy time.

Available frameworks :

- [Go](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-functions-go)
- [Python](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-functions-python)

# Local testing

Scaleway Serverless Functions can run outside Scaleway infrastructure, this is useful to setup,
develop and test functions locally. By running them directly on their machines, users can debug them, and analyse logs.

Advantage of testing locally is to use your favorite debugger and test tools for your handler
directly to analyse, debug, monitor and benchmark your function.

## Requirements

Local testing your function will create a local web server that listens to a given port.

You will need to be able to install packages with the dependency manager of the runtime you use 
(ex: `pip`, `go get`...).

## Limits

Building a function locally does not guarantee your function will work on Scaleway Serverless Functions.

This is because we build your function on our build pipelines and it can differs 
about operating system and system libraries available on the build image.

Performances can be different as Serverless Functions involves some [Limitations](/serverless/functions/reference-content/functions-limitations/)
and CPU/Memory settings does not apply to local testing functions.
