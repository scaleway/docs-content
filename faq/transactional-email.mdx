## What is Transactional Email?

Scaleway's Transactional Email service is a fully managed solution dedicated to sending transactional emails. With Transactional Email, you can send your emails via the API or SMTP, add and verify a sending domain, configure SPF and DKIM authentication, and monitor emails via the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/).

## What are transactional emails?

A transactional email is a type of automated, non-promotional email triggered by interactions with a website or an application, e.g. account creation, password modification, new order, payment status, etc. Unlike marketing emails, transactional emails are usually expected by customers and thus, have a much higher open rate than marketing emails.

## Can I use your platform to send my marketing emails?

Scaleway's Transactional Email platform is dedicated to sending transactional emails only. You cannot use Transactional Email to send marketing emails. [Read our anti-spam policy](https://tem.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/antispam_policy.pdf/) for more information.

## How can I configure DNS records to send emails?

You need to [add SPF and DKIM records](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/add-spf-dkim-records-to-your-domain) to be able to send emails. Find out [how to set up your DNS records for other DNS providers](/tutorials/set-up-spf-dkim-for-dns-providers/).

## How do I know if my domain is valid for sending emails?

After configuring your SPF and DKIM records, you must launch a verification of the domain either via [the console](https://console.scaleway.com/transactional-email/domains/) in the **DNS verification** tab, or the [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/transactional-email/#path-domains-display-spf-and-dkim-records-status-and-potential-errors/). You will then receive an email informing you whether your domain was validated or if there are errors to fix so it can be validated.

## Do I have to set up an MX record for better email deliverability?

Setting up an [MX record](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts#mx-record) is highly recommended to ensure your email deliverability. Find out [how to add an MX record to your domain](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/add-mx-record-to-your-domain/#how-to-add-your-own-mx-record). You can also [use Scaleway's blackhole MX](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/add-mx-record-to-your-domain/#how-to-add-scaleway's-mx-record) if you do not have your own MX.

## What are the limitations and restrictions when using Transactional Email?

Find out about [limits and quotas](/managed-services/transactional-email/reference-content/tem-capabilities-and-limits/) available for Transactional Email. If you want to increase your quota beyond the values shown on this page, [contact our support team](https://console.scaleway.com/support/create/).

## How is Scaleway's Transactional Email service billed?

At the end of the month, you are billed for the number of emails you sent.
If the number of emails you have sent exceeds the number of emails included in your offer, you will be billed for the excess emails. For example, if you use the free tier of 300 emails per month, and you end up sending 305 emails, you will only be billed for five emails out of the 305 you have sent.
