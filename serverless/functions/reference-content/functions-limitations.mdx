\* Lower limits may apply before account verification. Please contact our support team if you have any questions.

\** Total function memory is the sum of the memory allocated to all your functions at their maximum Scale.

These limits are enforced as [Account quotas](/console/my-account/reference-content/account-quotas/#serverless-functions).
