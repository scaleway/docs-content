macOS 14 Sonoma is now installed by default on Scaleway Mac mini M2 (M2-M) and Mac mini M2 pro (M2-L). 

The Mac mini M1 (M1-M) range will stay on macOS 13 by default for now. If you want to enjoy a smooth macOS 14 migration you can opt-in to our latest macOS configuration improvements by reinstalling your server through the console, then performing a manual upgrade using `softwareupdate`.
