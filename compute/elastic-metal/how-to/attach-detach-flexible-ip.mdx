For each of your servers, you can order up to 64 flexible IPs. You can attach and detach any of your [Elastic Metal flexible IPs](/compute/elastic-metal/concepts/#flexible-ip) to and from any of your Elastic Metal servers. The console provides a drag and drop view to facilitate the allocation of your flexible IPs.

<Message type="important">

  Note that Scaleway offers flexible IPs for [Elastic Metal servers](/compute/elastic-metal/concepts/#elastic-metal-server), [Instances](/compute/instances/concepts/#instance) and [Public Gateways](/network/vpc/concepts/#public-gateway). Each of these sets of flexible IPs is independent, and usable only with that product. Instance flexible IPs cannot be attached to Elastic Metal servers or Public Gateways, and vice versa.

## How to attach a flexible IP to an Elastic Metal server

1. Click **Elastic Metal** in the **Compute** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Elastic Metal dashboard displays.

2. Click the **Flexible IPs** tab.

3. Drag and drop the flexible IP from the **Flexible IP** panel to your server in the **Elastic Metal servers** panel.

  <Message type="tip">

  You can assign flexible IPv4 and IPv6 the same way.

  </Message>

4. Click **Validate** to complete the allocation.

<Message type="note">
  If you are using virtual MAC groups, all flexible IPs sharing the same MAC
  address will be moved from one server to another.

## How to switch the destination host of a flexible IP

1. Click **Elastic Metal** in the **Compute** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Elastic Metal dashboard displays.

2. Click the **Flexible IPs** tab.

3. Configure your services and the [flexible IP](/compute/elastic-metal/how-to/configure-flexible-ip) on the new server to make sure your services remain available without interruption.

4. In the **Elastic Metal servers** panel, drag and drop the flexible IP from its current server to the new server.

5. Click **Validate** to complete. The green dot starts blinking in blue colour, indicating that the flexible IP destination is being updated. Once the configuration has been updated, the blinking dot changes back to green. The flexible IP is being routed now to the new server.
