## Overview

As of July 12 2023, VPC is now in general availability (GA). The arrival of VPC brings changes to the Scaleway Network products portfolio, which are summarized in the table below. Read on to find out more about the detail of these changes.

| Product          | Pre-VPC                            | During VPC Public Beta    | With VPC General Availability |
|------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Private Networks | One offer only: zoned Private Networks (scoped to a single AZ) | Classic offer (zoned Private Networks) continued <br /><br /> Beta offer: possibility to create regional Private Networks in a VPC, with optional migration of existing zoned Private Networks via the API   |  Classic offer (zoned Private Networks) is discontinued. <br /><br />All existing zoned Private Networks are automatically migrated to become regional Private Networks inside a VPC. <br /><br />Private Networks now offer DHCP (see below for more details about DHCP migration). |
| VPC              | ---                                | VPC is introduced. One default VPC in each region is created automatically for all users. <br /><br /> Beta testers can create  regional Private Networks in their VPCs | All users have one default VPC per region automatically created for them. <br /><br /> Users can opt to create additional VPCs. <br /><br />All Private Networks now exist within a VPC.  |
| Public Gateways  | When attached to a Private Network, Public Gateways provide DHCP, NAT & SSH bastion for resources in the network.   |  No change | DHCP functionality leaves Public Gateways and is now built directly into Private Networks. <br /><br/> Public Gateways continue to offer NAT and SSH bastion. |

## VPC GA: What does it mean for Private Networks?

As summarized in the [table](#overview) above, now that VPC is in general availability, you can no longer create new zoned Private Networks. All Private Networks created from now on are regional, exist inside a VPC, and have integrated DHCP.

There is also an impact on pre-existing Private Networks. There are three aspects to this impact:

- **Zoned > Regional**: All pre-existing zoned Private Networks have been automatically migrated by Scaleway, and are now regional Private Networks inside a VPC.
- **DHCP activation**: Prior to VPC GA, DHCP was not itself present on any pre-existing Private Networks. It was instead a feature of the [Public Gateway](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#public-gateway) which could optionally be attached to a Private Network and (if DHCP was activated), automatically assign private IP addresses to attached resources. When VPC went into GA, DHCP functionality was moved from Public Gateways to Private Networks themselves. **Whether or not DHCP has been automatically activated on your pre-existing Private Network depends on the specifities of your configuration**.
- **Managed DNS**: All new Private Networks benefit from Managed DNS, to facilitate resource name resolution between different resources attached to the Private Network. **Private Networks attached to a Public Gateway continue to use the Gateway's DNS**. 

Read on for more information about these three aspects.

## Aspect 1: Zoned to regional

All newly created Private Networks going forward will be regional in scope. All pre-existing zoned Private Networks have been automatically migrated by Scaleway, to become regional Private Networks inside a VPC.

- This was planned as a seamless migration with no downtime.
- Private Networks in `PAR-1`, `PAR-2` or `PAR-3` became scoped to the whole `PAR` region, Private Networks from `AMS-1` or `AMS-2` became scoped to the whole `AMS` region, and Private Networks from `WAW-1` or `WAW-2` became scoped to the whole `WAW` region.
- You can now attach resources from any of the AZs within the region of a Private Network. This gives you a Private Network where, for example, an Elastic Metal server in `PAR-2` can communicate with a Managed Database in `PAR-1`.
- One default VPC for each Scaleway region has been created per [Project](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#project), and your newly migrated Private Networks are accessible from within the default VPC for their region.
    
## Aspect 2: DHCP on Private Networks

From now on, **whenever you create a new Private Network**, as well as being regional in its scope, it will also have **DHCP built into it**. This means:

- When creating a Private Network: 
  - A managed DHCP server is activated on the Private Network. This cannot be deactivated. The IPv4 address of Private Networks' DHCP server is `169.254.169.254`. The IPv6 address is `fe80:200:22ff:fe05:ca1e`.
  - You are given the choice to let us automatically generate IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR blocks (subnets) for you, or to define your own IPv4 CIDR block for the network.
- When you attach a resource to the Private Network, it automatically gets a private IP address assigned to it from this subnet via DHCP. The IP is allocated when the resource is attached to a Private Network, and released only when the resource is detached or deleted. Resources are also reachable just by using their name. Essentially, you can let Scaleway manage your IPs, with no hassle for you.
- These IP addresses are managed by our internal IPAM, which is the only source of truth and ensures full consistency.
- IP addresses are allocated and assigned to your resources: they are fixed and (for now) cannot be defined by the user, beyond definition of the CIDR block at the time of network creation. Watch this space for future developments in terms of Scaleway's IPAM and the functionality available to users.

<Message type="note">

**What if I still want to create a new Private Network and manage the attached resources' IPs by myself?** The Private Network's DHCP server will be activated by default upon creation of the network, and cannot be deactivated. You can configure your resources' network interfaces yourself, but they will not be compatible with our managed products, as they're integrated with IPAM. We highly recommend letting us do all the "dirty work": you can simply relax and enjoy our fully-integrated ecosystem. Alternatively, you can wait for our currently-internal IPAM to offer more public features, such as IP reservation. However, at the time of writing, there is no ETA for this.

### DHCP activation on pre-existing Private Networks

Whether or not the managed DHCP server has been automatically activated on your pre-existing Private Networks depends on your configuration:

| Your configuration                                                | Impact                                                                  | 
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| I have a Private Network, with no Public Gateway attached to it   | DHCP has **not** been automatically activated on your Private Network, to avoid any conflicts with your existing IP addressing. <br /><br/>You should see a button in the Scaleway console inviting you to activate DHCP if/when you are ready. Note that activating DHCP is permanent, and there is no way to undo the activation, so proceed with caution. |
| I have a Private Network, attached to a Public Gateway, but DHCP is disabled on the gateway.   | DHCP has **not** be automatically activated on your Private Network, to avoid any conflicts with your existing IP addressing.  <br /><br/>You should see a button in the Scaleway console inviting you to activate DHCP if/when you are ready. Note that activating DHCP is permanent, and there is no way to undo the activation, so proceed with caution. |
| I have a Private Network, attached to a Public Gateway, and DHCP is enabled on the gateway.   | DHCP **has** been automatically activated on your Private Network, and cannot be deactivated. We take care of IP management of your resources within your Private Network (see details above). <br /><br/>All the Public Gateway's leases are synchronized with the managed DHCP, so there is no impact for you and no action is necessary. |
| I have a Private Network with my own DHCP server running on it | We assume that your network is therefore not attached to a Public Gateway with DHCP enabled (which would cause conflicts with your own DHCP server). DHCP has **not** been automatically activated on your Private Network, to avoid any conflicts with your existing IP addressing. <br /><br/>You should see a button in the Scaleway console inviting you to activate DHCP if/when you are ready. Note that activating DHCP is permanent, and there is no way to undo the activation, so proceed with caution. |

If you fall into one of the cases where DHCP is not automatically activated for you, as well as seeing an **Activate DHCP** button in the Scaleway console, you can also activate via the API if you prefer.

See the dedicated documentation on [activating DHCP](/network/vpc/how-to/activate-dhcp/)

Any static DHCP reservations (static leases) configured via a Public Gateway have been transparently migrated. Going forward, [DHCP reservations via the Public Gateway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/public-gateway/) and other devtools are deprecated but still available, to avoid breaking changes. They are no longer available via the console. In the future (no ETA), reservations should be available on Private Networks through IPAM.

## Aspect 3: DNS on Private Networks

From the time of GA, all newly created Private Networks benefit from our managed DNS, to facilitate resource name resolution between different resources attached to the Private Network.

### Managed DNS activation on pre-existing Private Networks

Whether or not managed DNS is activated on your pre-existing Private Network depends on whether it is attached to a Public Gateway: 

- **Private Networks not attached to a Public Gateway**: Managed DNS is automatically activated on these Private Networks. 
- **Private Networks attached to a Public Gateway**: Managed DNS is **not** automatically activated on these Private Networks. They will continue to use the DNS of the gateway, to enable resource name resolution between different attached Private Networks. This will also be the case whenever you attach new Private Networks to a Public Gateway in the future: the DNS of the gateway will always take priority. 

Watch this space for future developments and features in this area.

## Public Gateways and VPC

As a temporary measure, until a version of Public Gateway is released which is fully compatible with our [internal IPAM](/network/vpc/concepts/#ipam), you will observe the following behavior after VPC enters GA:

- For each Public Gateway (newly-created or pre-existing), a new VPC is automatically created to hold its subnets and route table. The VPC will take the name of the Public Gateway, though you can [change the VPC's name](/network/vpc/how-to/create-vpc/#how-to-edit-a-vpc's-name-and-tags) if you wish.
- When a Private Network is attached to a Public Gateway, it is moved to the gateway's VPC. 

<Message type="important">
**You must not delete the VPC created by the Public Gateway**. Doing so would prevent the gateway from being attached to any Private Networks, as they would find themselves unable to migrate to the correct VPC during the attachment process. The only solution at this point is to delete the Public Gateway itself and create a new one (triggering the creation of a new VPC for it which should be left in place).
</Message>

This is not a permanent feature, and we are working to render Public Gateways fully compatible with IPAM without this workaround being needed, as soon as possible.

## Impacts on the rest of the Scaleway ecosystem

The general availability of VPC brings the following changes to our devtools and console:

**Scaleway console**
- The existing **Private Networks** section, available from the main menu (side bar) of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/), will soon cease to be accessible. Instead, you should select **VPC** in the side bar, and then click on the relevant VPC, to access and manage your Private Networks.
- The DHCP dashboard for **Public Gateways** is no longer available, as this functionality has moved to Private Networks.

**API**
- The VPC v1 zoned API (which actually only concerns Private Networks and not VPC as it is now understood) will keep working, but is deprecated and has been moved to read only. The VPC v2 API, covering both VPCs and Private Networks with regional scope and DHCP, is the new default API. Note that on the [VPC API documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/vpc/), you can select v1 or v2 from the drop down menu at the top to navigate between the two versions.
- [DHCP reservations via the Public Gateway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/public-gateway/) are deprecated but still available, to avoid breaking changes. In the future (no ETA), reservations should be available on Private Networks through IPAM.

**CLI**
- As the CLI does not support multiple versions of an API, new and future versions will drop the VPC v1 API in favor of v2.
- DHCP reservations via the Public Gateway have been deprecated but are still available, to avoid breaking changes. In the future (no ETA), reservations should be available on Private Networks through IPAM.

**Terraform**
- The property that previously existed on Private Network resources, to specify whether they are regional or not and allow use of the correct underlying API (VPC v1 or v2), has been deprecated.
- DHCP reservations via the Public Gateway are now deprecated but still available, to avoid breaking changes. In the future (no ETA), reservations should be available on Private Networks through IPAM.

## Why are we making these changes?

Security and networking are not easy. Mistakes can be made and details can be forgotten which can lead to conflicts in your configuration or serious security holes in your infrastructure. 

We are aiming to make it as easy as possible for our customers to create a secure infrastructure, with resources reachable in a simple yet safe way, able to communicate with each other without having to be exposed on the public Internet.

Each Scaleway Project gets a default VPC for each region. From there, it only takes a couple of clicks to create a Private Network with built-in DHCP in a VPC. No network configuration is required, all the defaults are set up and ready to go. We even take care of making sure that each Private Network gets a large enough subnet that it will not overlap with that of any other Private Networks inside the same VPC.

As you attach your resources to the Private Network, they automatically get a fixed private IP address inside that subnet. They are also reachable just by using their name as we provide "Private DNS" resolution inside a Private Network.

We believe that plug and play is the way, and are aiming to provide you with everything you need to get your infrastructure up and running, as securely as possible, with minimal hassle.
