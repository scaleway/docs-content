This guide provides detailed instructions on how to access your [Mac mini](/bare-metal/apple-silicon/concepts/#mac-mini) using remote desktop clients.

The macOS on your Mac mini uses the VNC protocol with additional Apple-specific enhancements to provide a remote desktop access.
Remote desktop allows you to visualize the graphical screen output of a remote computer and interact with it using your local keyboard and mouse.
The VNC protocol is platform-independent, supporting Linux, Windows, and macOS, ensuring a seamless connection experience regardless of your operating system.

    If your local machine runs macOS, you can use the Scaleway console to connect to your Mac mini using the built-in Apple ARD client.

    1. Click **Apple Silicon** in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu. A list of your Mac minis will be displayed.

        Your remote desktop client opens, and you can log in to the graphical environment of macOS using the default user "m1" and your password.

        <Message type="note">
          macOS may ask for your password once logged into the remote desktop session. Change the keyboard layout of macOS to your computer's local keyboard layout before entering the password. Click "U.S. keyboard" in the top right corner to display a list of all available keyboard layouts.
