This section contains usage limits that apply when using Serverless Jobs.

## Jobs resource limitations

| Resource                      | Limit      | Scope        |
|-------------------------------|------------|--------------|
| Number of job definitions max | 1000       | Organization |
| Max parallel jobs             | 400        | Organization |
| Max ephemeral storage         | 10 GB      | Job run      |
| CPU max                       | 6 vCPU     | Job run      |
| Memory max                    | 16 GB      | Job run      |
| Timeout                       | 24h        | Job run      |
| Job runs history              | 60 days    | Job run      |

## Default values for CPU and memory limits

When the job vCPU and/or memory are not provided by the client, these default values are automatically used:

| Resources | Default value  |
|-----------|----------------|
| CPU       | 1120 mvCPU     |
| Memory    | 2048 MB        |

## Architecture

Image target platform must be: `linux/amd64`.

<Message type="note">
    Images with a different platform will generate an error when running the job.
</Message>

For example, if you build an image using an ARM CPU, such as Apple silicon M series, your image will be in the `arm64` architecture, and you will have an error message during deployment.

You must ensure that you build your image to target `amd64` architecture, to achieve this there are multiple solutions:
* You can use the following docker command: `docker build --platform linux/amd64 .`, or
* You can use an Instance with `amd64` architecture to run your builds.

## Ports restrictions

In order to ensure the proper functioning of the product, we restrict the use of certain ports and environment variables.

* Blocked ports:
  * **25**: Due to potential abuse (spam), no outbound traffic is allowed through this port, except from Scaleway Transactional Email SMTP servers.
  * **465**: Due to potential abuse (spam), no outbound traffic is allowed through this port, except from Scaleway Transactional Email SMTP servers.

### Dedicated IP

**Not available:** Serverless products are designed to abstract away infrastructure management, to be easily scalable, and to be cost-efficient and simple. So dedicated IPs are not supported for this product.

## Private Network and Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) compatibility

Refer to the [dedicated FAQ](/serverless-jobs/faq/#how-can-i-configure-access-to-a-private-network-or-virtual-private-cloud-vpc) for more information on Serverless Jobs compatibility with Private Networks and [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](/vpc/).

## Image size

We recommend keeping your image size **below 2 GB** to ensure faster deployment.

### Tips for keeping image size down

* Use lightweight distribution like *Alpine*
* Minimize layers and unnecessary dependencies
* Clean up temp files and cache (e.g., `rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` in Debian-based images)
* Use multi-stage builds to keep only runtime essentials. [Example](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-examples/blob/a7a3b5fc3427ec0f1391aaa78957f91af266867c/containers/rust-hello-world/Dockerfile#L14)
