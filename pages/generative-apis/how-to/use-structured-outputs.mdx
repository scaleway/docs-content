Structured outputs allow users to get consistent, machine-readable JSON format responses from language models.
JSON, as a widely-used format, enables seamless integration with a variety of platforms and applications. Its interoperability is crucial for developers aiming to incorporate AI functionality into their current systems with minimal adjustments.

By specifying a response format when using the [Chat Completions API](/generative-apis/api-cli/using-chat-api/), you can ensure that responses are returned in a JSON structure.
There are two main modes for generating JSON: **Object Mode** (schemaless) and **Schema Mode** (deterministic, structured output).

There are several ways to interact with language models:
- The Scaleway [console](https://console.scaleway.com) provides a complete [playground](/generative-apis/how-to/query-language-models/#accessing-the-playground), aiming to test models, adapt parameters, and observe how these changes affect the output in real-time.
- Via the [Chat API](/generative-apis/how-to/query-language-models/#querying-language-models-via-api)

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) for API authentication
- Python 3.7+ installed on your system

## Types of structured outputs

- **Structured outputs (schema mode)**:
   - Type `{"type": "json_schema"}`
   - This mode enforces a strict schema format, where the output adheres to the predefined structure.
   - Supports complex types and validation mechanisms as per the [JSON schema specification](https://json-schema.org/specification/), including nested schemas composition (`anyOf`, `allOf`, `oneOf` etc), `$ref`, `all` types, and regular expressions.

- **JSON mode** (Legacy method):
   - Type: `{"type": "json_object"}`
   - This mode is non-deterministic and allows the model to output a JSON object without strict validation.
   - Useful for flexible outputs when you expect the model to infer a reasonable structure based on your prompt.
   - JSON mode is older and has been used by developers since early API implementations, but lacks reliability in response formats.

<Message type="note">
    - All LLMs in the Scaleway library support **Structured outputs** and **JSON mode**. However, a schemaless **JSON mode** will produce lower quality results and is not recommended.

## Code examples

<Message type="tip">
    Before diving into the code examples, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
    ```bash
    pip install openai pydantic
    ```
</Message>

The following Python examples demonstrate how to use **Structured outputs** to generate structured responses.

We are using the base code below to send our LLM a voice note transcript to structure:

```python
import json
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

# Set your preferred model
MODEL = "llama-3.1-8b-instruct"

# Set your API key
API_KEY = "<SCW_API_KEY>"

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.scaleway.ai/v1",
    api_key=API_KEY,
)

# Define the schema for the output using Pydantic
class VoiceNote(BaseModel):
    title: str = Field(description="A title for the voice note")
    summary: str = Field(description="A short one sentence summary of the voice note.")
    actionItems: list[str] = Field(description="A list of action items from the voice note")

# Transcript to use for the output
TRANSCRIPT = ( 
    "Good evening! It's 6:30 PM, and I'm just getting home from work. I have a few things to do " 
    "before I can relax. First, I'll need to water the plants in the garden since they've been in the sun all day. " 
    "Then, I'll start preparing dinner. I think a simple pasta dish with some garlic bread should be good. " 
    "While that's cooking, I'll catch up on a couple of phone calls I missed earlier."
)
```

### Using structured outputs with JSON schema (Pydantic)

Using [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/models/), users can define the schema as a Python class and enforce the model to return results adhering to this schema.

```python
extract = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "The following is a voice message transcript. Only answer in JSON using '{' as the first character.",
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": TRANSCRIPT,
        },
    ],
    model=MODEL,
    response_format={
        "type": "json_schema",
        "json_schema": {
            "name": "VoiceNote",
            "schema": VoiceNote.model_json_schema(),
        }
    },
)
output = json.loads(extract.choices[0].message.content)
print(json.dumps(output, indent=2))
```

Output example:
```json
{
  "title": "To-Do List",
  "summary": "Returning from work, need to complete tasks before relaxing",
  "actionItems": [
    "Water garden",
    "Prepare dinner: pasta dish with garlic bread",
    "Catch up on missed phone calls"
  ]
}
```

<Message type="tip">
    Structured outputs accuracy may vary between models. For instance, with Llama models, we suggest adding a description of the field looked for in `response_format` and in `system` or `user` messages. In our example this would mean adding a system prompt similar to:
    ```bash
    "content": "The following is a voice message transcript. Provide the message title, summary and action items. Only answer in JSON using '{' as the first character.",
    ```
    For additional optimization or troubleshooting, see [Structured output (e.g., JSON) is not working correctly](/generative-apis/troubleshooting/fixing-common-issues/#structured-output-eg-json-is-not-working-correctly).

### Using structured outputs with JSON schema (manual definition)

Alternatively, users can manually define the JSON schema inline when calling the model.

```python
extract = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "The following is a voice message transcript. Only answer in JSON using '{' as the first character.",
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": TRANSCRIPT,
        },
    ],
    model=MODEL,
    response_format={
        "type": "json_schema",
        "json_schema": {
            "name": "VoiceNote", 
            "schema": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "title": {"type": "string"},
                    "summary": {"type": "string"},
                    "actionItems": {
                        "type": "array",
                        "items": {"type": "string"}
                    }
                },
                "additionalProperties": False,
                "required": ["title", "summary", "actionItems"]
            }
        }
    }
)
output = json.loads(extract.choices[0].message.content)
print(json.dumps(output, indent=2))
```

Output example:
```json
{
  "title": "Evening Routine",
  "actionItems": [
    "Water the plants",
    "Cook dinner (pasta and garlic bread)",
    "Make phone calls"
  ],
  "summary": "Made a list of tasks to accomplish before relaxing tonight"
}
```

<Message type="tip">
  When using the OpenAI SDKs like in the examples above, you are expected to set `additionalProperties` to false, and to specify all your properties as required.
</Message>

### Using JSON mode (schemaless, Legacy method)

<Message type="important">
  - When using the OpenAI SDKs as in the examples above, you are expected to set `additionalProperties` to false, and to specify all your properties as required.
  - JSON mode: It is important to explicitly ask the model to generate a JSON output either in the system prompt or user prompt. To prevent infinite generations, model providers most often encourage users to ask the model for short JSON objects. Prompt example: `Only answer in JSON using '{' as the first character.`.
</Message>

In JSON mode, you can prompt the model to output a JSON object without enforcing a strict schema.

```python
extract = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "The following is a voice message transcript. Only answer in JSON using '{' as the first character.",
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": TRANSCRIPT,
        },
    ],
    model=MODEL,
    response_format={
        "type": "json_object",
    },
)
output = json.loads(extract.choices[0].message.content)
print(json.dumps(output, indent=2))
```

Output example:
```json
{
  "current_time": "6:30 PM",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "task": "water the plants in the garden",
      "priority": "high"
    },
    {
      "task": "prepare dinner (pasta with garlic bread)",
      "priority": "high"
    },
    {
      "task": "catch up on phone calls",
      "priority": "medium"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Conclusion

Using structured outputs with LLMs can significantly improve their reliability, especially to implement agentic use cases.

- **Structured outputs** provide strict adherence to a predefined schema, ensuring consistency.
- **JSON mode** (Legacy Method) is flexible but less predictable.

We recommend using structured outputs (`json_schema`) for most use cases.
