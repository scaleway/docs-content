## Overview

### What is the minimum allocation period for an Apple silicon Mac mini?
The minimum lease period for Apple silicon is 24 hours due to licensing restrictions. A Mac mini can only be deleted after this 24-hour minimum lease period.
You can opt for automatic deletion after 24 hours by enabling this setting in the console.

## Specifications

### What is preinstalled on the Mac mini?
When you rent a Mac mini, it comes with a bare environment. The pre-installed tools include:
- The latest Xcode version compatible with the OS
- MacPorts for package management
- `fail2ban` for VNC access filtering
- `scw-agent`, a daemon maintained by Scaleway to provide essential integration services such as updating your SSH keys.

### What operations are unsupported?
Certain operations are restricted by default MDM configuration profiles:
- You don't have access to the physical machine, thus no access to macOS recovery.
- Certain admin actions, like system Time Machine restoration and boot system policies, are not possible.

## Pricing and billing

### Do I pay for my Mac mini when I am not using it?
Yes, you pay for your Mac mini as long as it is assigned to your account. You must explicitly delete it in the console or via the CLI to stop charges. For deletion instructions, see [How to delete Mac mini](/apple-silicon/how-to/delete-mac-mini/).

## Usage and management

### How can I reinstall my Mac mini?
To reinstall your Mac mini, navigate to the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/), then go to the **Apple silicon** page.
From there, select the server you wish to reinstall and locate the **Reinstall** button.
Click it, and you will be prompted to choose the macOS version for the reinstallation process.
Once selected, the reinstallation will commence automatically.

### How can I back up my Mac mini?
You can back up your Mac mini using a backup solution of your choice. Examples include:
- [Restic](/tutorials/restic-s3-backup/) for command-line backups.
- [Arq Backup](/tutorials/arqbackup-pc-mac/) for graphical interface backups.

Both solutions allow you to store backups on our [Object Storage](/object-storage/quickstart/).

## Quotas and limitations

### How many public IP addresses can I assign to a Mac mini?
Each Mac mini can have one IPv4 address and one IPv6 subnet (`/128`).

## Compatibility and integration

### Are Mac minis compatible with Private Networks?
Yes, you can now activate the Private Networks feature on your Mac mini, and attach it to a Private Network so that it can securely communicate with other Scaleway resources. For full details, see the [Mac mini Private Networks documentation](/apple-silicon/how-to/use-private-networks/).

### Can I enable FileVault on a hosted Mac mini?
[FileVault](https://support.apple.com/fr-fr/guide/mac-help/flvlt001/15.0/mac/15.0) is a macOS feature that encrypts your disk to protect your data. However, enabling FileVault requires entering a security key or password to unlock the disk and fully boot macOS. As a result, remote services such as Remote Desktop and SSH are unavailable until the key is entered.

For a hosted Mac mini, this means remote connections cannot be established without physical access to the machine to input the FileVault security key or user password, making FileVault impractical for remotely managed systems.

### Can I disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) on a hosted Mac mini?

It is not possible to disable SIP on a hosted Mac mini. Disabling SIP requires **physical access to the machine** because of macOS’s security model, which involves pressing the Mac’s power button to adjust security settings.

If your application depends on SIP being disabled, the recommended workaround is to **run macOS in a virtual machine** where SIP can be disabled. We suggest using [UTM](/apple-silicon/how-to/setup-vm-with-utm/#installating-utm), an open-source virtualization solution for macOS. Detailed instructions on disabling SIP in UTM are available [here](https://docs.getutm.app/advanced/recovery/).
