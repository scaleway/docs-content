3. [Download](ftp://ftp.supermicro.nl/CDR_Images/CDR-A1-UP/CDR-A1-UP_1.00_for_Intel_A1_UP_platform.iso) the driver package from the Supermicro FTP server on your local computer.
4. Access the KVM-over-IP device by clicking **Remote Console Preview**.
5. Click **Virtual Media** > **Virtual Storage**. A popup displays:
