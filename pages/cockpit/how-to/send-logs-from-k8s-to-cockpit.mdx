In this page, we will show you how to send application logs from your Kubernetes cluster to your Cockpit using either a Helm chart or deploying a Helm chart with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) or [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/).

We will use the [k8s-monitoring](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/grafana/k8s-monitoring/1.6.16) Helm Chart, which installs an Alloy Daemon set to export your Kubernetes cluster's logs to your Cockpit.

<Requirements />

 - A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
 - [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
 - [Created](/cockpit/how-to/create-external-data-sources/) a [custom data source](/cockpit/concepts/#custom-data) of the [logs type](/cockpit/concepts/#data-types)
 - [Created](/cockpit/how-to/create-token/) a Cockpit token in the same region as the logs data source
 - A running Kubernetes cluster containing your deployed application
 - [Created](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) an API key and retrieved your API secret key

  - Sending logs for Scaleway resources or personal data using an external path is a billable feature. In addition, any data that you push yourself is billed, even if you send data from Scaleway products.

## Configure the Helm chart

Create a `values.yml` file to configure your Helm chart, using the example below. Make sure that you replace `$SCW_CLUSTER_NAME` with the name of your Scaleway Kubernetes cluster, `COCKPIT_CUSTOM_LOGS_DATASOURCE_URL` with the URL of your custom logs data source (you can find it under the "API URL" section in the [Data sources tab](https://console.scaleway.com/cockpit/dataSource) of the Scaleway console), and `$COCKPIT_TOKEN` with your Cockpit token.

```yaml
cluster:
  name: "$SCW_CLUSTER_NAME"
global:
  scrape_interval: 60s
destinations:
  - name: "my-cockpit-logs"
    type: "loki"
    protocol: "http"
    logs:
      enabled: true
    url: "$COCKPIT_CUSTOM_LOGS_DATASOURCE_URL/loki/api/v1/push" ##You can find your logs URL in the **Data sources** tab of the Scaleway console under the "API URL" section of the relevant data source
    tenantId: "$COCKPIT_TOKEN"

    metrics:
      enabled: false
    traces:
      enabled: false
clusterEvents:
  enabled: true
  destinations: ["my-cockpit-logs"]
# -- Node logs.
nodeLogs:
    enabled: true
    destinations: ["my-cockpit-logs"]
# -- Pod logs.
podLogs:
  enabled: true
  destinations: ["my-cockpit-logs"]
  volumeGatherSettings:
    onlyGatherNewLogLines: true

# An Alloy instance for collecting log data.
alloy-logs:
  enabled: true
  logging:
    level: info
    format: logfmt
alloy-singleton:
  enabled: true
```

<Message type="note">
    The template above is for sending logs to your Cockpit. You can also configure it to send metrics to Cockpit using this Helm chart.
    Refer to our dedicated documentation to [send metrics from your cluster to Cockpit](/cockpit/how-to/send-metrics-from-k8s-to-cockpit).

## Send Kubernetes logs using Helm chart

Once you have configured your `values.yml` file, you can use Helm to deploy the log-forwarding configuration to your Kubernetes cluster. Before installing the Helm chart, ensure that your `kubectl` tool is properly connected to your Kubernetes cluster. `kubectl` is the command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.

1. [Connect](/kubernetes/how-to/connect-cluster-kubectl/) `kubectl` to your Kubernetes cluster
2. Run the commands below to install the `k8s-monitoring` Helm chart. Make sure that you replace `/your-path/to/values.yml` with the correct path where your `values.yml` file is stored. Make sure that you also replace `name-of-your-choice-for-your-log-ingester` with a clear name (ex. `alloy-logs-ingester`).
    ```
    helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
    helm repo update
    helm install -f /your-path/to/values.yml name-of-your-choice-for-your-log-ingester grafana/k8s-monitoring --version 2.0.21
    ```
      <Message type="iam">
        The `-f` flag specifies the path to your `values.yml` file, which contains the configuration for the Helm chart. <br /><br />
        Helm installs the `k8s-monitoring` chart, which includes the Alloy DaemonSet configured to collect logs from your Kubernetes cluster. <br /><br />
        The DaemonSet ensures that a pod is running on each node in your cluster, which collects logs and forwards them to the specified Loki endpoint in your Cockpit.

3. Optionally, run the following command to check the status of the release and ensure it was installed:

      ```
      helm list
      ```

## Send Kubernetes logs using Helm chart with Terraform/OpenTofu

You can also use Terraform/OpenTofu to manage and deploy Helm charts, providing you with more automation and consistency to manage your Kubernetes resources.

1. Create a `provider.tf` file and paste the following template to set up the Helm Terraform/OpenTofu provider:
    ```terraform
    provider "helm" {
      kubernetes {
        host = your_k8s_cluster_host # The URL of your Kubernetes API server.
        token = your_k8s_cluster_token # Authentication token to access the cluster.
        cluster_ca_certificate = base64decode(
        your_k8s_cluster_ca_certificate # The cluster's CA certificate.
        )
      }
    }
    ```
2. Create a `maint.tf` file and paste the following template to create a Helm release resource. Make sure that you replace `/your-path/to/values.yml` with the actual path to your values file.
    ```
    resource "helm_release" "alloy" {
      name = "name-of-your-log-ingester"
      repository = "https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts"
      chart = "k8s-monitoring"
      version = "2.0.2"

      namespace = "log-ingester"
      create_namespace = true
      values = [file("/your-path/to/values.yml")]
    }
    ```
3. Save your changes.
4. Run `terraform init` to initialize your Terraform/OpenTofu configuration and download any necessary providers.
5. Run `terraform apply` to apply your configuration.
6. Type `yes` when prompted to confirm the actions.

## Explore your logs in Cockpit

1. Click **Cockpit** in the **Monitoring** section of the Scaleway [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Cockpit Overview** page displays.
2. Click **Open dashboards** to open your preconfigured dashboards in Grafana. You are redirected to the Grafana website.
3. Log in to Grafana using your [Grafana credentials](/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/).
4. Click the Grafana icon in the top left side of your screen to open the menu, then click **Explore**.
5. Select your custom data source in the search drop-down on the upper left corner of your screen.
6. In the **Labels filter** drop-down, select the `cluster` label and in the **Value** drop-down, select your cluster.
7. Optionally, click the **Clock** icon on the top right corner of your screen and filter by time range.
8. Click **Run query** to see your logs. An output similar to the following should display.
