Scaleway [Block Storage](/storage/block/concepts/#block-device) provides network-attached storage that can be plugged in and out of [Instances](/compute/instances/concepts/#instance) like a virtual hard-drive. Block Storage devices are independent of the local storage of Instances, and the fact that they are accessed over a network connection makes it easy to move them between Instances in the same [Availability Zone](/compute/instances/concepts/#availability-zone).

From the user's point of view, once [mounted](/storage/block/api-cli/managing-a-volume/#mounting-and-using-a-volume), the block device behaves like a regular disk.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created an [Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance)

## How to create a Block Storage volume

1. Click **Block Storage** in the **Storage** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The Block Storage page displays.
2. Click **+ Create volume**.
3. Follow the steps in the creation wizard:
    - Choose an [Availability Zone](/compute/instances/concepts/#availability-zone).
    - Configure the volume:
        - Enter a name for your volume or leave the automatically generated name.
        - Select an [IOPS](/storage/block/concepts/#iops).
        <Message type="important">
          You cannot edit the IOPS after you create your volume.
        </Message>

        - Define a volume size.
        <Message type="important">
          The volume size must be at least 5GB.
        </Message>
    - Select an Instance from the drop-down to attach your volume. This step is optional.
    - Check the estimated cost.
4. Click **Create volume**. The volumes overview page displays.
    <Message type="important">
      The volume must be in the same Availability Zone as the Instance you want to connect it to.
    </Message>

## How to attach a Block Storage volume to an Instance

1. Click **Block Storage** in the **Storage** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. Your volumes display.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Attach to Instance** next to the volume of your choice. A pop-up displays.
3. Select the Instance to which you want to attach your volume from the drop-down.
4. Click **Attach volume to Instance**.

## How to mount and use a Block Storage volume

In order to mount and use your Block Storage volume, you need to connect to the Instance it is attached to via SSH.
Then, check that the volume is available, format it, and mount it, following the instructions below.

### How to verify device availability

1. Open a terminal and use the following command to connect to your Instance. Make sure that you replace `<your_instance_ip>` with your Instance's IP. You can also find the SSH command in your Instance's **Overview** tab in the Scaleway console.
    ```
    ssh root@<your_instance_ip>
    ```
2. Use the `lsblk` command to make sure your volume is available:
    ```
    lsblk
    ```


   You should see an output similar to the following. The root Block volume `sda`, runs your OS. The Block volume named `sdb` is the one we will be mounting to the Instance.

    ```sh no-copy
    root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# lsblk
    NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
    sda       8:0    0 18.6G  0 disk
    ├─sda1    8:1    0 18.5G  0 part /
    ├─sda14   8:14   0    4M  0 part
    └─sda15   8:15   0  106M  0 part /boot/efi
    sdb       8:16   0 27.9G  0 disk
    ```

<Message type="note">
  The Scaleway ecosystem uses [GB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte/) to define storage sizes and not [GiB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibibyte/) as the default on linux.

### How to format the Block Storage volume

Formatting your volume prepares it for storing files.

1. In the same terminal as the steps above, create a filesystem with the following command. This command uses the `ext4` filesystem, though you can choose another if you prefer.
    ```
    # Make sure that you replace `/dev/sdX` with the name of your volume
    mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX
    ```
2. Make sure your filesystem is correctly created by running the `lsblk -f` command.
    ```
    lsblk -f
    ```

  You should see an output like the following. Check that the `FSTYPE` field matches `ext4` for your Block volume. In this example, we have formatted the `sdb` volume.

  ```sh no-copy
    root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# lsblk -f
    NAME FSTYPE FSVER LABEL UUID                                 FSAVAIL FSUSE% MOUNTPOINTS
    sda
    ├─sda1
    │    ext4   1.0   cloudimg-rootfs
    │                       cf5b092b-9a8b-49e9-980c-b44b5e3ed197   14.5G    18% /
    ├─sda14
    │
    └─sda15
        vfat   FAT32 UEFI  D590-3FD4                              98.3M     6% /boot/efi
    sdb  ext4   1.0         d36bdf8b-b2ff-4e2b-9736-cc05940aea35
  ```


### How to mount the Block Storage volume

Once you have created your filesystem, you need to define where you want to mount your volume, and create a mount point (directory) for it.

1. Create the mount point. Feel free to replace `block-volume` with another name for your mount point.
    ```
    mkdir /mnt/block-volume
    ```
2. Mount the volume. We recommend that you use the `defaults` option, as in the command below.
    ```
    # Make sure that you replace sdX with the name of your volume
    mount -o defaults /dev/sdX /mnt/block-volume
    ```

    If you want to see all available options, you can run `man mount` on your Instance.

3. Make sure your filesystem is properly mounted by running the `lsblk` command.
    ```
    lsblk
    ```

    You should see an output like the following. Check the `MOUNTPOINT` field.

    ```sh no-copy
    root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# lsblk
    NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    sda       8:0    0 18.6G  0 disk
    ├─sda1    8:1    0 18.5G  0 part /
    ├─sda14   8:14   0    4M  0 part
    └─sda15   8:15   0  106M  0 part /boot/efi
    sdb       8:16   0 27.9G  0 disk /mnt/block-volume
    ```

The `sdb` volume is mounted at `/mnt/block-volume`

### How to use fstab for Persistent Mounting

With the current configuration, your volume will not be mounted automatically upon reboot. Use the `/etc/fstab` file to make sure the reboot does not impact your filesystem.

Run the following command to make sure your volume is automatically mounted to your Instance upon reboot. Make sure that you replace `sdX` with your volume.

```
echo "UUID=$(blkid --output value /dev/sdX | head -n1) /mnt/block-volume ext4 defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
```

You can now use your Block Storage volume like a regular disk of your Instance, and store data on it as you wish.
