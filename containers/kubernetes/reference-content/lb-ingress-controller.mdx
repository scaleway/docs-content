## Expose the ingress controller using a Scaleway Load Balancer

By default, ingress controllers on Kapsule are deployed using a [hostPort](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/). This means they are accessible on all cluster nodes on ports 80 and 443. This choice was made to prevent additional costs for users during their test&deployment phase. However, for production-readiness, you might want to use a Load Balancer to expose your services on the internet.

### Deploying a test application

1. Deploy the `cafe-ingress` test application:

```bash
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/main/examples/ingress-resources/basic-auth/cafe.yaml
```

2. Create the ingress object (`coffee-ingress.yaml`) using the DNS wildcard provided by Scaleway:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: Ingress
  metadata:
    name: coffee-ingress
  spec:
    rules:
      - host: YOUR_SCALEWAY_DNS_WILDCARD
        http:
          paths:
            - path: /tea
              pathType: Prefix
              backend:
                service:
                  name: tea-svc
                  port:
                    number: 80
            - path: /coffee
              pathType: Prefix
              backend:
                service:
                  name: coffee-svc
                  port:
                    number: 80
  ```

  <Message type="note">
    You DNS wildcard is composed of your cluster ID (e.g. `68362d3b-57c8-4bea-905a-aeb7f9ab95dc`) followed by `.nodes.k8s.<SCW_REGION>.scw.cloud`. For a cluster located in the Paris region, your DNS wildcard could be for example: `hotdrinks.68362d3b-57c8-4bea-905a-aeb7f9ab95dc.nodes.k8s.fr-par.scw.cloud`. 
  </Message>

3. Apply the configuration:

  ```bash
  kubectl create -f coffee-ingress.yaml
  ```

4. Test the ingress:

  ```bash
  curl http://YOUR_SCALEWAY_DNS_WILDCARD/coffee
  ```

## Using a reserved IP with a Load Balancer


1. Reserve an IP address through the Scaleway API:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST "https://api.scaleway.com/lb/v1/regions/$SCW_DEFAULT_REGION/ips" -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"project_id\":\"$SCW_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID\"}" | jq -r .ip_address
  ```

  <Message type="tip">
    If you do not have an API key yet, you can follow our tutorial [How to create API keys](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) to generate one.
  </Message>

  Take note of the IP address, referred to as `RESERVED_IP` from now on.

### Using the reserved IP in Kubernetes

1. Patch `tea-svc` to use the reserved IP with a `LoadBalancer` service:

   ```bash
   kubectl patch svc tea-svc --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"loadBalancerIP": "RESERVED_IP","type":"LoadBalancer"}}'
   ```

2. Delete `tea-svc`:

   ```bash
   kubectl delete svc tea-svc
   ```

3. Patch `coffee-svc` to use the reserved IP:

   ```bash
   kubectl patch svc coffee-svc --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"loadBalancerIP": "RESERVED_IP","type":"LoadBalancer"}}'
   ```
