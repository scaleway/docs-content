## Handler not found

### Error Messages

  ```
  Function Handler does not exist, check that you provided the right HANDLER parameter …
  ```

  Or

  ```
  Provided Handler does not exist, or does not export methods properly
  ```

### Cause

The systems cannot find the function which will handle the request. It can be related to an error in your code before your `handle` function.

### Possible solutions

- Make sure to provide the right handler path.

- If you used a zip file, make sure the dependencies are present in your [zip package](/serverless/functions/how-to/package-function-dependencies-in-zip/) 

- If you used the Serverless framework, make sure that the `.serverless` directory created with `serverless package` contains your zip file.

- Make sure that the dependencies folders (`node_modules` or `package` in Python) are in package/include

- Serverless Functions rely on Alpine Linux, therefore, some C-based libraries (`pandas`, `tensorflow`, `numpy`) will not work. Refer to the official documentation to safely add these libraries to your package.

## Too Many Retries

### Error messages

```
Too many retries, sub-runtime server did not come up in 10ms seconds
```

### Cause

This error is returned by the runtime when it cannot process the request. It has several different origins.

### Possible solutions

- Make sure that you only imported the required dependencies and not the complete libraries

- Avoid performing too many initialization operations

- Update your function's resources by provisioning more memory and more vCPU.

## Timeout error 

### Cause

Timeout happens when your function can’t return a results in the defined amount of time.

### Possible solutions

- Increase the Timeout parameter in the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) or with the [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-functions/#path-functions-update-an-existing-function)
- Update your function's resources by provisioning more memory and more vCPU.

## Failed to create a namespace

### Cause

This issue can happen for the following reasons: 

- You created too many namespaces and reached [your account's quota](/console/my-account/reference-content/organization-quotas/#serverless-functions)
- You created too many Registry namespaces and reached [your account's quota](/console/my-account/reference-content/organization-quotas/#container-registry)

### Possible solutions

Make sure that you did not exceed the maximum number of allowed namespaces with the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) or with the [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-functions/#path-namespaces-list-all-your-namespaces).
