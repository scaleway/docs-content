Edge Services is an additional feature for Scaleway Load Balancers and Object Storage buckets. Creating an Edge Services pipeline towards your Object Storage bucket brings you a number of possible benefits:

Read on to learn how to create an Edge Services pipeline for your Object Storage bucket.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An active [Edge Services subscription](/network/edge-services/how-to/subscribe-edge-services/)
- An [Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)

## How to create an Edge Services pipeline

<Message type="tip">
You can create an Edge Services pipeline [from the Object Storage section of the console](/storage/object/how-to/get-started-edge-services/), by navigating to your bucket's dashboard and clicking the **Edge Services** tab. However, in this documentation, we describe how to create a pipeline directly from the **Edge Services** section of the console.
</Message>

1. Click **Edge Services** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu.

2. Click **Create pipeline**. The pipeline creation wizard displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-create-pipeline-os.webp" alt="A screenshot of the Scaleway console shows the Edge Services pipeline creation wizard. It prompts you to select an origin type (Load Balancer or Object Storage), origin bucket, and choose a name for the pipeline." />

3. Select **Object Storage** as the origin type.

4. Choose the bucket you want this pipeline to serve content for, under **Origin bucket**.

5. Enter a name for the pipeline, or leave the randomly generated name in place.

6. Check the summary cost for the pipeline, and click **Create Edge Services pipeline**.

    You are returned to the **Pipelines** tab, where the newly created pipeline now displays.

    Click on the pipeline to go to its **Overview** page and start configuration.

    <Message type="important">

    Your bucket's [visibility](/storage/object/concepts/#visibility) can be set to **private**, but any objects within it that you want to expose via Edge Services must be set to [**public** visibility](/storage/object/how-to/manage-object-visibility/). However, in the case that you are using Edge Services with bucket website, objects can remain private.

## How to access your bucket via Edge Services

Once you have created an Edge Services pipeline for your bucket, you can access your bucket and its content via the following endpoints. Make sure that you replace `bucket-name` with the name of your bucket.

| Endpoint                                | Where to find this endpoint in the console | Notes                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `https://bucket-name.s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud` | The **Bucket settings** tab                | Edge Services is bypassed when the bucket is accessed via this endpoint  |
| `https://bucket-name.svc.edge.scw.cloud`  | The **Edge Services** tab                  | Edge Services serves bucket content when this endpoint is used |

The two endpoints shown above are available as standard. However, with Edge Services, you can also choose to configure a **custom domain** from which your bucket can be accessed. Read more about this in the [next section](/network/edge-services/how-to/configure-custom-domain/).
