Database for Redis™ is a low-latency caching solution based on in-memory data storage. It allows you to easily set up a secure cache and lighten the load on your main database.

1. Click **for Redis™** under **Databases** on the side menu. If you do not have a database already created, the creation page displays.


2. Click **Create Database for Redis™**. The creation wizard displays.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:

    - Choose an Availability Zone. This is the geographical location where your database will be deployed.
    - Select a database configuration. You can choose between:
        - **Cluster mode**: creates the Database as a Cluster composed of three or more nodes.  The cluster uses partitioning to split the keyspace. Each partition is replicated and can be reassigned or elected as the primary when necessary.
        - **Standalone**: creates a standalone database provisioned on a single node.
    - Select a node type.
    - Configure your Network. You can select:
        - **Private Network**: allows your Databases to communicate in an isolated and secure network without the need for a public IP address.
        - **Public Network**: resources in a public network are publicly visible by default. The default Access Control List (ACL) settings allow anybody to connect to resources in your network. You can restrict access by configuring ACLs.
    - Create credentials: add a name and set a password for your user.
    - Enter a name and optional tags for the Database.

4. Click **Create an Instance** to confirm your choices and launch creation.
