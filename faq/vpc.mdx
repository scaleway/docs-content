## VPC

### What is the difference between VPC and a regional Private Network ?
One default VPC (**V**irtual **P**rivate **C**loud) for every available region is automatically created in each Scaleway [Project](/console/my-project/concepts/#project). A VPC offers layer 3 network isolation. Currently, at Public Beta stage, VPC is only available for the Paris region.

A regional Private Network sits inside a VPC. Like our zoned Private Networks, regional Private Networks offer layer 2 network isolation. However, they span all AZs of the region, while zoned Private Networks are scoped to one AZ only. You can create multiple regional Private Networks within a VPC.

In the future, VPC will allow you to define specific routing rules for your Private Networks, interconnect your VPC with other networks, define access control lists and more.

### Can two different regional Private Networks communicate with each other?

No. A regional Private Network spans multiple AZs of the same region, but does not allow communication between two different regional Private Networks. In the future, we plan to release a feature to enable this. In the meantime, it is possible to define your own layer 3 router using a Public Gateway or an Instance connected to both Private Networks.

### Can I keep using my classic, mono-AZ Private Network?
While VPC/regional Private Networks are still in Public Beta, yes. However, for the future General Availablity of this product, mono-AZ Private Networks will be automatically migrated to regional Private Networks.

If you want to migrate an existing mono-AZ Private Network to regional now, [check out our dedicated documentation](/network/vpc/api-cli/vpc-private-beta/#migrating-existing-zonal-private-networks-to-regional-private-networks). Note that this can only be done via the API, not the console.

### What will happen to my current network configuration if I migrate my mono-AZ Private Network to regional Private Networks? 
The transition will be seamless, and you can keep using your existing network configuration. This can be even smoother if you use a Public Gateway with DHCP enabled on your regional Private Network.
