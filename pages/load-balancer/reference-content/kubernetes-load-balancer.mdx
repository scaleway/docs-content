If you are using Scaleway's [managed Kubernetes solution](/kubernetes/quickstart/), you may want to create a Load Balancer in order to expose  an application running inside your cluster to the internet.

Load Balancers for Kubernetes clusters should **always** be provisioned via the cluster's Cloud Controller Manager. It is **not** correct procedure to provision the Load Balancer by creating a Scaleway Load Balancer in the console or via the API, and then attempting to use it as your cluster's external Load Balancer.

Full documentation for creating and configuring a Load Balancer for your cluster can be found in the Kubernetes section, on the following pages:

- [Exposing Kubernetes services to the internet](/kubernetes/reference-content/exposing-services/)
- [Creating, configuring and troubleshooting a Load Balancer service](/kubernetes/reference-content/kubernetes-load-balancer/)
