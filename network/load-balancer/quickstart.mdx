[Load Balancers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/load-balancer/) are highly available and fully-managed Instances which allow you to distribute your workload across your various servers. They ensure the scaling of all your applications while securing their continuous availability, even in the event of heavy traffic. Load Balancers are commonly used to improve the performance and reliability of web sites, applications, databases and other services.

## How to create a Load Balancer

1. Click **Load Balancers** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. If you have not already created a Load Balancer, the product creation page is displayed.

2. Click **Create Load Balancer**. The creation wizard displays.

3. Enter a **name** for your Load Balancer. Optionally, you can also add a **description** and assign **tags** to help organize your Load Balancers.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-load-balancer-name.webp" alt="" />

4. Choose the **Availability Zone** in which your Load Balancer will be deployed geographically. Currently we provide the following Availability Zones:
      - `PAR1`: Paris 1, France.
      - `PAR2`: Paris 2, France (innovative and sustainable availability zone).
      - `AMS1`: Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
      - `AMS2`: Amsterdam 2, The Netherlands.
      - `WAW1`: Warsaw 1, Poland.
      - `WAW2`: Warsaw 2, Poland.

5. Select a Load Balancer **type**, according to your bandwidth needs.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-select-load-balancer.webp" alt="" />

6. Select an **IP address** for your Load Balancer. You can either allocate a new IP, or select one of your existing IPs.

7. Configure your Load Balancer's **[frontend](/network/load-balancer/concepts/#frontends)** by entering a **name** and a **port**. The frontend will listen on this port, and forward the requests it receives from clients to the backend(s). Note that you cannot add an SSL certificate at this stage, but you can [add one after the creation of the Load Balancer](/network/load-balancer/how-to/add-certificate/). You can also add [additional frontends](#how-to-add-frontends) after creation.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-configure-frontend.webp" alt="" />

8. Configure your Load Balancer's **[backend](/network/load-balancer/concepts/#backends)** by entering a **name**, and the **protocol** and **port** it should use to connect to the backend servers. You should also a select a **proxy** protocol option, **health check** method and add the **server IPs** (one or many) of the backend server(s) it should direct traffic to. You can [add additional backends](#how-to-add-backends) after creating your Load Balancer, if required.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-configure-backend.webp" alt="" /> 
    Depending on the options you choose, you may be prompted for additional configurations such as the **Verify certificate** setting if you select the HTTPS protocol. For more information on choosing configuration settings for your Load Balancer's backend, see our [dedicated reference documentation](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/configuring-load-balancer).

9. Configure **advanced settings** if required:
    - **S3 failover**: activate the feature and enter a Scaleway Object Storage [Bucket Website](/storage/object/concepts/#bucket-website) URL (e.g. `https://my-bucket.s3-website.nl-ams.scw.cloud`). If none of your backend servers are available, users will be redirected to this page. 
      <Message type="note">
        The S3 failover feature is only available for Load Balancers using the HTTP protocol on their backend. Find out more about setting up a static website with Object Storage in our [dedicated documentation](/storage/object/how-to/use-bucket-website/).
      </Message>
    - **[Sticky session](/network/load-balancer/concepts/#sticky-session)**: activate the feature if you want a particular user session to stick to the same backend server. This is useful if your users need their requests to be served by a single server in order to maintain a consistent session. If relevant, you will be prompted to enter the name for a cookie that will bind users' sessions to specific backend servers. 

10. Click **Create Load Balancer**.

    <Message type="note">
    * By default, each Load Balancer is created using [round-robin](/network/load-balancer/concepts/#balancing-rules) balancing rules.
    * You can [add additional frontends and backends](/network/load-balancer/how-to/manage-frontends-and-backends/) to your Load Balancer after its creation.

## How to add frontends

You can add more frontends to your Load Balancer after its creation. This allows you to configure different frontends listening on different ports, and to connect different frontends to different backends as required.

1. Click **Load Balancers** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Load Balancer dashboard displays.
2. Click the Load Balancer you want to add frontends to. The Load Balancer information page displays.
3. Click the **Frontends** tab.
4. Click <Icon name="plus" /> to launch the frontend creation wizard.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-frontend.webp" alt="" />
5. Enter a **name** and **port** for your new frontend. Note that each frontend must listen on a different port.
6. Select an [**SSL certificate(s)**](/network/load-balancer/how-to/add-certificate) for your frontend to use, if required. Note that you must already have [created or imported an SSL certificate for your Load Balancer](/network/load-balancer/how-to/add-certificate/) in order to select one here.
7. Choose between **using an existing backend** or **creating a new backend**. Your frontend will direct traffic to the backend you choose here.
    - If using an existing backend, click **Use an existing backend** and select the backend of your choice from the dropdown list.
    - If creating a new backend, click **Create a new backend** and enter a name, port, protocol, proxy protocol, health check type, server IP(s) and advanced settings as required. See our [dedicated documentation](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/configuring-load-balancer/) for help configuring your backend.
8. Under **Advanced Settings**, optionally use the <Icon name="toggle" /> to enable HTTP/3. The availability of this setting depends on your [Load Balancer's configuration](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/http2-http3/)
9. Click **Create Frontend**.

## How to add backends

You can add more backends to your Load Balancer after its creation. Each backend can be connected to a different frontend, allowing you to route traffic through your Load Balancer according to your needs.

1. Click **Load Balancers** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Load Balancer dashboard displays.
2. Click the Load Balancer you want to add backends to. The Load Balancer information page displays.
3. Click the **Backends** tab.
4. Click the green **+** button.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-backend.webp" alt="" />
5. Enter a name, protocol, port, protocol, health check type,  server IP(s) and advanced settings as required for your new backend. See our [dedicated page](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/configuring-load-balancer/) for help configuring your backend, including details of how to set up SSL bridging, offloading or passthrough.
6. Click **Create Backend**.
