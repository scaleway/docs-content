If you forget or lose the password to your [Scaleway](https://console.scaleway.com) account, several methods exist to regain access.

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have a [Scaleway Elements](https://www.scaleway.com/en/elements) account

</Message>

## Passwordless Authentication Using a Magic Link

The [Magic Link](/console/my-account/how-to/sign-in-with-magic-link) allows you to access your account without a password, using two-factor authentication.

Click **Send a Magic Link** in the Login page of the Scaleway console.

A secret link is sent to your e-mail. You can access your account by clicking on the link.

## Password Reset Using Email Validation

If you forget or lose your password, you can request to reset it.

1. Go to the [lost password](https://console.scaleway.com/forgot-password) page of the console:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-forgotten-password-screen.png" />

2. Enter your e-mail address and click **Reset my password**. A password reset link is sent to your e-mail address.

3. Click the link in the e-mail address to reset your password.

4. Enter your new password and click **Reset password** to set the new password for your account. You are redirected to the Login page.

5. Log in to the console by using your e-mail address and the newly set password.

## Password Recovery in Case of Lost Email Account

If you lose access to your e-mail account, it will not be possible to reset the password directly from the Scaleway console.

In case you can no longer access your email account, you must send us a request to update your contact information with the following pieces of identification:

* Email address
* Postal address
* Two different documents proving your identity (passport or local ID card for individual accounts + incorporation certificated for companies)
* A phone number to contact you
* Copy of your last Scaleway Dedibox invoice or the amount charged if you do not have a copy
* Card statement showing the Online by Scaleway bill debit

Once you have gathered all the required documents, the request has to be sent by email to: document@scaleway.com

We will update the email address on receipt of the application, subject to validation.

Once your email address has been updated, you can use the [lost password form](https://console.scaleway.com/forgot-password) to receive the recovery codes for your account.

## Password Security Guidelines

Besides the usual guidelines you should follow to create a complex password (must contain UPPERCASE and lowercase letters, symbols (`@`, `$`, `&`, ...) and numbers), some basic rules exist to keep your password - and your account - safe:

  - Never give your password to anyone. Especially not via mail, IRC, Slack, Whatsapp, or any messaging system. Scaleway employees will never ask you for your password.
  - Use [two-factor authentication](https://console.scaleway.com/account/profile) to add an extra layer of security.
  - Do not write down your password.
  - Always log out from your account at the end of each session, or if you are away from your computer.
