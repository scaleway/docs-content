Outsourcing a Dedibox server allows you to delegate the **technical management** of your dedicated server to another Scaleway Dedibox account, while keeping full ownership and control of your main account.

When you outsource a server:
- The recipient gains access to manage the server (e.g., monitor status, reboot, access console, etc.).
- They **cannot** view or modify billing information or services in your primary account.
- You retain full control over your account settings and subscriptions.

This feature is ideal for delegating server administration to IT teams, managed service providers, or technical partners—without compromising security or financial oversight.

<Requirements />

- An active Scaleway Dedibox account logged into the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net)
- At least one dedicated server
- The Scaleway console login (identifier) of the recipient account

  You can outsource multiple servers individually, even assigning each to a different technical contact if needed.

   The outsourcing form will appear.
4. Enter the **Scaleway console identifier** (login) of the recipient account.
   <Message type="note">
     The identifier is the Dedibox username the recipient uses to log in to their Dedibox account. It is **not** your own user ID.
     If can be found on the [outsourcing page](https://console.online.net/en/account/outsourcing/requests/) in the Dedibox console:

   </Message>
5. Click **Send request**.
   The recipient will receive a notification in their console and must **accept the request** to take over technical management.
   <Message type="info">
     You can track the status of your outsourcing requests on the [Outsourcing Requests page](https://console.online.net/en/account/outsourcing/requests/).
   </Message>

## After the request is accepted

Once accepted:
- The server appears in the recipient’s console under **Outsourced Servers**.
- They can perform technical actions such as:
  - Rebooting the server
  - Accessing the IPMI console
  - Monitoring hardware status
- You continue to manage billing and server ownership.

To revoke access, you can cancel the outsourcing at any time from the same menu.
