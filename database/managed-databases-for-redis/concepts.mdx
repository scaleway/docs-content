## Allowed IPs

Access control list (ACL) rules [define permissions for remote access to a Database Instance](/database/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/manage-allowed-ip-addresses/). A rule consists of an IP address or an IP range.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Endpoint

A point of connection to a database. The endpoint is associated with an IPv4 address and a port, and contains the information of whether the endpoint is read-write or not.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## High availability

Is an option that allows you to create a secondary server, with an up-to-date replica of the database. If the primary server fails for any reason, the secondary can take over requests, reducing downtime.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Database Instance

A Database Instance is made up of multiple (at least 1) dedicated compute nodes, and is running a single Database Engine. Exactly one database engine is running on each node.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Managed database

Compared to traditional database management, which requires customers to provision their infrastructure and resources to manage their databases, managed databases offer the user access to a Database Instance without setting up the hardware or configuring the software.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Region

A region is represented as a Geographical area such as France (Paris: `fr-par`), the Netherlands (Amsterdam: `nl-ams`) or Poland (Warsaw: `pl-waw`).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Cache 

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Cluster 

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Database for Redis™ Instance 

</Concept>

<Concept>

## In-memory Database 

A database management system primarily build upon memory. Data is managed and stored within the main memory of an Instance. This allows the optimization of request speed and the improvement of application performance. 

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Horizontal Scaling

Feature that allows you to increase the size of your Managed Database for Redis™ infrastructure by adding more nodes to your Database Instance to increase your number of endpoints and distribute cache. 

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Vertical Scaling  

Feature that allows you to increase the size of your Managed Database for Redis™ by upgrading to a bigger node type to allow increased traffic for the same endpoint. 

</Concept>

<Concept>

## ACKS  

The TCP Keepalive Timer feature provides a mechanism to identify dead connections. When a TCP connection on a routing device is idle for too long, the device sends a TCP keepalive packet to the peer with only the Acknowledgment (ACK) flag turned on.
