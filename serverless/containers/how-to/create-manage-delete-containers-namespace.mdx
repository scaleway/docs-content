This page shows you how to create and manage a Serverless Containers namespace. [Namespaces](/serverless/containers/concepts/#namespace) allow you to group your containers and share environment variables between them.

<Macro id="requirements" /><Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## Creating a Serverless Containers namespace

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The list of your containers namespaces displays.
2. Click **Create namespace**. If you have no existing Serverless Containers resources in your current Project, click **Deploy container**.
3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Enter a **name**, and optionally a **description** for your namespace. The name must only contain alphanumeric characters and dashes.
    - Choose a **region**, which is the geographical location in which your namespace will be deployed.
    - Enter any **environment variables** required for your namespace. Environment variables configured in a namespace will be available in all containers/apps within the same namespace. For each environment variable, click **+Add new variable** and enter the key / value pair.
    - Set secret environment variables (optional). **Secrets** are environment variables that are injected into your container and stored securely, but not displayed in the console after initial validation. Add a **key** and a **value**.
    - Verify the **estimated cost**.
4. Click **Create namespace only** to finish, or click **Create namespace and add container** if you want to [deploy a container](/serverless/containers/how-to/deploy-container/) next.

## Managing a Serverless Containers namespace

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The containers page displays.

2. Click the containers namespace you want to manage.

3. Click the **Namespace settings** tab. Here, you can view information about the region, registry endpoint and description of your namespace.

4. Add any additional environment variables you wish to add by clicking **+Add**, entering the key/value pair, and clicking **Save**.

5. Add **secrets** for your container. Secrets are environment variables which are injected into your container, but the values are not retained or displayed by Scaleway after initial validation.
