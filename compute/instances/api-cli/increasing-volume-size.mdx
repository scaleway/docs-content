<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
- A [Block Storage volume](/compute/instances/api-cli/creating-a-volume)


1. Inspect the volume and verify its name, size, and if the type is `b_ssd` by running the following request.
    ```
    curl -q -H "X-Auth-Token: $SECRET_KEY" -X GET https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/<REGION>/volumes/<VOLUME_ID>
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      Replace `REGION` with the geographical region of the Instance. This value can either be `fr-par-1`, `fr-par-2`, or  `fr-par-3` for Instances located in Paris, `nl-ams-1`, `nl-ams-2` or `nl-ams-3` for Instances located in Amsterdam, or `pl-waw-1`, `pl-waw-2`, or `pl-waw-3` for Instances located in Warsaw. Replace `VOLUME_ID` with the unique identifier of the volume, which can be found on the Scaleway console under **Instances** > **Volumes** > **More info** (for the selected volume).
    </Message>

    The following response should appear as an output:

    ```
    {"volume": {"creation_date": "2020-06-02T08:04:50.094118+00:00", "server": null, "id": "<VOLUME_ID>", "size": 25000000000, "name": "myAwesomeVolume", "zone": "<REGION>", "export_uri": null, "volume_type": "b_ssd", "modification_date": "2020-06-02T08:04:50.094118+00:00", "state": "available", "organization": "<ORGANIZATION_ID>"}}
    ```
2. To modify the volume size, run the request below:
    ```
    curl https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/REGION/volumes/VOLUME_ID -H "X-Auth-Token: $SECRET_KEY" -X PATCH -H 'Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8' --data '{ "name":"new_name", "size":26000000000 }'
    ```
  Replace `REGION` and `VOLUME_ID` following the guidelines mentioned previously and replace the existing size value with the new one.

  <Message type="note">
    You can use the same request to change the name of your volume by replacing `new_name` with another of your choice. If you do not wish to change the volume name, erase `"name":"new_name",` from the request before running it.
  </Message>

  A response appears confirming the changes:
  ```
  {"volume": {"creation_date": "2020-06-02T08:04:50.094118+00:00", "server": null, "id": "VOLUME_ID", "size": 26000000000, "name": "new_name", "zone": "REGION", "export_uri": null, "volume_type": "b_ssd", "modification_date": "2020-06-02T08:08:27.385208+00:00", "state": "resizing", "organization": "ORGANIZATION_ID"}}
  ```
