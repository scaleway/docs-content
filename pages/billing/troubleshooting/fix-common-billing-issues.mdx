## I cannot pay my invoice

### Cause
Your payment may have failed due to insufficient funds, an issue with your payment method, or incorrect SEPA mandate details.

### Solution
**If you are paying by credit card, try the following:**
 - Ensure you have enough funds in your bank account. 
 - If payment still does not work, the reason for the failure is indicated in the error message in the console
<Message type="tip">
  A `card_declined` error message means the payment was refused by your bank. Contact your bank for more details.
</Message>

**If you are paying via SEPA direct debit, try the following:**
- Verify that your SEPA mandate is correctly set up to ensure future payments are processed.
- Verify that your billing address matches the country of your bank account.
- Retry the payment.
<Message type="requirement">
  Unpaid invoices must be paid by credit card.
</Message>

## I did not receive my invoice

### Cause
Your invoice may not have been delivered due to an incorrect billing contact email or an issue with email delivery.

### Solution
**Verify your billing email address:**
- Check the [billing contact](/billing/faq/#how-can-i-add-a-billing-contact-to-my-account) section in your Scaleway console to ensure the email address is correct. 
- Check your spam or junk folder.
<Message type="tip">
  You can also [download the your invoices](/billing/how-to/download-an-invoice/) from the console.
</Message>

## I have no access to my invoices 

### Cause
Access to invoices is restricted based on your role and permissions within the Scaleway Organization. Only users with the necessary IAM rights can view the billing section.

### Solution
- [Check your permissions within your Organization](/iam/quickstart/#how-to-give-permissions-to-users-and-applications-via-policies): if you are not the owner of the Organization, ensure that you have the appropriate IAM rights to access the billing section.
- If you do not have the necessary permissions, ask the Organization owner for access.

## I deleted my resources but I still receive invoices

### Cause
Some resources may continue to generate charges even after deletion. Common reasons include:
- **Elastic Metal servers**: billing continues until the server is fully deleted. If the server is only powered off but not deleted, charges will still apply.
- **Flexible IP addresses**: reserved flexible IPs are billed even if they are not attached to an active resource.
- **Volumes and snapshots**: detached volumes or stored snapshots from deleted Instances may still incur storage charges.
- **Pro-rata billing**: Scaleway operates on a pay-as-you-go model, so you may receive an invoice for usage incurred before deletion, even if the resource was removed before the end of the billing cycle.

### Solution 
**Verify deleted resources:** 
- Check your Scaleway console to ensure that all associated resources (e.g., servers, IPs, volumes, snapshots) have been fully deleted.
- Review your billing details.
