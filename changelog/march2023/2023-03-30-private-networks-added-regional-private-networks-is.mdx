Regional Private Networks allow you to connect resources across multiple AZs within the same region and are currently only available in the PAR region. 

Create a dedicated, private, and flexible Layer 2 network to which you can attach Scaleway resources such as Instances, Load Balancers, Public Gateways, Elastic Metal, and Databases.
