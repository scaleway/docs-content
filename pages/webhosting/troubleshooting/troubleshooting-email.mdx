## Problem
You are experiencing issues with sending or receiving emails using your Web Hosting.

### Symptoms
- Emails are not being received or sent.
- Emails are landing in the spam folder instead of the inbox.
- Your mail server rejects outgoing emails.
- You receive bounce-back messages with error codes.

## Possible causes & solutions

### Incorrect IMAP/POP3 configuration
#### Cause
Your email client or application may have incorrect IMAP/POP3 settings, preventing emails from being received.

#### Solution
- Check your SMTP server address, port, and authentication method in your email client.
- Use the correct SMTP settings provided for your mailbox:
  - **Incoming mail Server:** `yourdomain.com` *(or as provided by the instructions in your hosting panel)*
  - **Port:** `993` (IMAP, recommended) or `995` (POP3)
  - **Authentication:** Enabled (use your email credentials)
- Ensure your firewall or ISP is not blocking any of these ports.

### Incorrect SMTP configuration
#### Cause
Your email client or application may have incorrect SMTP settings, preventing emails from being sent.

#### Solution
- Check your SMTP server address, port, and authentication method in your email client.
- Use the correct SMTP settings provided for your mailbox:
  - **SMTP Server:** `yourdomain.com` *(or as provided by the instructions in your hosting panel)*
  - **Port:** `465` (SSL)
  - **Authentication:** Enabled (use your email credentials)
- Ensure your firewall or ISP is not blocking outgoing SMTP connections.

### Missing or incorrect SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
#### Cause:
- If your domain lacks proper DNS records for email authentication, recipient mail servers may flag your emails as spam or reject them.

#### Solution
Update your DNS zone with the recommended settings for your Web Hosting plan from the ***DNS verification** tab in the Scaleway console.

### IP address blacklisted for spam activity
#### Cause
If your server's IP address has been flagged for sending spam, email providers may reject your messages.

#### Solution
- Check if your IP is blacklisted using [MXToolbox Blacklist Checker](https://mxtoolbox.com/blacklists.aspx).
- Scan your devices (desktop computers, laptops, mobile phones, etc.) for malware or compromised email accounts.
- If blacklisted, contact our [technical support](https://console.scaleway.com/support) for further assistance.
- *Optional:* Order a dedicated IP address in the Scaleway console, reserved for emails sent and received by domain names linked to your Web Hosting.
