## Problem

When using third party API or CLI tools such as the [AWS CLI](/storage/object/api-cli/object-storage-aws-cli/), MinIO Client or Rclone to manage your Object Storage resources, you may experience one of the following issues connecting to the Scaleway API or listing your resources:

- Listing your buckets with a third party tool returns nothing, but you have at least one bucket created in the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com/object-storage/buckets).

- The tool returns `An error occurred (Forbidden) when calling the ListObjectsV2 operation: Forbidden` or a similar message.

## Cause

The API key you used to configure the S3 third party tool has a [preferred project](/identity-and-access-management/iam/api-cli/using-api-key-object-storage/#the-impact-of-preferred-projects) assigned.
