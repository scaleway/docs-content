The Kubernetes autoheal feature is designed to automatically detect and recover from failures within a Kubernetes cluster.
It provides a proactive approach to maintaining the health and availability of nodes of the cluster by automatically addressing issues that may arise.
The autoheal feature periodically checks the health of the Kubernetes cluster and takes action based on predefined conditions.

You can enable the autoheal feature to ensure that your applications remain operational even in the event of failures. Some common use cases include:

- **Enhanced reliability**: By automatically recovering from failures, autoheal improves the reliability of nodes forming the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Fault tolerance**: It enhances the fault tolerance of the Kubernetes cluster by detecting and addressing issues such as pod crashes or node failures.
- **Reduced downtime**: By automatically detecting and recovering from failures, autoheal reduces downtime and minimizes the impact on application performance.
- **Operational efficiency**: It reduces the need for manual intervention in addressing failures, thereby improving operational efficiency.

## Autoheal process

Autoheal is triggered by the shoot-manager every five (5) minutes. If the shoot-manager sees a node in `notReady` status for more than 15 minutes, it will reboot it (once only), and after 30 minutes it will be replaced.

## When to enable or disable autoheal

### When to enable autoheal

Autoheal is advised to be enabled in production environments where maintaining high availability and minimizing downtime is critical.

### When to disable autoheal

There may be scenarios where autoheal should be disabled:

- **Testing environments**: In testing or development environments where failures can be tolerated for troubleshooting purposes.
- **Custom ranecovery mechanisms**: If custom recovery mechanisms are in place that handle failures more effectively than the autoheal feature.
