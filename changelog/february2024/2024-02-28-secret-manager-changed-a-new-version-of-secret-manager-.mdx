Scaleway Manager API now has a new version available: v1beta1.
This new version comes with major improvements:
- Improved resilience and scalability
- No more folder endpoints, but still the possibility to use paths to organize secrets
- Simplicity to change the path of a secret

Scaleway public console now uses this version for Secret Manager product pages. For more information, you can read the <Link to=https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/secret-manager/>API documentation website</Link>

Please note that the v1alpha1 API still is supported but will be eventually deprecated.
