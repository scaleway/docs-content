You can now subscribe directly to queues from your topics, from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com), and via the [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/) for standard and FIFO topics. 

For more information, refer to the [Subscriptions documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-subscriptions/).
