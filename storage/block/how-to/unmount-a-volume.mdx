It is important to unmount (detach) a device from the operating system using the `umount` command to avoid data loss before [removing the Block Storage volume](/storage/block/how-to/detach-a-volume/) from the machine. 

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) 
- You have [configured your SSH key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key)
- You have a [Instance](/compute/instances/concepts/#instance) with an additional Block Storage volume

</Message>

1. Connect to your Instance with `ssh`.
  ```
  ssh root@<your_instance_ip>
  ```

2. Unmount the volume to remove it from your current setup.
  ```
  root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# umount /mnt/block-volume
  ```

3.  Check that the volume is no longer mounted in the system with `lsblk`.
  ```
  root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# lsblk
  NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
  sda       8:0    0 23.3G  0 disk
  vda     252:0    0 18.6G  0 disk
  ├─vda1  252:1    0 18.5G  0 part /
  └─vda15 252:15   0  100M  0 part /boot/efi
  ```

  Do not forget to edit the `/etc/fstab` file and delete the line corresponding to your block volume.

If you want to mount the same volume elsewhere, make sure you change the mount point.
Refer to the [How to mount and use a block volume](/storage/block/how-to/mount-and-use-volume/) page for more information.
