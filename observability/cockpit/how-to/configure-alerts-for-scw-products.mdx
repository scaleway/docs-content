This page shows you how to configure managed alerts for Scaleway resources using the `Scaleway Metrics` data source.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
  - You have [activated your Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/how-to/activate-cockpit/)
  - You have created Scaleway resources to monitor
  - You have [created your Grafana credentials](/observability/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/) and selected the **Editor** role
  - You have [activated managed alerts and created at least one contact point](/observability/cockpit/how-to/activate-managed-alerts/)
</Message>

1. Click **Cockpit** in the Observability section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Cockpit** overview page displays.
2. Click **Open dashboards** at the top right corner of your screen. You are directed to Grafana.
3. Log in to Grafana using your credentials.
4. Click the **Toggle menu** then click **Alerting**.
5. Click **Alert rules** and **+ New alert rule**.
6. Scroll down to the **Define query and alert condition** section and click **Switch to data source-managed alert rule**.
    <Message type="note">
     This allows you to configure alert rules managed by the data source of your choice, instead of using Grafana's managed alert rules.
    </Message>
7. Type in the name for your alert.
8. Select the data source you want to configure alerts for. For the sake of this documentation we are choosing the **Scaleway Metrics** data source.
9. In the **Metrics browser** drop-down, select the metric you want to configure an alert for. For the sake of this documentation, we are choosing the `instance_server_cpu_seconds_total` metric.
10. Select labels that apply to the metric you have selected in the previous step, to target your desired resources and fine-tune your alert.
11. Select one or more values fo your labels.
12. Click **Use query** to generate your alert based on the conditions you have defined. For example, the alert below will be triggered whenever **the rate of our Instance's total CPU usage per second exceeds 10%**.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-instance-grafana-alert.webp" alt="" />
13. In the **Set alert evaluation behavior** field, configure the amount of time during which the alert can be in breach of the condition(s) you have defined, until it fires.
    <Message type="note">
     For example, if you wish to be alerted after your alert has been in breach of the condition for 2 minutes without interruption, type `2` and select `minutes` in the drop-down.
    </Message>
14. Enter a namespace for your alert in the **Namespace** field and click **Enter**.
15. Enter a name for your alert's group in the **Group** field and click **Enter**.
16. Optionally, add a summary and a description.
17. Click **Save rule** at the top right corner of your screen to save your alert. Once your alert meets the requirements you have configured, you will receive an email to inform you that your alert is firing.

 You can configure up to a maximum of 10 alerts for the `Scaleway Metrics` data source.
