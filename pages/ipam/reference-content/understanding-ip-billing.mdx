This document aims to help you understand how Scaleway bills **public** and **private** IP addresses.

## Public IP addresses - flexible IPs

Public connectivity for **Instances**, **Elastic Metal**, **Load Balancers** and **Public Gateways** is facilitated by a [flexible IP address](/ipam/reference-content/public-connectivity-best-practices/#flexible-ip-addresses-definition). A flexible IP address is a public IP address that you can attach and detach from the resource at will.

- Flexible IP addresses are billed separately to the resources they are attached to.
- Hourly rates for different types of flexible IP addresses can be found on the [Scaleway pricing page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/network/#additional-ip). Note that while flexible IPv4 addresses are generally billable, flexible IPv6 addresses are often free.
- Hourly billing for a flexible IP begins when you reserve it and ends when you delete it from your account. It is billed even if it is not attached to a resource.
- Prices are rounded to a minimum amount of €0.01 on a per-IP basis. This means that if you keep a given flexible IP for only a short duration (less than a day), its billing may be higher than you expect. See example below.

**Rounding of hourly billing for flexible IP addresses**
<br />
The following scenario exemplifies the rounding used.
Note that you should always check the [Scaleway pricing page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/network/#additional-ip) for the most up-to-date hourly rates.
<br />
- A flexible IPv4 address is billed, for example, at €0.004 per hour
- You create **three** flexible IP addresses at 3pm and delete them all **1 hour** later at 4pm
- Cost incurred per IP address is therefore `0.0004 x 1 = €0.0004`
- As this does not meet the minimum billable amount of €0.01, the cost for each IP is rounded to `€0.01`
- You will therefore be charged `3 x 0.01 = €0.03`

## Other types of public IP

Depending on the resource type, it may have possibilities for other types of public IP other than a flexible IP. Billing will therefore be different: many of these types of IP are free (e.g. public endpoints for Managed Databases).

For the most up-to-date information on hourly rates, always check the [pricing page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/) or the **Estimated cost calculator** that displays in the Scaleway console whenever you create a resource.

## Private IP addresses

Whenever you attach a resource to a [Private Network](/vpc/how-to/attach-resources-to-pn/), it gets a private IPv4 and/or IPv6 address on that network.

Private IP addresses at Scaleway are always free of charge. This applies to both auto-allocated and [IPAM-reserved](/ipam/how-to/reserve-ip/) private IPs.
