Powering off your Instance shuts it down by transferring all the data on the Instance's local volume to a volume store. The physical node is released back to the pool of available machines. If the Instance has a flexible IP, it will remain available in your account.

  - Before powering off your Instance, shut down the OS by logging into your Instance as root and executing the halt command.
  - Powering off may take some time, depending on the amount of data in the Instanceâ€™s local volume.
