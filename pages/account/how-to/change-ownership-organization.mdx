At Scaleway, each Organization can have only one Owner, who is usually the person who created the account.
For several reasons, such as the departure of an employee or enterprise acquisition, you may need to change the Owner of your Organization, transferring the title to another person.

While there is no process for transferring an Organization between accounts or attributing the Owner role to another Member, you do have some options to allow someone else to access the Organization as an Owner. This page shows you how to do so.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- Be the [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) of the intended Organization

<Message type="important">
  - You cannot have more than one Owner per Organization.
  - It is not possible to be the Owner of more than one Scaleway Organization using the same email address.
  - If the Owner of your Organization is an employee of your company who will be leaving soon, we recommend replacing their email with that of the new Owner before their departure.
</Message>

The process of changing the Owner of an Organization varies, depending on whether you have access to the Owner's account.

## I have access to the Owner account

1. Open the [Settings page](https://console.scaleway.com/settings/organization) of your Organization on the Scaleway console. You can find this option on the left-side navigation menu.
  Alternatively, click your **Profile avatar** on the right side of the header navigation, then click **Settings**. On the left-side navigation menu, scroll down to the **Account** section, and click **User information**.
2. Go to the [User information](https://console.scaleway.com/settings/account/profile#profile-information) section of your Owner's **Profile** page and click **Edit**. A pop-up appears.
3. Replace the current email address with that of the desired new Owner in the **email address** field.
  You can also change the first and last names to those of the new Owner, if you wish.
    <Message type="important">
      - It is not possible to be the Owner of more than one Scaleway Organization using the same email.
      - If the person you want to transfer ownership to has an Organization of their own, they will have to either create a new email address or delete their personal Organization before you make the update.
    </Message>
4. Click **Confirm** changes to save your modification(s).

  The Owner account is now registered under the newly entered email address.

### Ownership transition
Ensure you communicate the current password to the new Owner and [disable MFA](/account/how-to/use-2fa/#how-to-disable-mfa), if enabled. This lets them easily access the Owner account, and they can re-enable multifactor authentication on their personal device later on.

If the old Owner must still have access to the Organization, you can [create a Member account](/iam/how-to/manage-members/#how-to-create-a-member) using their email address.
Then, using permission sets, you can grant them rights to view, edit, and manage resources within the Organization. [Learn more about permission sets](/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/#scoped-by-project)

## I have no access to the Owner account

If you need to change the Owner information of an Organization but have no access to their account, you must [reach out to our Support team via a ticket](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create) and provide them with the following information:

- Organization ID
- Current Organization Owner's first and last name
- Current Organization Owner's email address
- New Organization Owner's first and last name
- New Organization Owner's email address
  If the Organization is a Corporate account, you must also attach a copy of the company's **Kbis/registration**.
