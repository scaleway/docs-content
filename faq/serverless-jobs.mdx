## What are Serverless Jobs?

Scaleway Serverless Jobs is a fully managed service that enables efficient execution of batch computing workloads. It automates management tasks, allowing users to run large-scale batch jobs with ease.

## How am I billed for Serverless Jobs?

### Principles

Serverless Jobs are billed on a pay-as-you-go basis, strictly on resource consumption (Memory and CPU).

* **Memory consumption:** The memory consumption is obtained by multiplying the memory tier chosen by the job run duration.
* **vCPU consumption:** The vCPU consumption is obtained by multiplying the vCPU tier chosen by the job run duration.
* **Ephemeral storage:** Is free of charge, the maximum value of ephemeral storage depends on the memory value.

### Prices

* **Memory consumption:** €0.10 per 100 000 GB-s, and we provide a **400 000 GB-s free tier** per account and per month.

    | Memory   | Price per second  |
    |--------- |------------------ |
    | 128 MB   | €0.000000125      |
    | 256 MB   | €0.00000025       |
    | 512 MB   | €0.0000005        |
    | 1024 MB  | €0.000001         |
    | 2048 MB  | €0.000002         |
    | 3072 MB  | €0.000003         |
    | 4096 MB  | €0.000004         |

* **vCPU consumption:** €1.00 per 100 000 vCPU-s, and we provide a **200 000 vCPU-s free tier** per account per month.

    | CPU         | Price per second  |
    |------------ |------------------ |
    | 0.07 vCPU   | €0.0000007        |
    | 0.14 vCPU   | €0.0000014        |
    | 0.28 vCPU   | €0.0000028        |
    | 0.56 vCPU   | €0.0000056        |
    | 1.12 vCPU   | €0.0000112        |

### Example

| Criteria                   | Value            |
|--------------------------- |------------------|
| Monthly duration           | 432 000 s (120h) |
| Amount of memory allocated | 2048 MB          |
| Amount of vCPU allocated   | 1120 mVCPU       |
| Free tier                  | Yes              |

#### Price calculation

* **Memory consumption**
    * *Allocated Memory conversion:* 2048 MB = 2 GB
    * *Resource consumption:* 432 000 s * 2 GB = 864 000 GB-s
    * *Free tier:* 400 000 GB-s
    * *Billed resources:* 864 000 - 400 000 = 464 000 GB-s
    * *Cost:* 464 000 * €0.0000010 = **€0.47**
* **vCPU consumption**
    * *Allocated vCPU conversion:* 1120 mVCPU = 1.12 vCPU
    * *Resource consumption:* 432 000 s * 1.12 vCPU =  483 840 vCPU-s
    * *Free tier:* 200 000 vCPU-s
    * *Billed resources:* 483 840 - 200 000 = 283 840 vCPU-s
    * *Cost:* 283 840 * €0.0000100 = **€2.84**

**Monthly Cost: €3,31**

## What types of workloads are best suited for Serverless Jobs?

Serverless Jobs is ideal for tasks such as data processing, analysis and various computational operations that can be executed in a non-interactive batch mode. You can execute short and long-running jobs.

## How can I monitor the activity of my Serverless Jobs?

Serverless Jobs are integrated with [Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/quickstart/), Scaleway's Observability service. Cockpit allows you to [see all the logs and metrics associated with your job runs](/serverless/jobs/concepts/#job-run). Additionally, each job run has a status that provides you with real-time information on your job's execution.

## Can I cancel or modify a Serverless Job after it has started?

An ongoing Serverless Job can be interrupted during its execution from the **Job runs** section of a job's **Overview** tab. Refer to the [dedicated docmentation](/serverless/jobs/how-to/stop-job/) for more information.

## How can I automate the deployment and management of Scaleway Serverless Jobs?

Scaleway Serverless Jobs is part of the Scaleway ecosystem, it can therefore be driven using the [Scaleway CLI](/developer-tools/scaleway-cli/quickstart/), the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/), and other [developer tools](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/). Our serverless ecosystem offers a lot of possibilities with event-driven architectures, and integrations with more products of the Scaleway ecosystem are under active development.

## Can I run multiple Serverless Jobs at the same time?

When starting a job, you can use contextual options to define the number of jobs to execute at the same time. Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/serverless/jobs/how-to/run-job/#how-to-run-a-job-with-contextual-options) for more information.

## Where should I host my jobs images for deployment ?

<Macro id="container-registry-note" />

## How can I copy an image from an external registry to Scaleway Container Registry?

You can copy an image from an external registry by [logging in to the Scaleway Container Registry](/containers/container-registry/how-to/connect-docker-cli/) using the Docker CLI, and by copying the image as shown below:

```sh
docker pull alpine:latest
docker tag alpine:latest rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/example/alpine:latest
docker push rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/example/alpine:latest
```

Alternatively, you can use tools such as [Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo) to copy the image:

```sh
skopeo login rg.fr-par.scw.cloud -u nologin -p $SCW_SECRET_KEY
skopeo copy --override-os linux docker://docker.io/alpine:latest docker://rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/example/alpine:latest
```

## How can I configure access to a Private Network?

Scaleway Serverless Jobs does not currently support Scaleway VPC or Private Networks, though this feature is under development.

To add network restrictions on your resource, consult the [list of prefixes used at Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/en/peering/). Serverless resources do not have dedicated or predictable IP addresses.

## Can I securely use sensitive information with Serverless Jobs?

Yes, you can use sensitive data such as API secret keys, passwords, TLS/SSL certificates, or tokens. Serverless Jobs seamlessly integrates with [Secret Manager](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/), which allows you to securely reference sensitive information within your jobs. Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/serverless/jobs/how-to/reference-secret-in-job/) for more information.
