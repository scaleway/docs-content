This page shows how to get started with Scaleway Messaging and Queuing. The process differs depending on the [messaging protocol](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#messaging-protocol) you want to use:

- For NATS, you need to **create a NATS account**.
- For SQS or SNS, you need to **activate the protocol**.

Both procedures are described in full below.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to create a NATS account

To start using a NATS message broker, you must first create a NATS account. This sets a scope for your NATS credentials, messages, queues and stream.

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The following screen displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-activate-mandq.webp" alt="" />

2. Select a [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) from the drop-down menu. The region designates the geographical area where the NATS account will be hosted.

3. Click **NATS**. The NATS welcome screen displays.

4. Click **Create a NATS account**. The creation wizard displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-nats-account.webp" alt="" />

5. Complete the following steps in the wizard:

    - Check the **region**, which is the geographical location in which your NATS account will be created. If you want to use a different region to the one shown, go back to step 2 to change it.
    - Enter a **name** for your NATS account, or use the auto-generated name suggested for you.
    - Optional: Use the *Estimated cost** calculator to simulate how messages sent and stored with NATS streams will be billed. Note that simply creating a NATS account does not in itself incur any billing. For more information about NATS billing, see the [FAQ](/faq/messaging-and-queuing/#how-is-messaging-and-queuing-billed).
    - Click **Create NATS account** to finish.

    You are directed to the listing of your NATS accounts, where your newly-created NATS account now appears.

    <Message type="tip">
    You can create more NATS accounts in your pre-selected region if you wish, by clicking on the `+ Create NATS account` button. To create NATS accounts in other regions, repeat the steps above starting from step 2 and selecting the required region.
    </Message>


## How to activate SQS or SNS

SQS and SNS are handled as two separate protocols. Each one needs to be activated before you can start creating credentials, queues, topics, etc. for this protocol. You can choose to activate one or both protocols as you like. You can deactivate each protocol at any time.

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The following screen displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-activate-mandq.webp" alt="" />

2. Select a [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) from the drop-down menu. The region designates the geographical area where the service will be hosted.

3. Click **Activate** next to SQS or SNS, depending on the protocol you want to activate.

    A message displays prompting you to click a button to activate the protocol. It also reminds you that activating the protocol does not trigger any billing, and that you can deactivate at any time.

4. Click **Activate SQS** (or SNS).

    The protocol is activated for the selected region, and you are invited to [generate credentials](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-credentials/). You can repeat these steps to activate the protocol for additional regions, if required.
