An Instance is a virtual machine in the cloud. Scaleway supports several [types of Instances](/compute/instances/reference-content/choosing-instance-type), each with their own set of resources, unique value propositions, and technical specifications. Each Instance supports the essential operating systems and distributions, as well as customized [Instantapps](/compute/instances/concepts/#instantapp).

## Learning range: Stardust Instances

Scaleway's **Learning** range includes our Stardust Instances. Stardust Instances are the perfect Instances for small workloads and simple applications. They are built to host small internal applications, staging environments or low-traffic web servers.
