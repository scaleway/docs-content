Whenever your Database Instance volume is close to reaching full capacity, your Database Instance switches to `disk_full` mode.

The Database Instance switches to `disk_full` mode when the free space falls under 2% of the total volume size.

For Database Instances where 2% of the volume size is more than 2 GB, this threshold is 2 GB.

This state allows you to increase your volume, if you use Block Storage, or [upgrade your node type](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/upgrade-a-database/). You can also clear some space in your volume to increase your capacity.

When the Database Instance switches to `disk_full` state, the default transaction mode automatically switches to `read only`. This allows your applications to still access its data, while preventing new data from being added.

  The Database Instance disk space includes database engine logs.

You can check your current engine logs consumption by using the Scaleway CLI:

```
scw rdb log list-details instance-id=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
Details.0.LogName   postgresql-01.log
Details.0.Size      64257
Details.1.LogName   postgresql-02.log
Details.1.Size      81560
...
```

You have the possibility to purge a single file or all the log files:

```
# Purge a single file
scw rdb log purge instance-id=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111 log-name=postgresql-01.log

# Purge all your logs
scw rdb log purge instance-id=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
```

## How to clear out space used by your Database engine

1. [Connect to your Database Instance](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/connect-database-instance).
2. Run the following commands to shift to a `read write` transaction:
    ```sql
    -- On PostgreSQL
    BEGIN;
    SET TRANSACTION READ WRITE;
    ```

    ```sql
    -- On MySQL
    SET transaction_read_only=0;
    BEGIN;
    ```
3. Clear out data from your database.
4. Commit your changes.
    ```
    COMMIT;
    ```

When your Database Instance has enough space again, the default transaction mode changes back to `read write`, allowing operations to return to normal.

  Failing to clear out some of your data or forcing insertions while the database is in `disk_full` mode leads to downtime.
