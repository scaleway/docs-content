Your Dedibox server includes a remote reboot system, which we show you how to use in this document.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net/)
- [Created](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/order-a-server) and [installed](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/install-a-server) a dedicated server

1. From the console, click **Server** > **Server list**. A list of your servers displays.
2. Click **Manage** next to the server you want to restart.
3. Click the **Reboot** button on the right. A pop-up asks if you are sure you want to reboot.
4. Click **I accept** to confirm the reboot.

    You are returned to your main server page, where you see the message **Reboot in progress**.

<Message type="tip">
  - You can also reboot your server via [KVM](/dedibox/kvm-over-ip/). In the iDRAC and iLO KVM interfaces, you can switch your server OFF and ON again. This allows you to check what happens during its boot sequence and intervene if necessary.
  - If it stops responding, you can try [rebooting your server in Rescue Mode](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/use-rescue-mode/). In the case the problem persists, [open a support ticket](https://console.online.net/en/assistance/ticket/) to ask for a hardware check of your server.
