You can view metrics for your NATS services via [Scaleway Cockpit](/cockpit/quickstart/). This allows you to monitor your queues/streams and messages at a glance. There are two steps to complete to view your metrics for the first time with Cockpit:

1. Generate your Grafana credentials
2. Access the product's metrics dashboard

These steps are described below.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- At least one [NATS account](/nats/how-to/create-account/)

<CockpitIamPermissions />

## How to access your NATS dashboard and view your metrics

1. Click **NATS** in the **Data and Analytics** section of the Scaleway console side menu.

2. Use the drop-down menu to select the [region](/nats/concepts/#region) of the NATS account you want to view metrics for.

3. Click the NATS account whose metrics you want to view.

4. Click the **Metrics** tab.

5. Click **Open Grafana metrics dashboard**.

6. Log in to Grafana.

    You are directed to the NATS dashboard, where you can view all your metrics.
