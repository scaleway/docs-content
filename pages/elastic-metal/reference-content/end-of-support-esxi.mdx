Following Broadcom's acquisition of VMware and the subsequent change in its licensing policy, Broadcom has discontinued the general availability of its free vSphere Hypervisor (ESXi).
As a result, we have removed this image from automatic installation on our Elastic Metal and Dedibox servers.

This change does not affect servers currently running ESXi images. However, it will no longer be possible to reinstall ESXi on existing Elastic Metal or Dedibox servers or install it on new servers using Scaleway-provided ESXi images.

  For more information about Broadcom's decision to retire the vSphere Free Edition images, refer to their official knowledge base article: [End Of General Availability of the free vSphere Hypervisor (ESXi 7.x and 8.x)](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?legacyId=2107518).

You may still be able to install ESXi on Elastic Metal or Dedibox servers using the [KVM-over-IP](/dedibox-kvm-over-ip/quickstart/) system. However, note that we cannot provide support for its configuration or operation.

For the best experience, we recommend using one of the officially supported hypervisors:

- [Proxmox VE](/tutorials/configure-failover-proxmox/)
- [Microsoft Hyper-V](/tutorials/configure-vm-hyperv/)
