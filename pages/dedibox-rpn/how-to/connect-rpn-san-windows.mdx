[RPN SAN](/dedibox-rpn/concepts/#rpn-san) is an iSCSI target that can be mounted on Windows Server 2012 and later, including Windows Server 2019 and 2022, enabling it to operate as a standard disk within the system.

<Requirements />

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- A [Dedibox dedicated server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox)
- An [RPN SAN](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/storage/)

1. Launch the **Server Manager** application of Windows and click **Tools** > **iSCSI Initiator**.

2. Click the **Discovery** tab to add the SAN server:

  <Message type="tip">
    The initiator is not activated by the default on the system start. If you start it for the first time, you are asked if you want to start it during the system start. Click **yes** to confirm.

3. Click the **Targets** tab and select the target you want to connect to. Click **Connection** to confirm. The target will then be connected to the server as an unformatted disk.

4. Launch the control panel and click **System and Security** > **Create and format hard disk partitions** in the **Administrative Tools** section.

5. The disk can be configured from the **Storage** > **Disk Management** section of the **Computer Management** tool. By default, it displays as offline.

6. Right-click on it and click **Online** to activate the disk. The system will propose the type of partition table to use for your disk.

  <Message type="tip">
    For a 1 TB SAN, keep the default choice. If you have a larger SAN, select GPT, Windows can not handle partitions larger than 2 TB with anything except GPT.
  </Message>
7. Format the disk with a file system (NTFS). Click **Next** > **Finish** to confirm formatting the disk.

    Once finished formatting (in about 10 minutes using quick formatting), the hard disk drive should be accessible from the server manager as a regular disk:
