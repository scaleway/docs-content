This page shows you how to configure your sending domain to start sending [transactional emails](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#transactional-email).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A domain name

1. Click **Transactional Email** in the **Managed Services** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Transactional Email** overview page displays.
2. Click **Add domain**.
3. Enter the domain name you want to use with Transactional Email.
4. Click **Validate domain name** to confirm.

<Message type="important">
 You need to configure your [SPF](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#spf-record), [DKIM](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#dkim-record) and [MX](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#mx-record) records to verify your domain and to be able to send emails.
