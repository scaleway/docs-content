import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## Problem

An error message similar to one of the following displays:

- `Error: S3 error: Too Many Requests`
- `Code: Too Many Requests`
- `Shared memory connection was closed.`
- `Agent failed to process method {DataTransfer.SyncDisk}.`

## Cause

Scaleway Object Storage applies a rate limit on PUT operations for safety reasons.

## Solution

Reduce the number of PUT operations sent by your deployment.

<Message type="note">
You may experience reduced throughput due to the limitation.
</Message>

### Going further

Refer to the documentation on [optimizing your Object Storage deployment](/object-storage/reference-content/optimize-object-storage-performance/).

If you did not manage to identify the error and solve it by yourself, [open a support ticket](/account/how-to/open-a-support-ticket/), and provide as many details as possible, along with the necessary information below:

- Object Storage Endpoint (e.g. `s3.fr-par.scw.cloud`)
- Bucket name
- Object name (if the request concerns an object)
- Request type (PUT, GET, etc.)
- HTTP status code
- Date and time (timestamp)
- User-agent (SDK, client, console, etc.)
- Transaction ID (if possible)
- Log / trace of the error (if possible)
