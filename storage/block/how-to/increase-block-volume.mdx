With Block Storage it is possible to expand the volume size of an instance.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com/) 
- You have [created](/storage/block/how-to/create-a-volume/) a Block Storage volume

</Message>

## How to increase the volume size from the Scaleway console

1. Click the **Volumes** tab on the Instance information page of the console. A list of your volumes displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> beside the volume you wish to increase and then click **Increase Volume**.
3. Increase the size according to your preference with the <Icon name="plus" /> button.

4. Click **Increase your Volume** to confirm.
  <Message type="note">

  Currently, only the **increase** of a Block Storage volume is supported. The maximum size of a Block volume is 10 TB.

## How to increase the partition size of the volume

<Message type="tip">

It is recommeneded to make a backup of your data using the [Snapshot](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/instances/how-to/create-a-snapshot/) feature, before increasing the partition size of your volume. This helps to avoid any data loss. 

</Message>


1. Connect to your Instance using [SSH](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/)

2. Use the `lsblk` command to identify your Block Storage volume's mount point. In the following example the volume is mounted at `/mnt/block-volume`: 

  ```
  root@scw-elegant-franklin:~# lsblk
  NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
  loop0     7:0    0 55.4M  1 loop /snap/core18/2128
  loop1     7:1    0 70.3M  1 loop /snap/lxd/21029
  loop2     7:2    0 32.3M  1 loop /snap/snapd/12704
  sda       8:0    0   28G  0 disk /mnt/block-volume
  vda     252:0    0 18.6G  0 disk
  ├─vda1  252:1    0 18.5G  0 part /
  ├─vda14 252:14   0    4M  0 part
  └─vda15 252:15   0  106M  0 part /boot/efi
  ```

3. [Unmount](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/storage/block/how-to/unmount-a-volume/) the volume:

  ```
  umount /mnt/block-volume
  ```

4. Check that the volume is unmounted by running the `lsblk` command. 

5. Increase the partition size of the volume using `resize2fs`. Replace `/dev/sdX` with the name of your block volume in the following command:

  ```
  resize2fs /dev/sdX
  ```

6. Run `e2fsck` on the Block Storage volume to check that everything went well. Replace `/dev/sdX` with the name of your block volume in the following command:

  ```
  e2fsck /dev/sdX
  ```

  An output like the following example displays. The status of your file system should be `clean`

  ```
  root@scw-elegant-franklin:~# e2fsck /dev/sda
  e2fsck 1.45.5 (07-Jan-2020)
  /dev/sda: clean, 11/1827840 files, 158770/7324218 blocks
  ```

7. [Remount](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/storage/block/how-to/mount-and-use-volume/) the volume to access the files stored on it: 

  ```
  mount -o defaults /dev/sda /mnt/block-volume
  ```
