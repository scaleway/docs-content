<Message type="important">
  Docker and CRI-O container runtimes [are no longer available](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/changelog/?a=kubernetes-05cf9bcf-5681).
</Message>

A container runtime is a software that manages the starting and stopping of containers, among other tasks. It is a fundamental component of Kubernetes. Initially, Docker was used as the container runtime for Kubernetes. However, as container runtimes continued to evolve rapidly, it became apparent that Docker was not the best choice. Other solutions emerged as more suitable alternatives.
The Container Runtime Interface (CRI) was developed as a means to open up Kubernetes to other container runtimes. CRI is a plugin within a Kubernetes cluster that allows the `kubelet` to use more than one type of container runtime. It consists of a protocol buffer and a gRPC API, as well as libraries, with additional specifications and tools.
At Scaleway, we favor `containerd`, the industry-leading CRI solution. [Containerd](https://containerd.io/) was initially developed by Docker and donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). It uses a subset of the original Docker engine and comes with most of Docker's functionalities for running containers and managing storage and images - but lacks many developer-oriented features. It is, therefore, suitable for large-scale use as part of a container orchestrator, such as Kubernetes.

  With Kubernetes version 1.25, Scaleway **Kubernetes Kapsule** will deprecate all Kubernetes interfaces named `docker` and `cri-o`.
</Message>

If you are still using one of the deprecated CRIs, your cluster will have the following limitations:
* Pools using deprecated CRIs cannot scale up.
* Control planes cannot be upgraded if the CRI used by a pool is deprecated.

To migrate your node pools to a supported CRI, you have to create a new resource pool supporting `containerd`, move your pods to the new pool and then delete your old pool.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster) a Kubernetes Kapsule cluster
</Message>

## How to move your pods to a new pool

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Kubernetes Kapsule dashboard displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the cluster you want to edit and click **More info** to find detailed information about the cluster.
3. Click the **Pools** tab to view the node pools associated with your cluster. 
    <Message type="tip">
      Any node pool using `docker` or `cri-o` runtimes is deprecated.
    </Message>
4. Click **+ Add pool**. The pool creation wizard displays.
5. Configure your new node pool:
    * Select a zone for your pool. The zone of your pool must match the zone your cluster is deployed in.
    * Select the node type to be used for your pool.
    * Configure pool options, such as **autoscaling** and **autohealing**.
    * Click **Add pool** to create a new pool and add it to your cluster.
6. Use the `kubectl get nodes` command to retrieve a list of your nodes.
7. Mark the nodes of your old pool as unschedulable using the [`kubectl cordon`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#cordon) command: 
    ```
    kubectl cordon <old_node_1>
    kubectl cordon <old_node_2>
    ...
    ```
    <Message type="important">
      If you have used **local storage** on your old nodes, data must **be copied** manually before moving pods and deleting nodes.
    </Message>
8. Empty the nodes using the [`kubectl drain`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#drain) command:
    ```
    kubectl drain <old_node_1>
    kubectl drain <old_node_2>
    ...
    ```
    Your old nodes will be emptied, and the pods will be recreated in the new pool.
9. Delete your old pool by clicking on <Icon name="more" /> > **Delete** next to the pool's name once all your pods are up again.
