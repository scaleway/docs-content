Scaleway Serverless Containers can be used in endless use cases:
- Push directly your containers to production hosting
- Automation
- Integration with your ecosystem
- CI/CD integration for automatic app deployment
- Optimizing applications with scaling from zero and to zero
- Manage workloads, and more.

For better understanding of Serverless Containers, we provide real world examples in our [serverless-examples repository](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-examples).

Here are some specific cases:
