## How to create a database

1. Click **SQL Databases** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The Serverless SQL Databases page displays.

2. Click **+ Create database**. The database creation wizard displays.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:

    - Choose a **region**, which is the geographical location in which your database will be created.

    - Select a **default engine version** from the drop-down menu.

    - Configure your **database autoscaling**. Your database will scale within the defined range to match the incoming load.
