Scaleway Serverless Jobs allows you to run recurring tasks in the cloud. A [Job](/serverless/jobs/concepts/#job) is based on a job definition, which is used as a template to create job runs.

Jobs are designed for autonomous and recurring tasks, and therefore do not offer automatic scaling or a web interface.

Refer to the [differences between Jobs, Containers, and Functions](/serverless/containers/reference-content/difference-jobs-functions-containers/) for more information on Scaleway's different Serverless products.

This page explains how to create a job definition with the latest Alpine Linux image, how to execute it, and delete it.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a Container Registry namespace](/containers/container-registry/how-to/create-namespace/) and [pushed a container image](/containers/container-registry/how-to/push-images/) to it

## How to create a job definition
