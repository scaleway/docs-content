All user accounts are [Organizations](/console/my-account/concepts#organization). When you [create a Scaleway Elements account](/console/my-account/how-to/create-an-account), you are the [Owner](/console/my-account/concepts#owner) of your Organization. If you are invited to a pre-existing Organization, you will simultaneously be the Owner of your own Organization and whatever role defined by the Owner or [Administrator](/console/my-account/concepts#administrator) who sent you the invitation.

When invited to join an Organization, you receive an invitation e-mail. 

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have been invited to join an [Organization](/console/my-project/concepts/#organization)

</Message>

1. Click **Accept Invitation** from your invitation e-mail. The Scaleway console opens in a browser window. A pop-up displays introducing you to the Organization.

2. Click **Next** to proceed. The Organization dashboard displays. 

  Optionally, you can activate your personal Organization:

3. Click the Organization name in the Organization menu.

  <Message type="note">

  The Organization name is identical to the account Owner. 
  If the account was created without the Owner's name, 
  it will be the prefix of the e-mail used to create the account. 
  For example, if the e-mail used is `myemail@example.com`, 
  the Organization name will be `myemail`. In this case, 
  the Organization name can be set to the account owners name, but only once.

  </Message>

  A message displays asking you to **Check your e-mail**.

4. Check your e-mail and click **Verify**

5. Click **I Agree to the Terms of Service and Scaleway's Data Protection Agreement** to confirm.

The Scaleway console opens in the browser. Follow [these steps] to complete your registration. 

## How to retrieve your Organization ID

Our system attributes an organization ID to each user. The Organization ID can be found on the [Organization Account page](https://console.scaleway.com/account/organization/profile) under **Organization Information**.
