## Problem

My function consumes an excessive amount of memory (RAM).

## Possible cause
	
With [Sandbox v2](/serverless-functions/reference-content/functions-sandbox/), the memory usage of a function is proportional to the number of forked subprocesses.

## Solutions

If your application relies on multiple subprocesses that instantiate numerous objects (such as large module imports in Python), we recommend using [Sandbox v1](/serverless-functions/reference-content/functions-sandbox/).

Refer to the [My function runs out of memory (OOM)](/serverless-functions/troubleshooting/function-oom/) documentation for other solutions for memory issues.
