## What is the difference between the Standard class in PAR and AMS, and the Standard class in WAW?
In the Paris (PAR) and Amsterdam (AMS) [regions](storage/object/concepts/#region-and-availability-zone), Scaleway Object Storage secures your data by distributing it across three different [Availability Zones (AZ)](storage/object/concepts/#region-and-availability-zone). In the event of a complete datacenter failure in an AZ, we are still able to rebuild your data and make it accessible. This is the system we call Multi-AZ (one datacenter per AZ, three AZs per region).

The standard class in Warsaw (WAW) currently allows you to store data across only one AZ.

## What happens when Multi-AZ is launched in a region?

When Multi-AZ is launched in a region, all existing objects are converted to the One Zone - IA class, which is equivalent to the old `Standard` class.

New objects created after the Multi-AZ launch can have the `Standard (Multi-AZ)`, `One Zone - IA`, or the `Glacier` class assigned.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## What is the new storage class One Zone - Infrequent Access (IA)?
With One Zone - IA, your data is across three different racks inside the same datacenter. This storage class is a good choice for storing secondary backup copies or easily recreatable data. 
It can also be integrated into your lifecycle management rules, along with Standard and Glacier classes.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Will these new storage classes affect how I use my buckets?
No, any objects you upload into your buckets are added as Standard class objects by default, just as before. If you want to transfer your objects to One Zone - IA or Glacier you can do so manually or set up [lifecycle rules](/storage/object/api-cli/lifecycle-rules-api/). 

</Concept>

<Concept>

## I do not want to use the new Standard class but I have a bucket and objects in PAR or AMS. Can I still use the old class?
Unfortunately, you cannot use the old Standard class. You must use the [One Zone - IA class](/storage/object/concepts/#storage-class).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Can I create a lifecycle rule to restore objects from Glacier class to One Zone - IA?
No, because restoring an object can only be done from Glacier to Standard class. Transition lifecycle rules can only be configured in the "top-down" direction. 

This means that you can transfer objects from Standard class to One Zone - IA and Glacier, but not from the last two to Standard. You can transfer objects from One Zone - IA to Glacier, but not restore objects from Glacier to One Zone - IA. The same applies when you make server-side copies.

## Do the new storage classes impact Scaleway Glacier?
No, the rules for using Glacier class remain the same and your data is still hosted in DC4.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Can I migrate my existing data to the new Multi-AZ Standard class?
Yes, you simply need to [edit the storage class](/storage/object/how-to/edit-storage-class/) of your objects. 

</Concept>

## I have a general question about Object Storage. Where can I find further answers?
You can find answers to your questions about the Object Storage service in our [Object Storage FAQ](/faq/objectstorage/).
