## Dedibox and Scaleway account unification

### What is account unification?
Account unification is the process of combining the sign-up, login, and settings of both Scaleway and Dedibox accounts, making it easier for you to access and manage the respective consoles.

### Why are you unifying Dedibox and Scaleway accounts?
The goal of the unification is to streamline account management for both accounts, offering you a simpler, more centralized experience and more security feature options.

From now on, when creating a [Scaleway](https://account.scaleway.com/login?service=elements) account, you will have access to [Dedibox](https://account.scaleway.com/login?service=dedibox) and vice versa. This means you have fewer credentials to manage and remember, and a more familiar environment to use.

### What exactly will change for existing customers with unification?
Account unification will change the following aspects:
- **Sign up**: Instead of having to create one Dedibox and one Scaleway account individually, you will now have a single creation process, in which both accounts are created automatically.
- **Log in**: You will now be able to access both the Dedibox and Scaleway consoles via [account.scaleway.com](https://account.scaleway.com). Once you enter your email address and authenticate, you will choose the console you want to access. It will be possible to switch between the consoles at any time.
- **Account settings**: All your Dedibox and Scaleway accounts and Organization settings will be managed within the same space, offering a centralized and more cohesive experience.

All other functionalities, such as billing, support, and the actual management of your services, will remain individual to each console, for now.

### Which Scaleway account is used for unification?
Your unified account has the same email address as the email address related to your Dedibox account.
If you already had a Scaleway account, for example if you linked your Dedibox and Scaleway account before November 2025, this account must be used to connect to Dedibox console.

<Message type="note">
  For clients who previously link their accounts, during the login workflow, you may be asked to choose an Organization to connect to Dedibox. You must choose the Organization already linked, meaning the one where you can already manage your Dedibox. See more on [Dedibox and Scaleway account linking](/dedibox-scaleway/reference-content/dedibox-scaleway-linking/).
</Message>

### How do I know if I am affected by this change?
Users whose accounts will be unified will receive an email with detailed instructions about the upcoming change.

### How will I know when the unification is completed?
You will receive email notifications to keep you informed about the unification process and any important updates.

### Can I opt out of the unification?
For the process to be effective and ensure a smooth and seamless experience for all users, it is necessary to unify all accounts. We will be available at every step of the process to guide you through this change and help you familiarize yourself with the new experience.

## Access and security

### I have previously linked my Dedibox account to Scaleway. Will I still be able to use both consoles?
Yes. Users who linked their Dedibox and Scaleway accounts **before 28 October 2025** will still be able to use and manage their Dedibox services on both the [Dedibox](https://console.online.net/en/account/home) and [Scaleway](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) consoles.

### How do I log in to the Dedibox console?
You can access your Dedibox account via [account.scaleway.com](https://account.scaleway.com/login?service=dedibox). After entering your email address and authenticating, you will be prompted to select the console you wish to access.

If you have [linked](/dedibox-scaleway/faq/#what-was-the-account-linking-process-and-its-purpose) your Dedibox and Scaleway accounts **before 28 October 2025**, you can also log in via [console.online.net](https://console.online.net).

### Can I still use SMS MFA on my Dedibox account?
No. Multifactor Authentication (MFA) via SMS is now deprecated.
You must select an alternative method to secure your account. [Learn about our available MFA method options](/account/how-to/use-2fa/).

### Can I use SSO on my account?
Yes. You can [set up SSO](/account/how-to/use-2fa/) on your account if your email provider is Google or Microsoft. Alternatively, you can use GitHub if you use the same email address for both accounts. Once configured, you can [authenticate using SSO](/account/how-to/log-in-to-the-console/?tab=log-in-with-sso-0).

### Will my password or credentials change?
In most cases, your password and any configured one-time password (TOTP) authentication methods will remain available after the account unification, except for [SMS MFA](/dedibox-scaleway/faq/#can-i-still-use-sms-mfa-on-my-dedibox-account), which will then be deprecated.

Refer to the table below to know if any password or MFA changes will apply to your situation:

| SITUATION                                                                         | PASSWORD                                      | MULTIFACTOR AUTHENTICATION (MFA)                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **I have a Scaleway account**  | Remains unchanged                       | Remains unchanged |
| **I do not have a Scaleway account** | Remains unchanged                    | Remains unchanged |
| **I may or may not have a Scaleway account, but used SMS as an MFA method** | Remains unchanged | SMS authentication is no longer supported; therefore, MFA has been disabled. You must choose and set up a new method. |
| **I own multiple Dedibox accounts using the same email address** | The password has been erased. You must [access your account using an email authentication code](/account/how-to/log-in-to-the-console/?tab=authentication-code-0) and register a new password. | Any existing MFA has been erased. You must [access your account using an email authentication code](/account/how-to/log-in-to-the-console/?tab=authentication-code-0) and set up a new MFA method. |

### Will I lose any data or configuration after the unification?
No, you will not lose any data or configuration. Your Dedibox servers and their settings will remain unchanged.
If you notice any abnormality, notify the [Dedibox support team](https://console.online.net/en/support/ticket/create).

### Will my Dedibox servers be affected by the unification?
No, your Dedibox servers will not be impacted by the account unification and will remain operational. You will still be able to manage them through the [Dedibox](https://console.online.net/en/account/home) console.

### What happens if I already have MFA enabled on my Scaleway account?
If you log in to Dedibox using an email associated with a Scaleway account that has MFA (via TOTP or passkey), the security settings of the latter will take precedence.
This means you will need to complete the MFA steps from your Scaleway account, using your authenticator app or passkey, when logging in to Dedibox.

This measure ensures a consistent and secure authentication experience across Scaleway services, and you do not need to reconfigure anything, as the system will handle this automatically.

### Can I still use my multifactor authentication (MFA) app?
Yes. If you were using a TOTP-based multifactor authentication app (such as Google Authenticator, Authy, or Microsoft Authenticator) with Dedibox, your MFA settings and credentials will be automatically migrated to Scaleway after the unification.

### Will the current Dedibox API system continue to work?
Yes, the API system is not impacted by account unification.

## Pricing and billing

### Will the account unification affect my billing?
Account unification is free and does not impact your billing. Your Dedibox services and their associated billing will remain unchanged.

The unification is primarily for account management and access convenience, allowing you to manage all your resources from a single Scaleway account.

## Specifications

### Do I have to manage my Dedibox resources on the Scaleway console from now on?
If you have linked your Dedibox account to Scaleway **before 28 October 2025**, you will still have access to your resources in both the [Dedibox](https://console.online.net/en/account/home) and [Scaleway](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) consoles, as before.

If you did not link accounts before that date, your Dedibox resources will be available only in the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net/en/account/home).

### What do I need to do to prepare for the unification?
No action is required from you, as the account unification will be done automatically. We only ask that you **ensure your personal and corporate information is correct and up-to-date**.
After the unification is complete, you will receive emails to inform you about the next steps.

## Usage and management

### Can I edit my account information after the unification?
Yes. Once the account unification is completed, you will be able to manage and update your [Organization](/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#organization) information from the **Settings** space on [account.scaleway.com](http://account.scaleway.com) at any time.

### How do I grant someone access to my account?
You can use the [outsourcing feature](/dedibox-account/how-to/outsource-dedibox/) in the Dedibox console to grant a user access to specific and selected resources.

To give access to the entire account, [create a Member](/iam/how-to/manage-members/) in your Organization instead.

## Support and troubleshooting

### Who do I contact if I have issues or questions about Dedibox?
You can reach out to the [Dedibox support team](https://console.online.net/en/support/ticket/create) if you need any assistance, as usual.

### What should I do if I have questions or need assistance with the unification?

### How long is my server contract?
Your server operates on a monthly contract, with the billing cycle running from the first to the last day of each month. When placing an order, you will be billed pro rata for the current month, unless you pay via SEPA direct debit. In that case, your first invoice will be issued during your first complete month and include both the pro rata amount for the current month and the full amount for the following month.
<Message type="note">
  If you chose a commitment period during server creation, your contract will have a fixed duration of 12 or 36 months, depending on your selected option.
</Message>

### What are Dedibox commitment plans?
A commitment plan allows you to commit to keeping your Dedibox for a period of 12 or 36 months. By choosing a commitment period, you benefit from lower monthly rent for your server and free setup, depending on the plan you choose.

### Can I benefit from a commitment plan on a server I'm already renting?
Yes, in most cases, you can apply a commitment plan to a server you're already renting. To check your eligibility and choose a plan, go to your server in the Scaleway Dedibox console and click **Commitment** in the left-side menu.

### Will my server options also benefit from the discount?
No, the discount applies only to the Dedibox server.

### Is there an automatic renewal of the commitment?
Yes, by default, your commitment is renewed automatically at the end of the commitment period. You can disable the automatic renewal in your server's options.

### At the end of the commitment, what will the price for my Dedibox be?
At the end of the commitment, you will pay the standard price at the time of the subscription. Your commitment discount will no longer apply.

### Can I terminate a Dedibox during the commitment period?
You can request termination at any time, but it will only be effective after the end of the commitment period. You will retain access to your server until the commitment period ends.

### Can I change the commitment period?
No, the commitment period cannot be changed after the subscription.

### Are there commitment plans for Elastic Metal or Dedibox VPS?
No, commitment plans are only available for eligible Dedibox dedicated servers.

Windows Server 2019 and 2022 licenses are billed monthly (no prorating) based on the following factors:
- Number of physical CPUs
- Number of cores per CPU
- Operating System version: Standard or Datacenter
