<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)

- [Generated an API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) and enabled the `SecretManagerFullAccess` [permission set](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/)
- Created a [secret](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/how-to/create-secret/) and have **not** enabled [secret protection](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#secret-protection) on it

1. Click **Secret Manager** in the **Security and Identity** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu.
2. Select the [region](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#region) in which to delete the secret, in the **Region** drop-down.

<Message type="important">
  - Although you cannot delete a [protected secret](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#secret-protection), you can delete its versions
  - Deleting a secret is a permanent action. It erases every version you have created for your secret.
