## DHCP

DHCP was previously a functionality of Scaleway Public Gateways, but has now been moved and is integrated directly into Private Networks. [Read more about DHCP on Private Networks](/network/vpc/concepts#dhcp).

## DNS

The **D**omain **N**ame **S**ystem (DNS) is a naming system for devices connected to the Internet or Private Networks. Most prominently, DNS servers translate text-based domain names (e.g. www.scaleway.com) to numerical [IP addresses](#ip-address) (e.g. 51.158.66.220).

A Public Gateway acts as a local DNS server for the devices within a Private Network, resolving the devices' IP hostnames into their IP addresses. The hostname for a given device is generally the name defined when creating the resource (and which in the case of an Instance, for example, displays in the shell when connected to that resource by SSH).

## Flexible IP

Flexible IP addresses are [public IP addresses](#public-ip-address) associated with your account, which you can hold independently of any created resource. When you create a Public Gateway, it receives a flexible (public) IP address by default. You can [detach, reattach and migrate](/network/public-gateways/how-to/use-flexible-ips/) your flexible IPs between your Public Gateways at your convenience. Note however that each Public Gateway **must** have a public IP attached to it, so if you detach one flexible IP from the Public Gateway you must attach another.

Flexible IPs exist for many resources (Instances, Elastic Metal servers, Load Balancers etc). Note however that each of these sets of flexible IPs is independent, and usable only with that product. Instance flexible IPs cannot be attached to Elastic Metal servers or Public Gateways, and vice versa.

When you delete a flexible IP address, it is disassociated from your account to be used by other users.

## IP address

An **I**nternet **P**rotocol address is a unique address that identifies a device on the Internet or a local network. Written in human-readable notations, an IP address is generally shown as 4 octets of numbers, e.g. 72.16.254.1. IP addresses can be [public](#public-ip-address) or [private](#private-ip-address).

</Concept>

## NAT
**N**etwork **A**ddress **T**ranslation (NAT) maps private IP addresses in a Private Network to the public IP address of the Public Gateway. Private IP addresses are not routable on the public Internet, so NAT makes it possible for them to securely communicate with the Internet via the gateway. There are two types of NAT:

- **Dynamic NAT** enables egress traffic from a Private Network to the public Internet by dynamically, automatically mapping the outgoing traffic IP addresses and ports with the public IP address and ports of the Public Gateway.

- **Static NAT** enables ingress traffic from the public Internet towards devices on a Private Network by mapping pre-defined ports of the public IP address of the gateway to specific ports and IP addresses on the Private Network.

See our documentation on [reviewing and configuring NAT](/network/public-gateways/how-to/configure-a-public-gateway/#how-to-review-and-configure-nat) for more information.

## Private IP address

Private [IP addresses](#ip-address) identify devices on local/Private Networks. They are not routed on the Internet - if you enter the private IP address of an Instance into a random browser connected to the Internet, it will not connect to anything. This is because a private IP address is only relevant within a particular local network. Devices within a local network can communicate securely between themselves via their private IP addresses.

</Concept>

## Private Network

Scaleway's Private Networks feature [allows you to create a LAN-like layer 2 ethernet network between your Scaleway resources](/network/public-gateways/how-to/use-private-networks/#how-to-create-a-private-network/). When you [connect an Instance](/network/public-gateways/how-to/use-private-networks/#how-to-attach-and-detach-resources-tofrom-a-private-network/) to a Private Network, a new network interface is configured on the that Instance, with a unique media access control address (MAC address). When connecting an Elastic Metal server to a Private Network, a new VLAN is allocated on the public interface. Private Networks thus allow your Scaleway resources to communicate in an isolated and secure network without the need of being connected to the public Internet. Each resource can be connected to one or several Private Networks. You can also opt to [attach a Public Gateway](/network/public-gateways/how-to/use-private-networks/#how-to-attach-and-detach-public-gateways-tofrom-a-private-network/) to your Private Networks, for extra functionality.

Classic Private Networks are scoped to a single Availability Zone, but our [regional Private Networks](/network/vpc/concepts/#regional-private-networks/) product is currently available in Public Beta.

## Public Gateway

Public Gateways sit at the border of Private Networks and provide a secure point of entry from the public Internet to your infrastructure. They also offer extra functionality, including [NAT](#nat) and [SSH bastion](#ssh-bastion). You can [add a Public Gateway](/network/public-gateways/how-to/configure-a-public-gateway#how-to-attach-a-public-gateway-to-a-private-network) to each of your Private Networks.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Public IP address

Public [IP addresses](#ip-address) identify devices on the Internet. You can enter the public IP address of an Instance into any browser connected to the Internet, and access content being served from that Instance. You can think of public IP addresses like postal addresses for buildings - they are unique, and tell the routers directing traffic through the Internet where to find a particular server.

## SSH bastion

[SSH bastion](/network/public-gateways/how-to/use-ssh-bastion) is a server dedicated to managing connections to the infrastructure behind your Public Gateway. When you activate SSH bastion on your Public Gateway, all the SSH keys held in your Project credentials are imported to the SSH bastion, providing a single point of entry. This makes management of your infrastructure easier and more secure.

</Concept>

## Tags
Tags let you organize your Public Gateways. You can assign as many tags as you want to each gateway, and use this feature to identify, sort and filter them.
