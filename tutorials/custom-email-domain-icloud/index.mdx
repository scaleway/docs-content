iCloud is the service from Apple that allows you to securely stores and manage your data accross the whole Apple ecosystem.

While its most used for the storage of photos or the backup of devices in the cloud, an iCloud+ feature correctly named **Custom Email Domain** allow you to set up an email address with your own domain.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- An iCloud account upgraded with [iCloud+ premium features](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108047)
- [Configured a domain name](/domains-and-dns/quickstart/)
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization


## Adding the domain on iCloud
