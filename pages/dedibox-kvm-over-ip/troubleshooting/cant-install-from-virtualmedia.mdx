Installation from virtual media allows users to boot servers using custom ISO images over the network.
Dedibox provides an archive of several installation images at [https://virtualmedia.online.net/](virtualmedia.online.net).
However, this feature is currently not supported on specific Elastic Metal server models due to instability issues.

<Requirements />

- A Dedibox account logged into the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net)
- A Dedibox Start-9-M server

## Affected servers

The following Elastic Metal server models are impacted by this limitation:

- Dedibox Start-9-M

## Reason for lack of support

Installation through virtual media on Dedibox Start-9-M servers is highly unstable due to hardware-specific compatibility issues with the virtual media boot process. We do not currently have a stable solution to resolve these problems.

<Message type="tip">
  For alternative installation methods, consider using the default OS images available directly from the Dedibox console or [rescue mode](/dedibox/how-to/use-rescue-mode/) for troubleshooting.
</Message>

## Next steps

1. If you encounter issues during installation, verify your server model in the Dedibox console.
2. Use supported installation options, such as pre-built images from the Dedibox console.
3. Contact [Dedibox technical support](https://console.infra.online.net/en/support/ticket/create) for assistance or updates on future support.

<Message type="note">
  We are working on potential solutions and will update this documentation once virtual media support is available for these models.
