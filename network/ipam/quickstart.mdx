**IP** **A**ddress **M**anager (IPAM) is Scaleway's tool for planning, tracking and managing the IP address space of Scaleway products. It acts as a single source of truth for the IP addresses of Scaleway resources.

[Read more about IPAM and its current and future planned functionality](/network/ipam/concepts/#ipam).

You can currently use IPAM in the Scaleway console to list the [private IP addresses](/network/ipam/concepts/#private-ip-address) of all your Scaleway resources attached to Private Networks, and view/edit their additional information. You can also [reserve](/network/ipam/how-to/reserve-ip/) a private IP on one of your Private Networks and use it to attach an Instance, Load Balancer or Public Gateway to the network.

## How to list and filter your private IP addresses

1. Click **IPAM** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu.

    A list of your **private IP addresses** for the **region** and **VPC** pre-selected in the filters displays. Addresses are displayed here if they are reserved in IPAM. This means either:

    - You manually reserved an address via IPAM (currently only possible via the [IPAM API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/ipam/#path-ips-book-a-new-ip)), or
    - You [attached a resource to a Private Network](/network/vpc/how-to/attach-resources-to-pn/): this triggers IPAM to reserve and attach an IP address for the resource on the network.

    The full range of IP addresses which are available but unreserved in each of your Private Network's [CIDR blocks](/network/vpc/concepts/#cidr-block) do not display in the list.

2. Modify the filters of the list using the drop-down menus at the top. You can filter for IP addresses within a given **region**, **VPC** and/or **Private Network**. You can also opt to filter for only [IPv4](/network/ipam/concepts/#ipv4) or [IPv6](/network/ipam/concepts/#ipv6) addresses:

3. Click **Apply filters** to activate the filters you chose, or **Reset** to reset all filters. 

## How to view and edit the details of a private IP address

1. Click **IPAM** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu.

    A list of your **private IP addresses** for the **region** and **VPC** pre-selected in the filters displays. Addresses are displayed here if they are reserved in IPAM (either manually reserved via the [IPAM API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/ipam/#path-ips-book-a-new-ip)), or attached to a resource [on a Private Network](/network/vpc/how-to/attach-resources-to-pn/).

2. Modify the filters of the list using the drop-down menus at the top if necessary to display the required IP address.

3. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the IP address whose details you want to view, then click **More info**.

    A screen similar to the following displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-ipam-moreinfo.webp" alt=""/>

    You can view the following information:
    - The IP address
    - The **region** of the IP address
    - Which **resource** (if any) it is attached to
    - The **ID** of the IP address
    - The date on which the IP was **created**. This corresponds to the date it was reserved in IPAM, either via a manual [API reservation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/ipam/#path-ips-book-a-new-ip) or when it was attached to a resource on a Private Network.
    - The date on which the IP was last **updated**
    - The **tags** associated with the IP address. You can edit these tags if you wish.

4. Click **OK** to exit the screen.

## How to reserve a private IP address

1. Click **IPAM** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu.

2. Click **Reserve private IP**. The following screen displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-reserve-ip.webp" alt="A pop-up screen, showing the parameters to define for the private IP to reserve: type (IPv4 or IPv6), tags, region, VPC and Private Network" />

3. Define the parameters for the private IP address you want to reserve:
    - **IP type**: IPv4 or IPv6
    - **Tags**: Tags to help you filter and manage your reserved IPs later
    - **Region**: The region in which you want to reserve a private IP address
    - **VPC**: The VPC in which you want to reserve a private IP address
    - **Private Network**: The Private Network in which you want to reserve a private IP address. The reserved IP will be from this network's [CIDR block](/network/vpc/concepts/), and available to attach resources to this network.

4. Define whether you want to specify the IP address to reserve, or reserve any available IP on the Private Network (the IP selected will be displayed after reservation). If specifying the IP address yourself, do **not** include the network prefix (e.g. `/22`).

    The IP address is reserved, and you are returned to the list of your private IP addresses, where the reserved address now displays. You can use this address to attach a resource to the Private Network you reserved it from. If and when you no longer need the reserved IP, you can [release](/network/ipam/how-to/reserve-ip/#how-to-release-a-reserved-private-ip-address) it.
