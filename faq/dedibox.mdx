## Dedibox dedicated servers

### Which dedicated server should I choose?

### How long does it take to deliver my dedicated server?
The delivery of Dedibox dedicated servers is ultra-fast: 2 minutes on average. Next, choose your operating system in our library or install your ISO image directly. Any configuration displayed on our website is available in stock for instant delivery.

### How long is my server contract?
You are on a monthly contract, the billing cycle is always from the first to the last day of each month. When placing an order, you will be billed pro rata for the current month, except if you are paying using SEPA direct debit. In this case, your first invoice will be issued during your first complete month and includes the pro rata amount for the current month in addition to the next full month.

### Where are the Dedibox dedicated servers hosted?
All Dedibox servers and associated services are hosted in our Paris & Amsterdam datacenters. We also have a Warsaw datacenter.

Scaleway does not have access to your data; however, you are responsible for your backups and the redundancy systems to be put in place to ensure continuity of service even in the event of hardware failure.

### I need help, who can I talk to?
When choosing your servers for your use case, you can contact our solution advisors [here](https://www.scaleway.com/en/contact/). For technical assistance on the configuration and use of your servers, our experts are at your disposal.

### What is your policy regarding IP addresses?
Public IPv4 addresses have become a rare and expensive resource. Each dedicated server is provided with a public IPv4 address at no extra cost. Additional addresses are available for an additional charge with the “IP Failover” option.

### How is the price of my server calculated?
Our prices are updated daily based on demand, available stocks, and component and energy market prices. Some components, such as RAM memory and SSD disks, have high volatility. Do not worry, the price at the time of order is guaranteed for the first 12 months of your subscription.
