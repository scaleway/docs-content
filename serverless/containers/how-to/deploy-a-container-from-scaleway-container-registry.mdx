This page shows you how to deploy your first Serverless Container from Scaleway Container Registry. A container is a package of software that includes all dependencies: code, runtime, configuration, and system libraries so that it can run on any host system. This allows you to control your production environment. Scaleway provides you with custom Docker images that are entirely handled for you in the cloud. With Serverless Containers, you can rely on your favorite technologies such as Django or Ruby on Rails.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created a containers namespace](/serverless/containers/how-to/create-a-containers-namespace/)
  - You have [created a Container Registry namespace](/containers/container-registry/how-to/create-namespace/) and [pushed a container image](/containers/container-registry/how-to/push-images/) to it
</Message>

You can deploy a container either from the [Scaleway Container Registry](/containers/container-registry/quickstart/) or from any other public container registry (Docker Hub, AWS Container registries, GitLab container registry, etc.).

### Deploy from the Scaleway Container Registry

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The containers page displays.
2. Click the relevant containers namespace.
3. Click **Deploy container**. The container creation wizard displays.
4. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Select the **Scaleway** Container Registry.
    - Choose an **image** from your Container Registry. Select the required Container Registry Namespace from the drop-down list, and then select the container and tag.
    - Choose the **Port** your container is listening on. We recommend configuring your container to listen on the **PORT** environment variable.
    - Choose a **name** for your container, and optionally a **description**. The name must only contain alphanumeric characters and dashes.
    - Choose the **resources** to be allocated to your container at runtime. These define the performance characteristics of your container.
    - Set your **scaling** preferences, or leave them at default values. The Scaleway platform autoscales the number of available instances of your container to match the incoming load, depending on the settings you define here.
    - Define any **environment variables** you want to inject into your container. For each environment variable, click **+Add new variable** and enter the key/value pair.
    - Add **secrets** for your container. Secrets are environment variables which are injected into your container, but the values are not retained or displayed by Scaleway after initial validation.
    - Set the desired **privacy policy** for your container. This defines whether container invocation may be done anonymously (**public**) or only via an authentication mechanism provided by the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-containers/#authentication) (**private**). 
    - Click **Advanced Options** if you wish to set a custom timeout for your container.
    - Verify the **estimated cost**.
5. Click **Deploy container** to finish.
