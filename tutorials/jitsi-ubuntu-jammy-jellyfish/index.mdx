### Installing Jitsi Meet

1. Configure the hostname of the server corresponding to your domain or subdomain.
    ```
    hostnamectl set-hostname jitsi
    sed -i 's/^127.0.1.1.*$/127.0.1.1 jitsi.mydomain.tld jitsi/g' /etc/hosts
    sed -i 's/^127.0.0.1.*$/127.0.0.1 localhost jitsi.mydomain.tld jitsi/g' /etc/hosts
    ```
2. Update the apt packet cache and upgrade the software installed on the instance to the latest version available on the Debian repositories.
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade
    ```
3. Install an [Nginx](https://nginx.org) web server. The Jitsi installation tool handles the Nginx configuration if it is present on the system.
    ```
    apt install -y nginx
    systemctl start nginx.service
    systemctl enable nginx.service
    ```

    <Message type="important">
        If Nginx or Apache are not installed, Jitsi Meet will automatically install [Jetty](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) during the installation.

4. Download and install the Prosody package repository. 
    ```
    echo deb http://packages.prosody.im/debian $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
    wget https://prosody.im/files/prosody-debian-packages.key -O- | sudo apt-key add -
    apt install lua5.2
    ```
5. Download the APT key and set up the repositories of Jitsi:
    ```
    wget -qO - https://download.jitsi.org/jitsi-key.gpg.key | apt-key add -
    sh -c "echo 'deb https://download.jitsi.org stable/' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jitsi-stable.list"
    apt update
    ```
6. Launch the installation of Jitsi Meet.
    ```
    apt install -y jitsi-meet
    ```

    When asked, enter:

    - The FQDN of your instance. For example `jitsi.mydomain.tld` and press Enter. 
    - When asked about the SSL certificate choose the `Let's Encrypt certificates` option and press Enter.
    - Your email address.
    - Your phone number (optional).
7. Open a Web-browser and type the FQDN of your instance, for example: `https://jitsi.mydomain.tld`. The following screen displays:
