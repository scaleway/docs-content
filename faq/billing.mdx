## How am I billed for Scaleway services?

All Public Cloud services are based on the "pay as you go" model, which means that you only pay for what you use.
Your monthly invoice is calculated at the end of each month and based on your hourly resource usage during the month.

<Message type="important">
  Some of our products are invoiced separately.
</Message>

For example:
The Stardust1-s indicated at €0,0025 excl/hour can be split up as follows:
- €0.00198/hour for the IP
- €0.0004/hour for the 10 GB of local storage
- €0.00012/hour for the instance

For more information, refer to our dedicated [pricing page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/).

## When does the billing of an Instance start and stop?

The final price of your Instance is calculated according to the characteristics of your resource. Each of these resources are billed separately for a minimum of 60 minutes.

Each uninterrupted period between a start and a stop billing event will be considered a unique resource. It is the number of these unique resources noted within a month that are displayed in the consumption table of your invoice.

Below is a detailed list of what is considered as start and stop billing events for each resource class:

  | Resource type         | Billing Starts                                                                            | Billing Stops                                                                              | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
  |-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Compute Instances     | The moment you click the **Power On** button (when your Instance is already powered off). | The moment the Instance is **Powered Off**.                                                | The Instance is not billed during its shutdown process. A hard reboot will keep the ongoing resource running.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
  | Elastic Metal servers | The moment the server is **created**.                                                     | The moment the server is **deleted**.                                                      | When an Elastic Metal server is powered off, the physical machine remains allocated to the user's account, meaning the resource continues to be billed.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
  | Apple silicon         | The moment the Mac mini is **created**.                                                   | The moment the Mac mini is **deleted**.                                                    | Due to license constraints, the minimum lease for Apple silicon-as-a-Service is 24 hours. As a result, **a Mac mini can only be deleted after a minimum allocation period of 24 hours**.  When a Mac mini is powered off, the physical machine remains allocated to the user's account, meaning the resource continues to be billed. |
  | Flexible IP Address   | The moment you reserve an IP.                                                             | The moment you cancel a reservation.                                                       | This class of IP is billed as long as you keep the reservation open. You will be billed whether you are effectively using the IP or not.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## What does pro-rata billing for Dedibox and Web Hosting services mean?

You are billed pro-rata for the initial month of a subscription. This means the charge is adjusted to reflect the portion of the first month you used the service.
Starting from the second month and onwards, you are billed in full at the beginning of each month, covering the entire upcoming billing period in advance.
This billing model ensures that you pay for the service based on your actual usage for the first month and then in advance for subsequent months.

## How to read my invoice?

Refer to the [Reading an invoice](/console/billing/additional-content/reading-an-invoice) documentation page for a detailed description of your invoices.

## When are invoices issued?

Invoices are issued each month based on the resources' consumption of the previous month.
Our reference billing period is the definition of a calendar month in the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) time zone.
The automatic payment of invoices occurs in the first few days of a month, once the invoice is issued and is processed by using the preferred payment method of your account.

## How can I manage my billing?

You can manage your billing from the [billing section](https://console.scaleway.com/billing/overview) of the Scaleway console. Your recent invoices as well as the consumption report of the current month are available for download.
Alternatively, you can retrieve your consumption information and download your invoices using the [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/billing/).

## What does the status of my invoice mean?

The status of an invoice can be:
* **Draft**: Refers to the invoice for the current calendar month. The billing period has not yet finished, so the invoice is not finalized and is subject to change.
* **Stopped**: Refers to invoices where the billing period (calendar month) has ended, but the invoice is not yet issued.
* **Issued**: Refers to a final invoice awaiting payment. It has a unique number, and is non-repudiable. The invoice charges for the resources consumed over the corresponding billing period.
* **Paid**: Refers to a fully paid invoice. No further action is required.
* **Incomplete**: Refers to invoices where the user has provided incorrect billing details or payment information, or elements of this information are missing. The user must update this information as soon as possible to avoid having their account deleted.
* **Outdated**: Refers to invoices where there has been a change in billing information, for example a discount has been applied, or the client has amended their billing details. An updated invoice will be issued soon.

## Do the prices shown on the website include EU VAT?

Prices announced on our website exclude all taxes.

Because we are a European company, we are required to charge VAT on all orders made by European individual customers (B2C).
The appropriate VAT rate is automatically applied to your invoice, depending on your fiscal residence. Just make sure your administrative details on your profile, such as postal address, recipient name, and phone number are in order.
No other additional taxes, but European VAT is collected.

If you are not located in one of the 27 member states of the European Union, no other tax will be added to your invoice, per application of EU laws.
European B2B customers are exempted from VAT, as long as they provide a registered VAT number. Just add your VAT registry number to your profile, and your invoice will be updated accordingly.

If you do not provide a valid VAT number, you will be considered as an individual customer (B2C), and the local rate will be applied.

## Which payment methods does Scaleway accept?

We accept Visa, MasterCard, CB, UnionPay and American Express.

## How can I pay my invoice?

We automatically initiate one payment transaction from your preferred payment method at the start of each new month. Once an invoice is issued, you have 10 days to regularize it (see section 6.3 of our Terms of Service). As a reminder, the due date of payment is displayed on each invoice once issued.

If the automatic payment fails, you will be notified by mail of payment failure and invited to initiate a new transaction from your account.

If after several manual attempts you cannot manage to trigger a successful transaction, you may add another credit card. Keep in mind to make this card the active card and re-initiate a payment transaction.

<Message type="note">
  Failed SEPA payments can only be regularized by credit or debit card payment.
</Message>

<Message type="important">
  If you are unable to settle your invoice after the due date, your account is going to be suspended and your resources will be unreachable. You will then have another ten days to regularize your invoice, before your resources are deleted.
</Message>

## How can I add a billing contact to my account?

The billing contact is an additional contact linked to your account which will receive your monthly invoices. This can be useful if invoices in your Organization are handled by another department.
You can add a billing contact directly from the User Account section of your Scaleway console.

1. Log into your Scaleway console.
2. On the Organization drop-down menu, click **Billing**. The billing section displays.
3. Enter the new billing contact e-mail address.
4. Click **Save**.
    <Message type="important">
      The billing contact is only an administrative contact. It can not be used to connect to the Scaleway console.

## How can I obtain a SEPA Mandate?

Refer to the [How to add a payment method](/console/billing/how-to/add-payment-method#how-to-add-a-sepa-mandate) documentation page for a complete guide on how to add a SEPA mandate.
