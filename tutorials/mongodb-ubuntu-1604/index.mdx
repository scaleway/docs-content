MongoDB is a document-oriented database that is free and open-source. It considered one of the most popular NoSQL database engines because it is scalable, powerful, reliable and easy to use.
In contrast to relational database, MongoDB does not require a deep predefined schema before you can add data since it can be altered at any time. As it uses the NoSQL concept, data rows are stored in JSON-like documents which allows arbitrary data to be inserted.

## Setting up MongoDB

### Adding MongoDB Repository

<Message type="important">
  You should always use the official MongoDB `mongodb-org` packages, which are kept up-to-date with the most recent major and minor MongoDB releases.
</Message>

1. [Connect to your Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/) via SSH.
    ```
    ssh root@your.instance.ip.address
    ```

2. Update the Ubuntu package manager (`apt`)
    ```
    apt update
    ```
3. Upgrade the Ubuntu packages already installed
    ```
    apt upgrade -y
    ```
4. Import the key for the official MongoDB repository (Ubuntu ensures the authenticity of software packages by verifying that they are signed with GPG keys.)
    ```
    wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-6.0.asc |  apt-key add -
    ```
5. Add the MongoDB repository details so that Ubuntu's `apt` command-line tool will know where to download the packages. Execute the following command to create a list file for MongoDB.
    ```
    echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu jammy/mongodb-org/6.0 multiverse" |  tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-6.0.list
    ```
6. Update the packages list
    ```
    apt update
    ```

### Installing MongoDB

1. Install the `mongodb-org` meta-package, which includes the daemon, configuration and init scripts, shell, and management tools on the server.
    ```
    apt install mongodb-org
    ```
2. Press enter or type `Y` to proceed when prompted. Once the installation is completed, we start the MongoDB daemon
    ```
    systemctl start mongod.service
    ```
3. Since `systemctl` does not provide output, verify that the service has started properly.
    ```
    systemctl status mongod
    ```
    ```
    ● mongod.service - MongoDB Database Server
        Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/mongod.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)

          Docs: https://docs.mongodb.org/manual
      Main PID: 2453 (mongod)

                └─2453 /usr/bin/mongod --config /etc/mongod.conf
    ```
4. Ensure that it restarts automatically at each boot
    ```
     systemctl enable mongod.service
    ```
    ```
    Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/mongod.service to /lib/systemd/system/mongod.service.
    ```

### Securing MongoDB

The default installation of MongoDB is vulnerable because no authentication is required to interact with the database. Any user could create and destroy databases, as well as read from and write to their contents by default. To secure MongoDB, we need to create an administrative user and enable authentication.

1. Connect to the Mongo shell to add a new user
    ```
    mongosh
    ```
    <Message type="note">
    The legacy mongo shell was deprecated in MongoDB 5.0 and removed in MongoDB 6.0. The new MongoDB Shell, mongosh, offers numerous advantages over the legacy shell.
    </Message>
    ```
    Current Mongosh Log ID:	637b7314f10d3c7da4e43aa0
    Connecting to:		mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/?directConnection=true&serverSelectionTimeoutMS=2000&appName=mongosh+1.6.0
    Using MongoDB:		6.0.3
    Using Mongosh:		1.6.0

    For mongosh info see: https://docs.mongodb.com/mongodb-shell/


    To help improve our products, anonymous usage data is collected and sent to MongoDB periodically (https://www.mongodb.com/legal/privacy-policy).
    You can opt-out by running the disableTelemetry() command.

    ------
      The server generated these startup warnings when booting
      2022-11-21T12:44:17.875+00:00: Using the XFS filesystem is strongly recommended with the WiredTiger storage engine. See http://dochub.mongodb.org/core/prodnotes-filesystem
      2022-11-21T12:44:18.184+00:00: Access control is not enabled for the database. Read and write access to data and configuration is unrestricted

    ------

    ------
      Enable MongoDB's free cloud-based monitoring service, which will then receive and display
      metrics about your deployment (disk utilization, CPU, operation statistics, etc).

      The monitoring data will be available on a MongoDB website with a unique URL accessible to you
      and anyone you share the URL with. MongoDB may use this information to make product
      improvements and to suggest MongoDB products and deployment options to you.

      To enable free monitoring, run the following command: db.enableFreeMonitoring()
      To permanently disable this reminder, run the following command: db.disableFreeMonitoring()
    ------

    test>
    ```

    You can choose any preferred name for the administrative user since the privilege level is assigned from the role of `userAdminAnyDatabase`.

    The `admin` database designates where the credentials are stored. You can learn more about authentication in the [MongoDB Security Authentication section](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/authentication/).
2. Set the username of your choice and be sure to pick your own secure password and substitute them in the command below:
    ```
    use admin
    db.createUser(
      {
        user: "AdminOce",
        pwd: "PWD2018AdminOce",
        roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" } ]
      }
    )
    ```
    ```
    use admin
    switched to db admin
    > db.createUser(
    ...   {
    ...     user: "AdminOce",
    ...     pwd: "PWD2022AdminOce",
    ...     roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" } ]
    ...   }
    ... )
    Successfully added user: {
      "user" : "AdminOce",
      "roles" : [
        {
          "role" : "userAdminAnyDatabase",
          "db" : "admin"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
3. Type `exit` and press ENTER or use `CTRL+C` to leave the client.
    ```
    > exit
    bye
    ```

### Enabling authentication

In order to enforce authentication, we need to enable authentication and restart the MongoDB daemon.

1. Open the configuration file
    ```
     nano /etc/mongod.conf
    ```
2. In the `#security` section, remove the hash in front of security to enable the section. Then, we add the authorization lines (indented with two spaces) as per the following excerpt below:
    ```
    security:
    authorization: "enabled"
    ```
3. Restart the daemon
    ```
    systemctl restart mongod.service
    ```
4. Check the status to verify that the service has rebooted
    ```
    systemctl status mongod.service
    ```
    ```
    ● mongod.service - MongoDB Database Server
        Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/mongod.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)
        Active: active (running) since Mon 2022-11-21 12:44:17 UTC; 6min ago
          Docs: https://docs.mongodb.org/manual
      Main PID: 2453 (mongod)
        Memory: 67.0M
            CPU: 2.074s
        CGroup: /system.slice/mongod.service
                └─2453 /usr/bin/mongod --config /etc/mongod.conf
    ```
5. Ensure that the daemon restarts automatically at boot
    ```
     systemctl enable mongod.service
    ```

### Testing authentication

1. Connect without credentials to verify that our actions are restricted
    ```
    mongosh
    ```
    ```
    Current Mongosh Log ID:	637b74912a82c7f73d453e15
    Connecting to:		mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/?directConnection=true&serverSelectionTimeoutMS=2000&appName=mongosh+1.6.0
    Using MongoDB:		6.0.3
    Using Mongosh:		1.6.0

    For mongosh info see: https://docs.mongodb.com/mongodb-shell/

    test>
    ```

    We are connected to the test database.
2. Test that the access is restricted with the `show dbs` command:
    ```
    test> show dbs
    MongoServerError: command listDatabases requires authentication
    ```
3. Exit the shell to proceed
    ```
    > exit
    bye
    ```

### Verifying the administrative user's access

1. Connect as our administrator with the `-u` option to supply a username and `-p` to be prompted for a password. Supply the database where we stored the user's authentication credentials with the `--authenticationDatabase` option.
    ```
    mongosh -u AdminOce -p --authenticationDatabase admin
    ```
2. Once the correct password is entered, we are dropped into the shell, where we can issue the `show dbs` command:
    ```
    Enter password: ***************
    Current Mongosh Log ID:	637b7509efc9d145b6279982
    Connecting to:		mongodb://<credentials>@127.0.0.1:27017/?directConnection=true&serverSelectionTimeoutMS=2000&authSource=admin&appName=mongosh+1.6.0
    Using MongoDB:		6.0.3
    Using Mongosh:		1.6.0

    For mongosh info see: https://docs.mongodb.com/mongodb-shell/

    test> show dbs
    admin   148.00 KiB
    config   60.00 KiB
    local    72.00 KiB
    ```

Type `exit` or press `CTRL+C` to exit.

## Configuring remote access (Optional) 

### Enabling UFW

Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW), is a front-end to iptables. Its main goal is to make managing your firewall drop-dead simple and to provide an easy-to-use interface.

<Message type="note">
  If UFW is already installed on your computer, go directly to step 5.
</Message> 

1. Install UFW.
    ```
    apt install ufw
    ```
2. Check UFW status.
    ```
     ufw status
    ```
3. Enable UFW, as it is probably inactive.
    ```
     ufw enable
    ```
4. Ensure to allow SSH.
    ```
     ufw allow OpenSSH
    ```
5. Rerun the UFW status command.
    ```
     ufw status
    ```
    ```
    Status: active

    To                         Action      From
    --                         ------      ----
    OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
    OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
    ```
6. Allow access to the default MongoDB port `27017` but restrict that access to a specific host.
    ```
     ufw allow from client_ip_address to any port 27017
    ```
7. Re-run this command using the IP address for each additional client that needs access. To double-check the rule, run `ufw status` again:
    ```
     ufw status
    ```
    ```
    To                         Action      From
    --                         ------      ----
    OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
    27017                      ALLOW       client_ip_address
    OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
    ```

### Configuring a public bindIP

1. To allow remote connections, add our host's publically-routable IP address to the `mongod.conf` file.
    ```
     nano /etc/mongod.conf
    ```
2. In the `net` section, add the MongoHost's IP to the bindIp line
    <Message type="note">
      Verify your private IP with the `ifconfig` command.
    </Message> 

    ```
    net:
      port: 27017
      bindIp: 127.0.0.1,IP_of_MongoHost
    ```
3. Restart the daemon
    ```
    systemctl restart mongod.service
    ```
4. Check the daemon status
    ```
    systemctl status mongod.service
    ```
    ```
    Active: active (running) since Thu 2022-xx-yy 13:15:35 UTC; 5s ago
    ```

### Testing remote connections

Ensure that Mongo is listening on its public interface by adding the `--host` flag with the IP address from the `mongodb.conf file`.
```
mongo -u AdminOce -p --authenticationDatabase admin --host IP_address_of_MongoHost
```

```
Current Mongosh Log ID:	637b7509efc9d145b6279982
Connecting to:		mongodb://<credentials>@127.0.0.1:27017/?directConnection=true&serverSelectionTimeoutMS=2000&authSource=admin&appName=mongosh+1.6.0
Using MongoDB:		6.0.3
Using Mongosh:		1.6.0
```

### Uninstalling MongoDB

<Message type="important">
  This process will completely remove MongoDB, its configuration, and all databases. This process is not reversible, so ensure that all of your configuration and data is backed up before proceeding.
</Message>

1. Stop MongoDB.
    ```
     service mongod stop
    ```
2. Remove any MongoDB packages that you had previously installed.
    ```
    apt purge mongodb-org*
    ```
3. Remove MongoDB databases and log files.
    ```
     rm -r /var/log/mongodb
     rm -r /var/lib/mongodb
