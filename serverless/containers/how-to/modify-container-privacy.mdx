This page shows you how to modify a container's [privacy policy](/serverless/containers/concepts/#privacy-policy), if you wish to do so after creation.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [deployed a container](/serverless/containers/how-to/deploy-a-container/)
</Message>

<Message type="note">
  Setting a container to private will not take care of the actual authentication, as token validation is done at runtime. For further information, refer to the [developers documentation](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/containers/api/#authentication).
</Message>

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The containers page displays.

3. Click the name of the container whose privacy policy you want to modify.
