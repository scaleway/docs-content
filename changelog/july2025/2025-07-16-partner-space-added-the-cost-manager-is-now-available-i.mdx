Partners can now consult their clients' consumption directly in the console, in a new Partner space section called “Billing”.

They can filter by:
- Client (by customer Organization name)
- Period (by year)
- Category (by product category, e.g. Compute, Storage, Containers, with each category corresponding to a different color in the consumption chart and detailed list)
- Product (by product, with the consumption shown being the sum of all the products of the same type.)

Refer to the [documentation page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/partner-space/how-to/track-client-consumption/)  for more details
