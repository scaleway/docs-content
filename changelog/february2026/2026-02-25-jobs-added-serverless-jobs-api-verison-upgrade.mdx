The Serverless Jobs API changed from `v1alpha1` to `v1alpha2`, and now offers new features:
- The `command` field has been upgraded to `startup_command` and `args` for improved flexibility and more use cases
- The `reason` field was added to give more context about how a job is terminated

For more details about the changes, [read our dedicated documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/serverless-jobs/reference-content/v1alpha1-to-v1alpha2/).
