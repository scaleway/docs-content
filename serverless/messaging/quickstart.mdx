Scaleway Messaging and Queuing is a [message broker](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#messaging-and-queuing) tool that allows you to transfer messages between different microservices and platforms. This enables them to "talk" to each other effectively even if they are not otherwise compatible. Messaging and Queuing enables and simplifies microservices application development and allows you to build highly scalable, reliable, distributed applications.

To get started with Scaleway Messaging and Queuing, you need to activate your protocol of choice (SQS or SNS) - or, in the case of the NATS protocol, create a NATS account. You should then generate credentials, and in the case of SQS, use the console to start creating queues. After this, you can then use any supported SDK or CLI of your choice to start creating and managing queues, topics and messages.

This quickstart guide is divided into two sections, depending on the protocol you want to use with Messaging and Queuing (SQS/SNS, or NATS).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## Quickstart for SQS

### How to activate SQS

SQS must be activated for each region you want to use, before you can start creating credentials, queues or other resources for this protocol. You can deactivate at any time.

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The following screen displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-activate-mandq.webp" alt="" />

2. Select a [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) from the drop-down menu. The region designates the geographical area where the service will be hosted.

3. Click **SQS**. A message displays prompting you to click a button to activate the protocol. It also reminds you that activating the protocol does not trigger any billing, and that you can deactivate at any time.

4. Click **Activate SQS**.

    The protocol is activated for the pre-selected region, and you are invited to generate credentials.

### How to create SQS credentials

Credentials for SQS are granular: you can define the level of access that they should give.

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of Messaging and Queuing protocols displays.

2. Use the dropdown menu to select the [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) in which you want to create credentials.

3. Click **SQS**, then **Generate credentials**. A pop-up displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-generate-creds-sqs.webp" alt="" />

4. Enter a name for these credentials.

5. Select the required permissions for the credentials. You must choose at least one of **Write**, **Read** and **Manage**. You are free to select any combination of these permissions.

6. Click **Generate credentials**.

    The credentials are created. The access key and secret key are displayed, and you are invited to copy them.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-sqs-sns-creds-generated.webp" alt="" />

    <Message type="important">
      This is your only chance to view and save the secret key. Make sure that you copy it and save it somewhere securely.
    </Message>

7. Copy and save the credentials, before closing the window.

    You are returned to your Messaging and Queuing SQS service's **Credentials** tab. The name of your newly-generated credentials, along with the access key and access level are displayed.

### How to create queues

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of Messaging and Queuing protocols displays.

2. Use the dropdown menu to select the [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) in which you want to create a queue.

3. Click **SQS**, then **Create queue**. The queue creation wizard displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-queue.webp" alt="" />

4. Check the [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) that your queue will be created in. If you want to change the region, go back to step 2.

5. Enter a **name** for your queue. The name must be no more than 80 characters, and consist only of alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. Alternatively, you can go with the auto-generated name suggested for you.

6. Choose your **queue type**, from one of the following:
    - **Standard**: Standard queues ensure at-least-once delivery. The exact order of messages in the queue is not preserved.
    - **FIFO**: FIFO queues (**F**irst **In** **F**irst **O**ut) preserves the exact ordering of messages.

7. Configure your queue's **parameters**. The following parameters can be defined:
    - **Visibility timeout**: The length of time (in seconds) during which, after a message is received, it is hidden and cannot be received again by the same or other consumers. This is useful as the queue itself does not automatically delete messages once they are received, and so prevents consumers from receiving the same message many times before they have finished processing it. Therefore, the value set here should be informed by the expected length of time it will take consumers to process messages. The default value is 30 seconds. The value must be between 1 second and 43 200 seconds (12 hours).
    - **Message retention period**: The length of time (in seconds) that messages are kept in the queue before being deleted. Setting a longer message retention period allows for a longer interval between a message being sent and it being received. The default value is 60 seconds. The value must be between 60 seconds and 1 290 600 seconds (14 days).
    - **Maximum message size**: The maximum size (in kilobytes) of a message that can be sent to the queue. Messages greater than the defined size will be rejected. The default value is 256 KB. The value must be between 1 KB and 256 KB.
    - **Content Based Deduplication**: This setting is only available for FIFO queues. Enable content based deduplication if the message body is guaranteed to be unique for each message. A unique hash value is generated from the body of each message, which is used as its deduplication ID. This avoids the need to set a deduplication ID when sending messages.

8. Click **Create queue** to finish.

You are returned to the **Queues** tab, where your newly-created queue now displays. You can view its URL here, for use in your API/CLI operations. Go further by clicking on the queue's name to access its **Settings** page and see additional information such as its ARN (Amazon Resource Name) and configuration parameters.

### How to send and receive messages

All further actions related to sending messages to queues can be done via a supported CLI or SDK. See our documentation on the [SQS CLI and SDKs](/serverless/messaging/reference-content/sqs-overview#further-actions) for more information. You can also check out [our tutorial](/tutorials/create-serverless-scraping/) on creating a serverless scraping architecture with Scaleway Messaging and Queuing SQS queues.

    <Message type="tip">
    If you do not currently have any credentials, topics or queues created for SQS, you will not be able to access the Settings tab. Temporarily create credentials or a queue, in order to access the Settings tab. Then, proceed with the steps below to deactivate the protocol.
    </Message>

5. In the bottom panel, click the **Deactivate SQS** button.

   A popup displays, reminding you that any existing SQS resources you have will be permanently deleted, and that you will not be able to create any new queues or credentials unless you reactivate the protocol.

6. Click **Deactivate SQS** to confirm.

<Message type="note">
SQS must be deactivated on a region-by-region basis. If you have activated SQS in other [regions](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region), and you also want to deactivate those, repeat the process above to deactivate the protocol in each one.
</Message>

## Quickstart for SNS

    <Tabs id="messaging-subscription-protocol">
        <TabsTab label="HTTP">
          <br />
          Select **HTTP** to create a subscription for a service or web server that can receive `HTTP POST` requests from SNS, via standard HTTP protocol.

          Note that for security reasons, we recommend using the HTTPS protocol, rather than HTTP.

          You are prompted to enter the URL of the HTTP endpoint to subscribe, e.g. `example.com`. Note that the scheme (`http://`) is not required.

          After your HTTP subscription is created, you must confirm it. Find out how in our [dedicated documentation](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-subscriptions/#how-to-confirm-an-http-or-https-subscription).

        </TabsTab>
        <TabsTab label="HTTPS">
          <br />
          Select **HTTPS** to create a subscription for a service or web server that can receive `HTTP POST` requests from SNS, via secure HTTP protocol.

          You are prompted to enter the URL of the HTTP endpoint to subscribe, e.g. `example.com`. Note that the scheme (`https://`) is not required.

          After your HTTP subscription is created, you must confirm it. Find out how in our [dedicated documentation](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-subscriptions/#how-to-confirm-an-http-or-https-subscription).

          You are prompted to select the **namespace** containing the Function or Container that you want to subscribe. Only namespaces in the same [Project](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project) and [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) as the SNS topic can be selected.

          You are prompted to select the Serverless Function or Container to subscribe. Only Functions and Containers with a public [privacy policy](/serverless/functions/concepts/#privacy-policy) can subscribe to an SNS topic.
        </TabsTab>
    </Tabs>

7. Click **Create subscription** to finish.

    The subscription is created. If you created an HTTP or HTTPS subscription, you will now need to [confirm it](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-subscriptions/#how-to-confirm-an-http-or-https-subscription). This step is not required for Serverless Functions or Containers subscriptions.

### How to publish messages

All further actions related to publishing messages to topics can be done via a supported CLI or SDK. See our documentation on the [SNS CLI and SDKs](/serverless/messaging/reference-content/sns-overview#further-actions)for more information.

      The generated credentials are displayed only once. Make sure to download and safely store them before closing the window.
    </Message>

7. Click **Download** and save the file, before closing the window.

    You are returned to your namespace's overview page. The name of your newly-generated credentials and their access level is displayed in the **Credentials** panel.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-nats-credentials-display.webp" alt="" />


### How to create and manage queues, messages and streams

All further actions related to publishing, processing and managing messages, subjects, queues and streams can be done via a supported CLI or SDK. See our documentation on [NATS CLI and SDKs](/serverless/messaging/reference-content/nats-overview#further-actions:-nats-cli-and-nats-sdk) for more information. You can also check out our tutorial on [creating a serverless architecture for handling large messages](/tutorials/large-messages/) with Scaleway Messaging and Queuing NATS.

### How to delete a NATS account

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of Messaging and Queuing protocols displays.
