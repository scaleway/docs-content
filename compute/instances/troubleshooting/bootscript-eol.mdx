Certain older legacy Instance types (e.g. **VC1-x**, **X64-x**, **Start1-x**, and **Stardust**) proposed the option to use a bootscript (a preconfigured boot configuration) to start your Instances. This option has become deprecated and will no longer be supported.
If you are still using one of these Instance types, you have to change your boot configuration in order to maintain your Instance operational.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)

## Migration options for Instances using bootscripts

### Instance using bootscript method and an old OS image without UEFI

The following options apply to most of the existing **VC1-x**, **X64-x**, **Start1-x**, and **Stardust** Instances.

<Message type="important">
  Local volume(s) not supporting UEFI cannot be used to boot any other type of Instance. You have to retrieve your data and manually migrate it to a Instance supporting UEFI boot. There is no way on Scaleway side to identify which customer is using OS image with / without UEFI partition. Only the user can find out looking into his volume.

#### Option 1: Create a unified snapshot of the volume(s) and rebuild block volume(s) from the snapshot

1. [Create a snapshot](/compute/instances/how-to/create-a-snapshot/) of the volume using the **unified** snapshot type.
2. [Create a new block volume](/storage/block/how-to/create-a-volume) from the previous unified snapshot.
3. [Create and start](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) a new Instance using its own boot volume in local boot mode.
4. [Attach](/storage/block/how-to/attach-a-volume/) the block volume to the new Instance.
5. Once logged into the instance, [mount the partition](/storage/block/how-to/mount-and-use-volume/) available in the block volume and access your data.
6. Delete the old Instance that was using a bootscript once the migration is completed.

#### Option 2: Create a unified snapshot of the volume(s) and export it to S3 to retrieve the data

1. [Create a snapshot](/compute/instances/how-to/create-a-snapshot/) of the volume using the **unified** or **l_ssd** type of snapshot.
2. [Export](/compute/instances/how-to/snapshot-import-export-feature) the snapshot to a S3 bucket in the same region as the Instance.
3. Retrieve your data from the Object Storage bucket and reuse them at your convenience.
4. Delete the old Instance that was using a bootscript once you have recovered your data.

#### Option 3: Create a new Instance using local boot method and manually copy data from the old instance to the new one.

[Migrate the data](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/migrate-server/) of your old instance manually. For example using FTP, SCP or Rsync.

<Message type="important">
  Old volumes (prior 2018) which include QCOW backing chains are currently not supported in the unified snapshot / snapshot transfer logic. For volumes using backing chains, options 1 and 2 are not applicable.

### Instance using bootscript method and an OS image with UEFI

#### Option 4: Change the boot type of the Instance to local boot

[Change the boot type](/compute/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes/#how-to-use-local-boot) of the Instance to **Local boot**.

1. [Stop](/compute/instances/how-to/power-off-instance/) or [pause](/compute/instances/how-to/use-standby-mode/) the Instance.
2. [Change the boot type](/compute/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes/#how-to-use-local-boot) to local boot.
3. Start or resume execution of the Instance.
4. Check that the instance is booting correctly with the local boot method and that his services are behaving correctly.

<Message type="tip">
  If changing the boot type from bootscript to local boot is not successful by using option 4, you can always use option 1, 2 or 3 to migrate your Instance data to a new one.
</Message>

<Message type="tip">
  If you are a Stardust user, we recommend you to stop the VM from the a VM shell so that the VM itself is in `stopped_in_place` state. This ensures your Instance will not lose its slot due to availability shortages.
