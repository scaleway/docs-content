Each Scaleway Elastic Metal server is configured with a single physical Network Interface Card (NIC), pre-configured by default. This NIC handles both public internet traffic and private network communication, sharing the total available bandwidth.

## Private Networks

Private Networks are an optional feature that can be enabled per server. For each attached private network, a dedicated VLAN with a private IP is created on the NIC. This setup enables secure, isolated communication between Elastic Metal servers and other resources (e.g. Instances, Load Balancer's) within the same Private Network.

## Public bandwidth and flexible IPs

Public bandwidth on Elastic Metal servers is limited by default and typically lower than the maximum capacity of the NIC. It may be increased depending on your server plan and configuration.

A public IPv4 is provided by default with each Elastic Metal server, it is configured by default on the machine after OS installation from the Scaleway console. If you decide to manually install your OS you can the OS let it configure automatically using DHCP.
The default IPv4 is statically assigned to the physical machine and can not be moved to another Elastic Metal server

### Flexible IPs

Flexible IPs are IPs that are unrelated to to the physical machine and can be assigned flexible to your Elastic Metal resources. Flexible IPs can either be a IPv4 (/32 subnet - one IPv4 address) or an IPv6 subnet (/64 subnet).

There are two scenarios for additional Flexible IPs:

* Without virtualization: Assign the additional IP directly to the host OS interface. No virtual MAC or interface is required.
* With virtualization: A virtual interface must be added to the network interface using an hypervisor (e.g. QEMU/KVM), and attached to a single virtual MAC address.

### Flexible IPv6

Scaleway supports flexible IPv6 addresses on Elastic Metal servers. These operate similarly to flexible IPv4 addresses and must also be manually configured.

## KVM public IP

The KVM public IP is the IP address used to access the KVM-over-IP device of the machine.
This IP address is used to provide remote access to the server in case the machine can't be reached anymore on the public IP or to install a custom OS using the KVM over IP device. It is configured on the same physical NIC but is not visible from the OS.
The KVM public IP uses a special connection handled by the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) and Scaleway's internal network.
