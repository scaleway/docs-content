## What is InterLink and how does it work?

InterLink is Scaleway's product to let you create a secure, private connection between your external infrastructure, and your Scaleway VPC. This allows you to direct your traffic safely from your Scaleway infrastructure to your on-premises infrastructure, away from the public internet.

Two types of InterLink are available: **hosted InterLink** where the physical connection is facilitated via a partner, or **self-hosted InterLink** where the customer provisions their own dedicated physical connection.

At its simplest level, InterLink can be understood as a configurable connection between your own infrastructure, and your Scaleway VPC. You can configure details such as bandwidth, the VPC to connect to, and routing policies.

## How can I find a partner to provision my hosted InterLink?

To establish a hosted InterLink via a partner, generally you must be a client of that partner, e.g. with your infrastructure in their data center, or on your own premises using the partner as a network provider. For more details, see our [information on choosing a partner](/interlink/reference-content/overview/#hosted-interlinks).

You can see available partners in the Scaleway console by opening the [InterLink order form](https://console.scaleway.com/interlink/links/order). More partners will be added to Scaleway InterLink as time goes on.

## I want to create a dedicated InterLink without a partner, how can I do this?

You can create a **self-hosted** InterLink, provisioning your own physical connection without a partner, getting sole use of a single InterLink port on Scaleway's router. You can then use the bandwidth of this connection to create several InterLinks just for you.

[Contact a sales representative](https://www.scaleway.com/en/contact-sales/) to register your interest in a self-hosted InterLink. The process of provisioning the dedicated physical connection must be done via our sales team, and cannot be achieved via the Scaleway console or developer tools.

## What are the benefits of using InterLink compared to other connectivity solutions?

InterLink allows you to connect your Scaleway VPC to your external infrastructure and bypass the public internet entirely. Compared to a typical internet-based VPN, an InterLink is more reliable, more secure and offers lower latency.
    
## How much does InterLink cost?
