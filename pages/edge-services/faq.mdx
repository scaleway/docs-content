## What is Edge Services?

Edge Services is a feature for Scaleway Load Balancers and Object Storage buckets. Creating Edge Services [pipelines](/edge-services/concepts/#pipeline) towards your Load Balancers or Object Storage buckets provides: 
-A [caching service](/edge-services/how-to/configure-cache/) to improve performance by reducing load on your [origin](/edge-services/concepts/#origin), and 
- A customizable and secure endpoint for accessing content via Edge Services, which can be set to a subdomain of your choice and secured with an SSL/TLS certificate.

The user connects to the customizable Edge Services endpoint (with its SSL/TLS certificate), which fetches content from the Edge Services cache, which itself fetches content to cache from an origin which is either an Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer" />

## Which products are compatible with Edge Services?

Edge Services is currently available for Scaleway [Object Storage buckets](/object-storage/) and Scaleway [Load Balancers](/load-balancer/).

## How much does Edge Services cost?

On November 1st 2024, Edge Services transitioned from Public Beta to General Availability, and became billable. Pricing is based on [monthly subscription plans](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/network/#edge-services): three plans are available, each allowing a fixed number of pipelines, and a certain amount of egress cache data. Any consumption that exceeds the limits of the plan is charged at an additional rate.

Find out more about how Edge Service subscription plans and billing works on our [Understanding Edge Services pricing](/edge-services/reference-content/understanding-pricing/) page.

## If I customize my Edge Services endpoint with my own domain, can it serve content over HTTPS?

Yes, if you choose to [customize your Edge Services endpoint with your own subdomain](/edge-services/how-to/configure-custom-domain/), you are prompted to generate or upload an SSL/TLS certificate for that subdomain so that Edge Services can serve content over HTTPS. This certificate can either be a Let's Encrypt certificate generated and managed by Scaleway, or you can import your own certificate. If you import your own certificate, it will be stored in Scaleway Secret Manager, and [billed accordingly](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/security-and-account/).

## What is WAF?

**W**eb **A**pplication **F**irewall is currently available in Public Beta via Edge via the [Edge Services API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/edge-services/) only. It will be coming to the Scaleway console soon.

When enabled, WAF filters requests to your Load Balancer origin or Object Storage bucket to determine whether they are potentially malicious. You can choose the [paranoia level](/edge-services/concepts/#paranoia-level) to be used when evaluating requests, and set [exclusions](/edge-services/concepts/#exclusions) to define traffic that shouldn't be filtered by WAF. Requests that are judged to be malicious are blocked or logged, depending on the settings you choose. Find out more about WAF in our [detailed documentation](/edge-services/reference-content/understanding-waf/).
