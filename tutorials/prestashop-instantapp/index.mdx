## Configuring PrestaShop

When your server is running, the server's IP address is available in the server list on the control panel.

Connect to it, by using SSH, to recover the database password for your PrestaShop.
Once you are connected to your server, the following message appear on your screen:

Save your password, as you will need it in the next step.

<Message type="important">

The installation of PrestaShop may take a few minutes. If no password is shown, disconnect from the instance and reconnect to it a few minutes later.
