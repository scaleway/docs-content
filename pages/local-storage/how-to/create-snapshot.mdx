The snapshot feature allows you to create an image of a specific Local Storage volume of your Instance. A snapshot is a full-volume copy stored in our secure data centers. They are usually used to recover volume data or to create a copy of a volume.

<Message type="tip">
  * This documentation refers to the creation of snapshots for Local Storage volumes. Refer to [How to create a snapshot of a Block Storage volume](/block-storage/how-to/create-a-snapshot/) to find information on how to create snapshots of Block Storage volumes.
  * The snapshot feature creates backups of specific volumes only. If you wish to create a backup image that is a complete backup of your Instance including **all** of its volumes, check out our documentation on [how to create an image](/instances/how-to/create-a-backup/).

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An [Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/)

## How to create a snapshot

1. Click **Local Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The [Local Storage overview](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) displays.
2. Click the **Snapshots** tab.
3. Click the **+ Create snapshot** button. You are directed to the snapshot creation wizard.
4. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Choose a **name** for the snapshot, or use the default suggested name.
    - Select the **volume** you wish to snapshot. All of your Instances' volumes will be shown on the drop-down list, grouped by Availability Zone.
    - Check the **Estimated cost**.
5. Click **Create snapshot** to finish. You are redirected to the **Snapshots** tab, where your new snapshot now appears in the list.

## How to create a volume from a snapshot

You can create a [volume](/instances/concepts/#volumes) from a snapshot as follows:

1. Click **Local Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The [Local Storage page](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) displays.
2. Click the **Snapshots** tab.
3. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the snapshot you want to create an image from. A drop-down menu displays.
4. Click **Volume from snapshot**. A pop-up displays.
5. Enter a name for the volume (or use the default suggested name) and click **Create volume from Snapshot**.

    The volume is created, and displays in the list of your Local Storage volumes. Check out our documentation on [attaching volumes](/block-storage/how-to/attach-a-volume/) and [mounting volumes](/block-storage/api-cli/managing-a-volume/#mounting-and-using-a-block-storage-volume) to learn how to use the volume with your Instances.

## How to create an Instance from a snapshot

Follow the instructions for [creating an Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/). At the **Choose an image** step of the creation wizard, click the **My snapshots** tab, and select the desired snapshot.
