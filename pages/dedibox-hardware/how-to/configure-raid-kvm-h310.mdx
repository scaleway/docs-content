The personalized RAID configuration allows you to create a RAID mode that cannot be created via the management console of Online.net (RAID10, for example).
<Macro id="requirements" />
- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- A [Dedibox dedicated server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/) with a DELL PERC H310 / H700 / H710 / H730-P / LSI9361 RAID controller
1. Click **Server** > **Server list** to display the list of your servers. Click the identifier of the server you want to configure. The server information page displays.
2. Click **IDRAC** in the menu on the right and validate the terms. Then enter your connection's IP address and click **CREATE**. Your iDRAC session credentials display. Login to iDRAC using the credentials shown.
3. The iDRAC dashboard displays. Click **Launch** in the **Virtual Console Preview** section to launch the KVM-over-IP applet.
    Use the HTML5 version of the KVM-over-IP applet, if available, to avoid potential security risks associated with Java. If the HTML5 version is not available, use the Java-based applet.
    <Message type="warning">
      **Security Warning:** Using the Java-based KVM-over-IP applet may pose security risks. Set your Java security settings to **low** to avoid connection problems, but be aware of the potential risks.
