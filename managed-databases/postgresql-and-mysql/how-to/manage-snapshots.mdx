[Snapshots](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/manage-snapshots/) allow you to restore data in a new Database Instance, instead of creating individual automated database backups. It is only available for Database Instances that use Block Storage volumes.

When you set up [autobackups](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/enable-autobackup/) for Database Instances that use Block Storage, the automatic backups are created in snapshot format.

You can have up to 100 snapshots per Instance and project (depending on quotas).

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [PostgreSQL or MySQL Database Instance](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/quickstart)

## How to create snapshots

1. Go to the **Snapshots** tab of your Database Instance of choice.
2. Click **+ Create snapshot**.
    <Message type="important">
      Make sure your Instance is in `READY` state before creating a snapshot.
    </Message>
    A pop-up displays.
3. Enter a name for your snapshot and set up the expiration date and time.
    <Message type="note">
      The default retention period for snapshots is 365 days.
    </Message>
4. Click **Create snapshot** to confirm.

## How to create a Database Instance from a snapshot

You can restore the data contained in a snapshot to a Database Instance. When you do so, a new Database Instance is created and billed to your account.

1. Go to the **Snapshots** tab of your Database Instance of choice.
2. Click the <Icon name="more" /> next to the name of the snapshot.
3. Click **Create Database Instance from snapshot**. A pop-up appears.
4. Enter a name for your new Instance.
5. Choose a node type and configuration.
    <Message type="important">
      It is possible to select a different (larger or smaller) node type for your new Instance. However, the block volume size will be the same as the size of the restored snapshot. All Instance settings will be restored if you chose a node type with the same or more memory size than the initial Instance. Settings will be reset to the default if your node type has less memory.
    </Message>
6. Click **Create Database Instance** to confirm.

    You can see the new Instance in your Database Instances list.

## How to delete snapshots

When you delete an Instance, its associated snapshots are not deleted. Snapshots can be manually deleted or will be deleted after the retention period defined.

If you do not wish to wait for the snapshot to expire, you can delete it manually.

1. Go to the **Snapshots** tab of your Database Instance of choice.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the name of the snapshot.
3. Click **Delete**. A pop-up displays to warn you that:
    <Message type="important">
      This action is irreversible and will permanently destroy your snapshot and all its data.
    </Message>
4. Type **DELETE** and click **Delete snapshot** if you wish to continue.
