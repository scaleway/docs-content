When you attach a resource to a Private Network, the Private Network's built in DHCP defines an IPv4 and IPv6 address for the resource on that network. This is managed via Scaleway's [internal IPAM](/network/vpc/concepts/#ipam).

However, in some cases an IP address may not be set for your resource on the Private Network. Read on below to find out more about this problem, and how to solve it.

## No IP address is displayed and I have not activated DHCP

You may have attached a resource to an "old" Private Network on which you [have not activated DHCP](/network/vpc/reference-content/vpc-migration/#dhcp-activation-on-pre-existing-private-networks). In this case, no IP address for the resource on the network is configured.

You will need to carry out manual configuration to set the IP address on the resource, or [activate DHCP](/network/vpc/how-to/activate-dhcp/). 

We strongly recommend that you activate DHCP on the Private Network to let us automatically handle IP address management.

Read our dedicated documentation about [VPC migration](/network/vpc/reference-content/vpc-migration/) for more information about how "old" Private Networks are migrated to the VPC, including DHCP activation.

## No IP address is displayed but I have activated DHCP

This may be because the resource was attached to the Private Network some time ago, before the product was integrated with IPAM. Therefore, no address is reserved with the IPAM for the resource on this Private Network.

To fix this problem, **detach your resource from the Private Network, and reattach it.**
