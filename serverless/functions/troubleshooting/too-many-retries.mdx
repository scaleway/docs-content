## Problem

My function fails, and the following message displays:

```
Too many retries, sub-runtime server did not come up in 10ms seconds
```

## Cause

This error is returned by the runtime when it cannot process the request. It has several different origins.

## Possible solutions

- Make sure that you have only imported the required dependencies and not the complete libraries.

- Avoid performing too many initialization operations.

- Update your function's resources by provisioning more memory and more vCPU.
