Scaleway Edge Services is leaving Public Beta and going into General Availability. Read on to find out more about when this will happen, what it means for current users, and how the product will be billed.

## Edge Services Public Beta

Edge Services for Object Storage and Load Balancer is currently in Public Beta. This means that the product is ready to be tested by customers, but some features may be missing, and usage is intended for test environments rather than production. Edge Services is free to use during Public Beta, and is not billed.

## Edge Services General Availability

From **November 1st 2024** Edge Services will transition to General Availability, for both Object Storage and Load Balancer usage. This means that:
- We consider that the product is ready for production environments.
- The product will no longer be free to use, and will be billed. 

## Edge Services pricing

<Message type="note">
Check out the [Edge Services pricing page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/network/#edge-services) for full pricing details.
</Message>

Once in General Availability, Edge Services will be billed via **subscription**. Three different subscription plans will be available, each including different amounts of monthly usage for **cache size** and **number of pipelines**. If your consumption of Edge Services in a given month exceeds the cache size and number of pipelines included in your subscription, you will be billed for this extra usage on top of your plan.

<Message type="tip">
An Edge Services pipeline consists of an origin for which Edge Services requests and caches content, and an endpoint from which this content is served via Edge Services. In the case of Object Storage, a pipeline corresponds to a bucket Edge Services is enabled on. If Edge Services is enabled on three different buckets, this equals three pipelines. In the case of Load Balancer, pipelines are already an explicit concept in the console.

At the start of October 2024, current Edge Services users will receive an email with full details of the three subscription plans.

Pricing plan details can also be viewed on the [Scaleway pricing page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/network/).

## Transitioning from free to paid use

At the end of October 2024, we will automatically select the most cost-effective subscription plan for each existing Edge Services user, based on their current usage. When billing starts on the 1st of November 2024, you will therefore see in the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) that you are subscribed to the plan we have selected for you.

Billing for Edge Services is pro-rata, and you can cancel or change your subscription plan at any time. 

<Message type="important">
If you do not wish to be billed for Edge Services, you must disable it on all your buckets, and delete any Load Balancer pipelines you had created **before November 1st 2024**. See the documentation on how to [disable or delete Edge Services](/network/edge-services/how-to/delete-pipeline/).

### How can I estimate how much I'll be charged?

To estimate your billing for Edge Services, calculate:

- **How many Edge Services pipelines you are using** (see tip [above](#edg-services-pricing)).
- **How much cache you are using** (this information can be found via [Scaleway Cockpit](/network/edge-services/how-to/monitor-cockpit/))

Cross reference the above information with the details given on the [pricing page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/network/). Remember, we'll automatically transfer you to the most cost-effective plan for your usage, and any extra usage above that plan will be billed additionally according to the rates shown.
