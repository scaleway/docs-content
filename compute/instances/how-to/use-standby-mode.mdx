[Standby mode](/compute/instances/concepts/#stand-by-mode) temporarily stops an Instance. The Instance remains allocated to your account and all data remains on the local storage of the Instance.

    Your Instance is now in standby mode.

<Message type="important">
  You are still billed for an Instance in standby mode, as well as for its storage and any flexible IPs attached to it. To avoid being charged for an unused Instance, you can [power it off](/compute/instances/how-to/power-off-instance/). <br /><br />
