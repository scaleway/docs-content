Ephemeral secrets are now available on the Secret Manager API.

Upon creation, secrets can now be configured with a time-to-live or to expire after a single access through an ephemeral policy. If applied on a secret, all its versions will inherit from the policy.

Refer to the [Secret Manager API documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/secret-manager) for more information.
