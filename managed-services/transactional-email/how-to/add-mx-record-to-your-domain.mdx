## How to add an MX record using Scaleway's MX server

<Message type="important">
  Scaleway provides its own MX server to improve email deliverability. However, Scaleway's MX server is a **blackhole**. This means that **any email sent back to it, will be lost with no possibility of recovery**.
</Message>

1. Add an [MX record](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#mx-record) type in the root zone of your domain on your DNS zone.
2. Enter a name of your choice in the **Name** field.
3. Set `0` as a [priority](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#priority) for your MX record.
    <Message type="note">
     Priority indicates the order in which your mail servers should be tried by a mail server that is attempting to deliver emails.
     The lowest number indicates the server with the highest priority. A `0` represents the highest priority possible.
    </Message>
4. Enter `blackhole.scw-tem.cloud` in the **Hostname** field.
5. Save your changes.

    <Message type="important">
    Your changes might take up to 48 hours to apply.
    </Message>

## How to add a null MX record

2. Enter `.` in the **Hostname** field.
3. Set the priority to `0`.
