    </Message>
8. Check that all information you entered is correct on the installation summary tab.

    Once the installation completes, your server will reboot on its hard disk.

<Message type="note">
  Depending on the OS, the installation may take several minutes to complete. Certain operating systems may require additional reboots for completion. We recommend waiting 45 to 60 minutes before you connect to your server.

## How to connect to your server

A common way of connecting to your Dedibox server is via the command line, using SSH. SSH is a secure communication protocol, which imposes an encryption key exchange at the beginning of the connection. This means that the exchange of data between the client and the server will be encrypted.

However, you may also connect to your server via a graphical interface such as Windows Remote Desktop.

You can also use FTP, SFTP or SCP to transfer data to and from your server.

  - You have [created](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/order-a-server) and [installed](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/install-a-server) a dedicated server, and transferred your SSH key to the server during installation

## How to connect via SSH 

### From OSX (Mac) and Linux

1. Open a terminal program on your local machine.
2. Enter the command below into the terminal. Make sure you replace `your_private_key` with the filename of your private key (often `id_rsa`) and `your_server_ip` with the IP address of your server.
    ```bash
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_private_key root@your_server_ip
    ```
3. If / when prompted, allow connection to the host by typing `yes`, then press **Enter**.
    ```
    The authenticity of host 'myhost.ext (212.47.226.35)' cannot be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is 4f:ba:65:cf:14:64:a7:1e:b6:07:7c:00:71:95:21:fa.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
    ```

### From Windows

To connect to your server from Windows, you will need to use a small application called **PuTTy**, an SSH client.

To connect to your Instance from Windows, you will need to use a small application called **PuTTY**, an SSH client.
