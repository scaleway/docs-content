Created by Upbound, [Crossplane](https://www.crossplane.io/) is a Kubernetes-based platform that allows you to manage resources through a unified control plane. `crossplane-provider-scaleway` is a Crossplane provider that helps you manage Scaleway cloud resources in Kubernetes. It is built using [Upjet](https://github.com/upbound/upjet) code generation tools and it exposes managed resources for Scaleway that adhere to Crossplane's eXtensible Resource Model (XRM). As a model, XRM ensures that users can easily and consistently manage cloud resources across different cloud providers.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to install Upbound Universal Crossplane (UXP) into your Kubernetes cluster, configure the provider to authenticate with Scaleway, and create a Scaleway [Kubernetes](/containers/kubernetes/quickstart/) managed resource directly from your cluster.

## Installing the Up command-line

Run the following command to download and install the Upbound `up` command-line interface:

    ```
    curl -sL "https://cli.upbound.io" | sh
    sudo mv up /usr/local/bin/
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      This tutorial uses `curl` but other command-line tools are available. You can refer to the [official Upbound documentation](https://docs.upbound.io/cli/#install-the-up-command-line) for more information.
    </Message>

## Installing Upbound Universal Crossplane

Open a terminal and run the following `up uxp install` command to install [Upbound Universal Crossplane (UXP)](https://docs.upbound.io/uxp/). You should an output similar to the following:

    ```
    UXP 1.9.0-up.3 installed
    ```

## Installing the provider into your Kubernetes cluster

1. Run the following command to create a `.kube` directory in which you will store your `kubeconfig` file:

    ```
    mkdir .kube
    ```

2. Run the following command to open the `config` file in your `.kube` directory. The file should be empty.

    ```
    nano .kube/config
    ```

3. Paste the content of your Kubeconfig file and save the changes by following the information displayed on your terminal. Here is an example on a Mac terminal screen.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubeconfig-terminal-screen.webp" alt="" />

4. Run the following command to install the provider into the Kubernetes cluster using the previously set Kubernetes configuration file.

    ```
    cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
    apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1
    kind: Provider
    metadata:
      name: provider-scaleway
    spec:
      package: xpkg.upbound.io/scaleway/provider-scaleway:v0.1.0
    EOF
    ```

    You should get an output similar to the following:

    ```
    provider.pkg.crossplane.io/provider-scaleway Created
    ```

5. Run the following command to verify whether the provider has been properly installed.

    ```
    kubectl get providers
    ```

    You should get an output similar to the following, with the value for `installed` returning `True`:

    ```
    NAME                INSTALLED   HEALTHY   PACKAGE                                             AGE
    provider-scaleway   True        True   xpkg.upbound.io/scaleway/provider-scaleway:v0.1.0        11s
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      The procedure may take up to 5 minutes for `HEALTHY` to report `True`.
    </Message>

    <Message type="tip">
      If the `INSTALLED` field is empty, it means the process of downloading and installing the provider has failed. Run `kubectl describe providers` to get more information.
    </Message>

## Creating a Kubernetes secret resource for Scaleway

The provider requires credentials to create and manage Scaleway resources.

1. Run the following command to create a `secret.yaml` file in which your Kubernetes secret configuration will be stored:

    ```
    nano secret.yaml
    ```

2. Edit the request payload you will use to create your Kubernetes secret configuration file. Replace the parameters in the following example using the information in the configuration reference table:

    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: name-of-secret
      namespace: crossplane-system
    type: Opaque
    stringData:
      credentials: |
        {
          "access_key": "SCWXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
          "secret_key": "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
          "project_id": "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
          "region": "fr-par",
          "zone": "fr-par-1"
        }
    ```

    <Message type="important">
      Secret names must be a valid DNS subdomain, meaning they must consist of lowercase alphanumeric characters, hyphens ("-") or periods and must start and end with an alphanumeric character. Underscores ("_") are not permitted.
    </Message>

3. Paste the content of the request payload and save the changes by following the information displayed on your terminal.

4. Run the following command to create the secret previously defined in the secret.yaml file.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f secret.yaml
    ```

    You should get an output similar to the following:

    ```
    secret/name-of-secret created
    ```

5. Run the following command to create a `crossplane-system` [namespace](/containers/container-registry/concepts/#namespace):

    ```
    kubectl create namespace crossplane-system --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
    ```

    You should get an output similar to the following:

    ```
    namespace/crossplane-system created
    ```

6. Run the following command to retrieve details about your secret:

    ```
    kubectl describe secret -n crossplane-system
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      As the information is considered sensitive, the actual secret data will not be returned.
    </Message>

## Creating a providerconfig file

Create a `.yaml` configuration file to attach your Scaleway credentials to the previously installed provider.

1. Run the following command to create a `providerconfig` file:

    ```
    nano providerconfig
    ```

2. Edit the request payload you will use to create your `providerconfig` file. Replace the parameters in the following example using the information in the configuration reference table:

    ```
    apiVersion: scaleway.upbound.io/v1beta1
    kind: ProviderConfig
    metadata:
      name: default
    spec:
      credentials:
      source: Secret
      secretRef:
        name: name-of-secret
        namespace: crossplane-system
        key: credentials
    ```

3. Paste the content of the request payload and save the changes by following the information displayed on your terminal.

4. Run the following command to apply the previously set configuration to the secret. Make sure to replace the example file path with your own.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f /users/FileName/providerconfig
    ```

    You should get an output similar to the following:

    ```
    providerconfig.scaleway.upbound.io/default created
    ```

5. Run the following command to verify whether contents of the file have been applied to the Kubernetes cluster.

    ```
    kubectl describe providerconfigs
    ```

    You should get an output similar to the following:

    ```

### Configuration reference table

| Parameter   | Description                                |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| `namespace` | The Kubernetes namespace the secret is in. |
| `name`      | The name of the Kubernetes secret object.  |

### Creating a managed resource

1. Run the following command to create a Scaleway Object Storage bucket:

    ```
    nano bucket.yaml
    ```
2. Paste the following example and save the changes by following the information displayed on your terminal:

    ```
    apiVersion: object.scaleway.upbound.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Bucket
    metadata:
      name: object-bucket
    spec:
      forProvider:
        name: crossplane-object-bucket
      providerConfigRef:
        name: default
    ```

3. Run the following command to apply the previously set configuration to the bucket. Make sure to replace the example file path with your own.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f bucket.yaml
    ```

    You should get an output similar to the following:

    ```
    bucket.object.scaleway.upbound.io/object-bucket created
    ```

4. Run the following command to retrieve details on your newly created bucket:

    ```
    kubectl get buckets
    ```

    An output similar to the following should display, with the values for `READY` and `SYNCED` returning `True`:

    ```
    NAME                           READY   SYNCED   EXTERNAL-NAME                     AGE
    object-bucket                  True    True     fr-par/crossplane-object-bucket   9s
    ```

## Deleting a managed resource

1. Run the following command to delete the bucket you just created:

    ```
    kubectl delete -f bucket.yaml
    ```

    You should get an output similar to this, confirming the bucket deletion:

    ```
    bucket.object.scaleway.upbound.io "object-bucket" deleted
    ```

2. Run the following command to verify whether the bucket was properly deleted:

    ```
    kubectl get buckets
    ```

    You should get an output similar to the following:

    ```
    No resources found
    ```
