This page provides information about the different DNS record types available with Domains and DNS and how to use them.


Information in DNS zones is categorized and organized through a list of [DNS record](/network/domains-and-dns/concepts/#dns-record) types, called [resource records](/network/domains-and-dns/concepts/#resource-record/) (RRs).

Each of these records has a type, an expiration time (Time to Live - TTL) and a name. Certain types of records also have type-specific data.

The available records are:

* **A record**: Address record, mostly used to map domain names to the IPv4 address of a specific server
* **AAAA record**: IPv6 Address record, returns an IPv6 address and is mostly used to map domain names to the IPv6 address of a specific server.
* **ALIAS record**: Alias record, maps a name to another name. It is similar to CNAME records but can coexist with other records on that name. It can be used if you want to map one name to another, and you do not need other record types (for example: MX records for emails) for the same name.
* **CAA record**: Certification Authority Authorization record, used to set the certificate authorities (CAs) which are allowed to issue certificates for the domain name.
* **CNAME record**: Canonical name record, an alias of one name to another. The DNS lookup will continue by looking up the new name.
* **DNAME record**: Delegation name record, used to redirect from a part of the DNS name tree to another part of the DNS name tree.
* **MX record**: Mail exchange record, maps a domain name to a list of one or more mail servers for that domain.
* **NAPTR record**:
* **NS record**: Name server record, delegates a DNS zone to use the specified authoritative name servers.
* **SRV record**: Service record, provides a specification of location data in the Domain Name System (for example: the hostname and port number of servers for specified services). It can be used for specific protocols such as SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)
* **TLSA record**: TLS Authentication record, used to associate a TLS certificate or public key with the specified domain name. It allows you store the fingerprint of a TLS/SSL certificate in the DNS zone of your domain.
* **TXT record**: Text record, often used to carry machine-readable data such as information for automated domain validation.
