This page shows how to manage [credentials](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#namespace) for a [Messaging and Queuing namespace](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#namespace). Credentials for an SQS/SNS namespace can be updated to change their permissions, or revoked. Credentials for a NATS namespace can only be revoked, not updated. Once credentials are revoked, any user trying to use the credentials to connect to the Messaging and Queuing namespace will be denied.

    - For NATS credentials, click the <Icon name="delete" /> button next to the relevant credentials to revoke them
    - For SQS/SNS credentials, click the <Icon name="more" /> button next to the relevant credentials, and select **Revoke** from the drop-down menu.
