AI-driven coding is revolutionizing software development by automating repetitive tasks, generating code snippets, improving code quality, and identifying potential bugs. 
By integrating AI-powered tools, developers can significantly enhance productivity and optimize workflows. 
This guide will help you integrate AI-powered code models into JetBrain's IntelliJ IDEA using Continue and Scaleway’s Generative APIs.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) for API authentication
- Installed [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) on your local machine.

## Install Continue in IntelliJ IDEA

You can install Continue from the [JetBrains marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22707-continue):

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA and go to **Preferences** (`Ctrl+Alt+S` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+,` on macOS).
2. Navigate to **Plugins**, then click **Marketplace**.
3. Search for **Continue** and click **Install**.
4. Restart IntelliJ IDEA after installation.

### Configure Continue to use Scaleway’s Generative APIs

#### Configure Continue through the graphical interface

To link Continue with Scaleway's Generative APIs, you can use built-in menus from Continue in IntelliJ IDEA.

- Click **Continue** in the menu on the right. .
- In the prompt section, click on **Select model** dropdown, then on **Add Chat model**.
- Select **Scaleway** as provider.
- Select the model you want to use (we recommend `Qwen 2.5 Coder 32b` to get started with).
- Enter your **Scaleway secret key**.
    <Message type="tip">
     To start with, we recommend you use a Scaleway secret key having access to your `default` Scaleway project.
    </Message>

These actions will edit automatically your `config.json` file. To edit it manually, see [Configure Continue through configuration file](#configure-continue-through-configuration-file).

<Message type="note">
  Embeddings and autocomplete models are not yet supported through graphical interface configuration. To enable them, you need to edit the configuration manually, see [Configure Continue through configuration file](#configure-continue-through-configuration-file).
</Message>

#### Configure Continue through configuration file

To link Continue with Scaleway’s Generative APIs, you need to configure the settings file:

1. Locate your Continue configuration directory:
   - **Linux/macOS**: `~/.continue/`
   - **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.continue\`
2. Create a `config.json` file inside this directory.
3. Add the following configuration:
    ```json
    {
    "models": [
        {
        "model": "qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct",
        "title": "Qwen2.5 Coder",
        "provider": "scaleway",
        "apiKey": "###SCW_SECRET_KEY###"
        }
    ]
    }
    ```
4. Save the file and restart IntelliJ IDEA.

<Message type="tip">
  For more details on configuring `config.json`, refer to the [official Continue documentation](https://docs.continue.dev/reference).
  If you want to limit access to a specific Scaleway Project, you should add the field `"apiBase": "https://api.scaleway.ai/###PROJECT_ID###/v1/"` for each model (ie. `models`, `embeddingsProvider` and `tabAutocompleteModel`) since the default URL `https://api.scaleway.ai/v1/` can only be used with the `default` project.

### Activate Continue in IntelliJ IDEA

After configuring the API, activate Continue in IntelliJ IDEA:

- Open the **Command Search** (Press`Shift` twice quickly on Windows/Linux/macOS).
- Type `"Continue"` and select the appropriate command to enable AI-powered assistance.

<Message type="important">
  Enabling tab completion **may lead to higher token consumption** as the model generates predictions for every keystroke. Be mindful of your API usage and adjust settings accordingly to avoid unexpected costs. For more information, refer to the [official Continue documentation](https://docs.continue.dev/reference#tabautocompleteoptions).
