This page explains why **Instance users** should migrate from the Instance API to the Block Storage API to create and manage block volumes and snapshots.

<Macro id="block-storage-no-migration-for-k8s" />

## Transitioning from the Instance API to the Block Storage API for volume and snapshot management

Scaleway is transitioning the management of all Block Storage volumes and snapshots from the [Instance API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/) to the [Block Storage API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/block/).

This change streamlines how storage resources are managed by consolidating them under the Block Storage API, providing enhanced management features and clearer storage class distinctions.

Local volumes will remain exclusively supported by the Instance API.

## What is required from you in the context of the migration?

If you have created volumes and snapshots via the Instance API, you **must transition to the Block Storage API** to align with the latest management practices.

This entails [migrating your existing volumes and snapshots to the Block Storage API](/compute/instances/how-to/migrate-volumes-snapshots-to-sbs/), and **switching to using only the Block Storage API for Block Storage volumes and snapshots creation and management**.

<Message type="important">
  Unified volume creation and management will no longer be available via the Block Storage API and will no longer be supported by the Instance API at the end of the migration. For this reason, it is also necessary to convert your existing unified volumes and snapshots to either local or block volumes.
</Message>

## What will happen at the end of the migration?

From **April 30th 2025, it will no longer be possible to create Block volumes through the Instance API**.

From **June 2nd, 2025, all block volumes and snapshots that you have not migrated manually will be automatically switched behind the Block Storage API**.

What's more, creating and managing block volumes and snapshots through the Instance API will no longer be possible. The Instance API will only allow you to create and manage local volumes and snapshots.

Creating and managing block volumes and snapshots will **only be available via the Block Storage API**.

## Differences between the Instance API and the Block Storage API

The key differences between the Instance API and the Block Storage API lie in the storage classes they manage, rather than just the APIs themselves. The [Block Storage API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/block/) is the only API to use to create and manage all types of volumes, including high performance ones.

### Storage classes

The Instance API handles only **BSSD (Basic SSD)** volumes.
The Block Storage API supports a broader range of storage classes, including:

  - **BSSD volumes**
  - **Scaleway Block Storage (SBS) 5K IOPS volumes**
  - **Scaleway Block Storage (SBS) 15K IOPS volumes**

### Underlying hardware

**BSSD volumes** (managed by both APIs) are built on **older-generation SSDs**, offering reliable performance but with limitations in speed and latency.

**Scaleway Block Storage 5K and 15K volumes** (managed only by the Block Storage API) are powered by **modern NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) disks**. They are optimized for **low-latency and high-speed operations**.

### Performance and latency

**BSSD volumes**:

  - **Performance**: Limited IOPS and slower data processing speed due to older SSD technology.
  - **Latency**: Higher latency, less suitable for applications requiring rapid data retrieval.

**Scaleway Block Storage 5K and 15K volumes**:

  - **Performance**: Enhanced performance with up to 5K IOPS (SBS 5K) and 15K IOPS (SBS 15K).
  - **Latency**: Lower latency, ideal for workloads demanding rapid and reliable data access.

## Why transition to the Block Storage API?

By transitioning to the Block Storage API, you align with Scaleway's consolidated storage management approach and gain access to advanced storage features and flexibility. While migrating to the Block Storage API does not inherently change the performance of BSSD volumes, you benefit from:

- **Unified management**: Simplified volume and snapshot management through a dedicated API.
- **Access to advanced storage classes**: You can create new Scaleway Block Storage 5K or 15K volumes for workloads needing higher performance and lower latency.
- **Ongoing support**: Enhanced support and updates tailored for Block Storage API-managed resources.

## Impact on volume names in virtual machines

When transitioning to the Block Storage API, you may notice changes in how volumes are identified in your virtual machines (VMs). For more details on how devices are named and identified, refer to [our documentation on identifying devices on a Scaleway Instance](/compute/instances/reference-content/identify-devices/).

## How to transition?

- For a step-by-step guide to transitioning your block volumes and snapshots from the Instance API to the Block Storage API, refer to [our migration documentation](/compute/instances/how-to/migrate-volumes-snapshots-to-sbs/).

- To identify which API manages your volumes and snapshots, refer to the [dedicated documentation](/storage/block/api-cli/identifying-volume-snapshot-api/).

- To find out how to convert a Block Storage legacy volume into a Block Storage Low Latency volume, read [the dedicated documentation](/faq/blockstorage/#how-can-i-convert-a-block-storage-legacy-volume-into-a-block-storage-low-latency-volume).
