<Requirements />

- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## Problem

When interacting with Scaleway resources using the Scaleway console, API, CLI, or any other developer tools, you encounter one of the following issues:

- a message saying **Insufficient permissions** displays
- a message saying **Access Denied** displays
- a `403` error displays
- no output displays when interacting with Scaleway products using a command-line tool, and no changes appear in the Scaleway console

## Cause

You (or the IAM [user](/iam/concepts/#user) or [application](/iam/concepts/#application)) may not have the correct appropriate [IAM permissions](/iam/how-to/view-permission-sets/) to perform the desired actions.

## Solution

1. Make sure that you are using a valid [API key](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elementsiam/api-keys).

2. Make sure that the bearer of the API key (IAM [user](/iam/concepts/#user) or [application](/iam/concepts/#application)) has the appropriate [IAM permissions](/iam/how-to/view-permission-sets/) to perform the desired actions.

3. If you **do not** have [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status for the Organization in which you are trying to perform actions, contact the IAM manager or owner of this Organization.

4. If you are using a command-line tool to interact with Scaleway resources, make sure that there is no environment variable overriding your API key. Refer to the [documentation on environment variables priority](/scaleway-cli/reference-content/environment-variables/#environment-variables-priority) for more information.
