With Block Storage it is possible to expand the volume size of an Instance.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />
 
<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com/) 
  - You have [created](/storage/block/how-to/create-a-volume/) a Block Storage volume
</Message>

## How to increase the volume size from the Scaleway console

1. Click the **Volumes** tab on the Instance information page of the console. A list of your volumes displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> beside the volume you want to increase and then click **Increase Volume**.
3. Increase the size according to your preference with the <Icon name="plus" /> button.

4. Click **Increase your Volume** to confirm.
    <Message type="note">
      Currently, only the **increase** of a Block Storage volume is supported. The maximum size of a Block volume is 10 TB.

## How to increase the partition size of the volume

<Message type="tip">
  It is recommeneded to make a backup of your data using the [snapshot](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/instances/how-to/create-a-snapshot/) feature, before increasing the partition size of your volume. This helps to avoid any data loss. 
</Message>


1. Connect to your Instance using [SSH](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).
2. Use the `lsblk` command to identify your Block Storage volume's mount point. In the following example the volume is mounted at `/mnt/block-volume`: 
    ```
    root@scw-friendly-beaver:~# lsblk
    NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    loop0     7:0    0 61.9M  1 loop /snap/core20/1270
    loop1     7:1    0 67.2M  1 loop /snap/lxd/21835
    loop2     7:2    0 43.3M  1 loop /snap/snapd/14295
    sda       8:0    0  9.3G  0 disk
    ├─sda1    8:1    0  9.2G  0 part /
    ├─sda14   8:14   0    4M  0 part
    └─sda15   8:15   0  106M  0 part /boot/efi
    sdb       8:16   0 37.3G  0 disk
    └─sdb1    8:17   0 23.3G  0 part /mnt/block-volume
    ```
3. [Unmount](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/storage/block/how-to/unmount-a-volume/) the volume:
    ```
    umount /mnt/block-volume
    ```
4. Check that the volume is unmounted by running the `lsblk` command. 
5. Use `growpart` to increase the partition size of your block storage volume (here `/dev/sdb1`):
    ```
    growpart /dev/sdX 1
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      Take a note of the space between the device identifier and the partition number. 
    </Message>
6. Increase the partition size of the volume using `resize2fs`. Replace `/dev/sdX` with the name of your block volume in the following command:
    ```
    resize2fs -p /dev/sdX1
    ```
7. Run `e2fsck` on the Block Storage volume to check that everything went well. Replace `/dev/sdX` with the name of your block volume in the following command:
    ```
    e2fsck /dev/sdX1
    ```

    An output like the following example displays. The status of your file system should be `clean`

    ```
    root@scw-elegant-franklin:~# e2fsck /dev/sda
    e2fsck 1.45.5 (07-Jan-2020)
    /dev/sda: clean, 11/1827840 files, 158770/7324218 blocks
    ```
8. [Remount](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/storage/block/how-to/mount-and-use-volume/) the volume to access the files stored on it: 
    ```
    mount -o defaults /dev/sda /mnt/block-volume
    ```
