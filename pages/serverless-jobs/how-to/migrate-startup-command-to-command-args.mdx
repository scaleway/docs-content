The  Serverless Jobs `v1alpha2` API introduces a new startup execution mechanism based on [commands and arguments](/serverless-containers/concepts/#commands-and-arguments), replacing the legacy startup command.

The Scaleway console allows you to quickly and easily migrate your existing jobs to the new system.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An existing job that uses a startup command

1. Click **Jobs** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The jobs page displays.

2. Click the name of the job you want to manage, then click the **Settings** tab.

3. Scroll down to the **Configure advanced options**, then click the **Execution** tab.

4. Click the **Upgrade** button. A pop-up displays.

5. Split your existing startup command into a command (which corresponds to the `ENTRYPOINT` Docker instruction), and arguments (which correspond to the `CMD` Docker instruction).

6. Click **Upgrade to the new format** to finish.

Your Serverless Job now uses the command and arguments mechanism.
