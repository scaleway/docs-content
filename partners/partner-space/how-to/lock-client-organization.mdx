If you are confronted with a client who does not respect Scaleway’s Terms of Service, you can lock their Organization. 

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- Scaleway Partner status
- [Added a client](/partners/partner-space/how-to/add-client/)

  <Message type="important">
     Locking an Organization prevents its owner from ordering or managing resources.
    </Message>

1. Click <Icon name="more" /> to the right of the client’s creation date. 
2. Click **Lock Organization**. A pop-up displays.
3. Type **LOCK** in the text area.
4. Click **Lock** to confirm.
