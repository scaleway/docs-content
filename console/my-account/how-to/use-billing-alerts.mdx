The Scaleway console **Billing Alerts** feature allows you to manage and keep track of your expenses by setting up alerts to trigger when a budget threshold is reached. An alert can be sent to you by SMS, email or API webhook.

The budget is the limit of your expenses, in euros. The threshold is a percentage of this limit. Both are previously defined by you in the console.

**For example:**

  - If you have defined a budget of €1000, you may configure an email notification to be sent once you have consumed 50% of this limit. In this case, once your consumption gets to €500 you will receive an email informing you the limit threshold has been reached.

      Billing alerts only provide a rough estimate of what can be charged to your monthly invoice.

## Webhook API Call

When you configure a Webhook, an `HTTP` request is made to the configured URL. It will transmit the following information as an `HTTP POST` request to the given URL:

```
Header: "Content-Type": "application/json"
POST /my/configured/webhook
{
    "invoice_start_date": <INVOICE_START_DATE>,
    "threshold": <THRESHOLD_VALUE_IN_PERCENT>
}
```
