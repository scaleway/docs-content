When creating a VPN [connection](/site-to-site-vpn/reference-content/understanding-s2svpn/#connection), you must define a security proposal (aka IPSec proposal). The security proposal defines the encryption and authentication methods used to secure the IPSec VPN tunnel.

There are two parts to a security proposal:

- **IKEv2** (Internet Key Exchange): Establishes a secure connection between the VPN gateway and the customer gateway
- **ESP** (Encapsulating Security Payload): Encrypts and authenticates the payload of the IP data packets traveling through the tunnel.

When defining your Site-to-Site VPN security proposal, you need to define the options to be used for the following elements:

| Protocol        | Element         | Description                                        | Options  |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **IKEv2**       | **Encryption**  | Algorithm to encrypt IKE negotiation messages | `aes` (AEAD and non-AEAD) |
| **IKEv2**       | **Integrity**   | HMAC-based algorithm to verify IKE negotiation messages have not been tampered with | `sha`   |
| **IKEv2**       | **Key Exchange Method** | DH group to define strength of key exchange | `ecp`, `curve`, `modp` |
| **ESP**       | **Encryption**  | Algorithm to encrypt traffic's data payloads  | `aes` (AEAD and non-AEAD)  |
| **ESP**         | **Integrity**   | Only set an HMAC-based algorithm to verify integrity of data payloads if **not** using an AEAD algorithm for ESP encryption. Otherwise, integrity is built-in, and this option does not need to be set. | `sha`   |
