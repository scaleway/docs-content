An Elastic Metal server can be shut down from the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com). This powers off the physical server.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)  
  - You have [configured your SSH key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key)

</Message>

1. Click **Elastic Metal** in the **Bare Metal** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Elastic Metal dashboard displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the server you want to shut down. A drop-down menu displays.
3. Click **Power off** in the menu.
4. Confirm that you have shut down the operating system and click **Power off Elastic Metal** to power off the server.
    <Message type="important">
      Make sure to stop your operating system by executing the `halt` command,
      before shutting off the server. Otherwise, you risk damaging the file system
      and causing data loss.
