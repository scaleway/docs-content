 The Cross-AZ Read Replica feature ensures your data is replicated in a dedicated read-only node, which is located in another AZ within the same Region as your main node.
  
 For more information, refer to the [How to create Read Replicas](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/create-read-replica/) documentation page.
