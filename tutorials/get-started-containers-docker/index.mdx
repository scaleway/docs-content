This is the first in a series of tutorials accompanying our [video demonstrations on getting started with Kubernetes](TODO-LINK). In this first tutorial, we focus on one of the fundamental concepts behind Kubernetes: the [container](/compute/containers/concepts/#container). We use the popular containerization platform [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to create and deploy a simple containerized "Hello World" application, before moving on to look at a slightly more complex application example. We finish by pushing the container images we have created to the Scaleway [Container Registry](/compute/container-registry/concepts/#container-registry). Future videos and tutorials in this series will show you how to then deploy your containerized application with Kubernetes, specifically with the Scaleway [Kubernetes Kapsule](/compute/kubernetes/concepts/#kubernetes-kapsule).

## Key concepts: containers, Docker and Kubernetes

Before starting the practical steps of this tutorial, we review a few key concepts that must be understood first:

* **Container**: A portable package of software that includes its own environment and dependencies (code, runtime, configuration, system libraries) so that it can run on any host system.

* **Docker**: An open source platform to package applications into containers. As well as building containerized application images, Docker also lets you run them and much more. Alternatives to Docker include [Podman](https://podman.io/) and [LXC](https://linuxcontainers.org/), though Docker is the market leader and the one we'll be using in this tutorial.

* **Kubernetes**: An [open source container orchestration platform](https://kubernetes.io/), designed to automate the deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications.

While these concepts can seem quite abstract and overwhelming, in reality if you do everything in order it is not difficult or scary. The general order of events is:

1. Build your application
2. Containerize it with Docker
3. Use Kubernetes to orchestrate the deployment of your containerized app at the appropriate scale.

There are many advantages to building and deploying applications in this way. Here are just a few advantages of this type of deployment, with containers and Kubernetes:
- **Portability**: Containerized applications can be run on any cloud, platform or machine.
- **Efficiency**: Containerization uses fewer resources than Virtual Machines.
- **Agility**: With containerization, development and delivery is faster, more agile and more flexible.
- **Scalability**: Kubernetes is ideal for quickly scaling your application deploymet up or down adding and removing containers depending on the need.
- **Reliability**: Kubernetes keeps containerized workloads up and running at all times
And encompassing all of the above...
- **Cloud Native**: Building apps for Kubernetes mean embracing Cloud-native design: the building and running of scalable applications in modern, dynamic Cloud environments.

## Installing Docker

The following steps show how to install Docker on an Ubuntu Linux operating system, from the command line. For instructions on installations for MacOS or Windows, see the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

1. Remove any previous versions of Docker that might be installed:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io
    ```

2. Update the apt package cache:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

3. Install some required packages for Docker. Docker uses HTTPS for its repository, so we make sure we have everything needed to download Docker with a secure connection:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
    ```

4. Add Docker's [GPG key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard), used to authenticate the Docker content and updates we download to our machine:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
    ```

5. Add the reference to Docker's remote repository. This tells our local machine the remote storage location from which it should get and install Docker and any future updates:

    ```bash
    sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
    ```

6. Update the apt package cache again:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

7. Install the Docker engine itself:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install docker-ce
    ```

8. Check Docker is installed:

    ```
    docker -v
    ```

    If Docker is successfuly installed, you should see an output confirming your version number, for example:

    ```
    Docker version 20.10.12, build e91ed57
    ```

## Creating and deploying containerized applications with Docker

We show two examples of making containerized applications with Docker and take you through the following process for each:

1. Creating the **Dockerfile**
2. Building an **image** from the Dockerfile
3. Using the image to run the **containerized application**

### Example 1 - a simple Hello World app

We start by creating an extremely simple, one-line Python application that prints "Hello World" to the command line, then show how to use Docker to containerize this application.

#### Making the application

1. Create a folder called `myfirstapp` and navigate into it:

    ```bash
    mkdir myfirstapp && cd myfirstapp
    ```

2. Create a python file called `myapp.py`:

    ```bash
    nano myapp.py
    ```

### Example 2 - a more complex app
