2. Click **Connect to Dedibox** to start linking your Dedibox account.
3. Enter your Dedibox login information and click **Sign in**.
4. We run a check to locate your existing Scaleway account.

     - You have noted your login for the Scaleway console.
     - Your Scaleway Dedibox and Scaleway Cloud account information will be updated with the information provided on this page.
     - You understand that linked accounts cannot be unlinked.
     - Payment information will be updated and unified based on these rules:
       - If SEPA is your preferred payment method in either account, it becomes the default choice for both Scaleway Cloud and Dedibox invoices.
       - If SEPA is not used, the preferred payment method of credit card remains the same for both accounts.
       - If different credit cards are used for Dedibox and Scaleway Cloud, the card registered with Scaleway Cloud becomes the default for both accounts.
            <Message type="tip">
              After linking accounts, you can modify your payment method in the [billing section](https://console.scaleway.com/billing/payment) of the Scaleway console. All default payment methods will be transferred to your linked account.
