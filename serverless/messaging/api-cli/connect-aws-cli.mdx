The AWS-CLI is an open-source tool built on top of the AWS SDK for Python (Boto) that provides commands for interacting with AWS services. With minimal configuration, you can start using the AWS-CLI with your Scaleway Messaging and Queuing SQS/SNS namespace. This allows you to create, list and manage your queues and topics, send messages and much more, all from your command line.

This guide shows you how to install the AWS-CLI and configure it for connection to your Scaleway Messaging and Queuing SQS/SNS namespace.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)

## How to install the AWS-CLI

To interact with Scaleway Messaging and Queuing, both `aws-cli` and `awscli-plugin-endpoint` need to be installed. The `awscli-plugin-endpoint` is a useful plugin to help people more easily access third-party providers such as Scaleway.

Install both `aws-cli` and `awscli-plugin` using `pip`.

```
pip3 install awscli
pip3 install awscli-plugin-endpoint
```

## How to configure the AWS-CLI

Now you have installed the AWS-CLI, you need to configure it for use with your Scaleway Messaging and Queuing SQS/SNS namespace.

1. Create a file named `~/.aws/config` by running the following command:
    ```
    aws configure set plugins.endpoint awscli_plugin_endpoint
    ```
2. Open the `~/.aws/config` file you just created in a text editor and edit it as follows (the SNS or SQS URL for your namespace can be found in the console on the list of your [Messaging and Queuing namespaces](https://console.scaleway.com/messaging/namespaces)
    ```
    [plugins]
    endpoint = awscli_plugin_endpoint
    [default]
    sns =
      endpoint_url = https://sqs-sns.mnq.fr-par.scw.cloud
    sqs =
      endpoint_url = https://sqs-sns.mnq.fr-par.scw.cloud 
    ```

    Optionally, you can also configure additional profiles by adding new blocks under `[default]`. For example, you can add a second profile, `[profile aws]`, to connect to the AWS SQS/SNS service if you want:

    ```
    [plugins]
    endpoint = awscli_plugin_endpoint
    [default]
    sns =
      endpoint_url = https://sqs-sns.mnq.fr-par.scw.cloud
    sqs =
      endpoint_url = https://sqs-sns.mnq.fr-par.scw.cloud
    [profile aws]
    region=eu-west-3
    output=json
    ```

    <Message type="important">
      If you are using the AWS-CLI v2, you must include the path to the plugin in your configuration file. Add `cli_legacy_plugin_path = <path-to-plugin>` to the `[plugins]` section, replacing `<path-to-plugin>` with the corresponding path.

3. Generate a credentials file using the following command:
    ```
    aws configure
    ```
4. Open the `~/.aws/credentials` file you just created, and add the access key and secret key you saved when you generated your [SQS/SNS namespace's credentials](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-credentials/) as follows:
    ```
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id=<ACCESS_KEY>
    aws_secret_access_key=<SECRET_KEY>
    ```

    If you have other profiles, you can add a block to indicate their credentials too:
    ```
    [aws]
    aws_access_key_id=<ACCESS_KEY>
    aws_secret_access_key=<SECRET_KEY>
    ```
6. Test that everything is set up correctly with the following command:
    ```
    aws sqs list-queues
    ```

    Use the `--profile` option if you want to test it using a different profile.
