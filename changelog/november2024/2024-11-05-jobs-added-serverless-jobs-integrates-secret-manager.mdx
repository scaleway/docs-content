Serverless Jobs is now integrated with Secret Manager natively.

This allows seamless retrieval of sensitive data like API keys, database credentials and reducing complexity while enhancing security by keeping secrets out of your codebase. [Link to documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/serverless/jobs/how-to/reference-secret-in-job/)
