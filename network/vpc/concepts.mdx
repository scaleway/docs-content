## Availability Zone

An Availability Zone refers to the geographical location in which your [private network](/network/vpc/concepts#private-networks) or [public gateway](/network/vpc/concepts#public-gateway) will be created. To connect Instances to private networks, or private networks to public gateways, they must be within the same Availability Zone. Find below the list of availability zones by region:

- France - Paris (`fr-par`)
  `fr-par-1`
  `fr-par-2`
- The Netherlands - Amsterdam (`nl-ams`)
  `nl-ams-1`
- Poland - Warsaw (`pl-waw`)
  `pl-waw-1`

## DHCP

**D**ynamic **H**ost **C**onfiguration **P**rotocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol for dynamically assigning IP addresses and other configuration parameters to Instances in a private network. DHCP is a feature of a [public gateway](#public-gateway), which can take a pool of available IP addresses (range) and dynamically share them between Instances in the attached private networks. This eliminates the need for users to manually assign private IP addresses to their devices as they join or leave the network. Static associations can also be configured to assign specific IP addresses to specific Instances, according to their MAC addresses.

## DNS

The **D**omain **N**ame **S**ystem (DNS) is a naming system for devices connected to the Internet or private networks. Most prominently, DNS servers translate text-based domain names (eg www.scaleway.com) to numerical [IP addresses](#ip-address) eg (51.158.66.220). In terms of VPC, the [public gateway](#public-gateway) acts as a local DNS server for the Instances of a private network, resolving the Instances IP addresses into their hostname.

## Flexible IP

Flexible IP addresses are [public IP addresses](#public-ip-address) associated with your account, which you can hold independently of any Instance or public gateway. When you create an Instance or a public gateway, it receives a flexible (public) IP address by default, which is added to your account's pool of flexible IPs. You can detach, reattach and migrate your flexible IPs between your Instances and public gateways at your convenience. Note however that each Public Gateway must have a public IP attached to it. If you detach one flexible IP you must attach another. When you delete a flexible IP address, it is disassociated from your account to be used by other users.

</Concept>

## IP Address

An **I**nternet **P**rotocol address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. Written in human-readable notations, an IP address is generally shown as 4 octets of numbers, eg 72.16.254.1. IP addresses can be [public](#public-ip-address) or [private](#private-ip-address).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## NAT 
**N**etwork **A**ddress **T**ranslation maps private IP addresses in a private network to the public IP address of the Public Gateway. Private IP addresses are not routable on the public Internet, so NAT makes it possible for them to securely communicate with the internet via the gateway. There are two types of NAT:

- **Dynamic NAT** enables egress traffic from a private network to the public Internet by dynamically, automatically mapping the outgoing traffic IP addresses and ports with the public IP address and ports of the public gateway.

- **Static NAT** enables ingress traffic from the public Internet towards Instances on a private network by mapping pre-defined ports of the public IP address of the gateway to specific ports and IP addresses on the private network.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Private IP Address

Private [IP addresses](#ip-address) identify devices on local/private networks. They are not routed on the Internet - if you enter the private IP address of an Instance into a random browser connected to the Internet, it will not connect to anything. This is because a private IP address is only relevant within a particular local network. Instances within a local network can communicate securely between themselves via their private IP addresses.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Private Networks

Scaleway's Private Networks feature creates a LAN-like layer 2 ethernet network between your Instances. When you connect an Instance to a private network, a new network interface is configured on the Instance, with a unique media access control address (MAC address). Private Networks thus allow your Instances to communicate in an isolated and secure network without the need of being connected to the public Internet. Each Instance can be connected to one or several Private Networks. You can also opt to attach a [Public Gateway](#public-gateway) to your private networks, for extra functionality.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Public Gateway

Public Gateways sit at the border of private networks and provide extra functionality. They provide services to automate the allocation of private IP addresses ([DHCP](#dhcp)), and deal with traffic entering and exiting the network ([NAT](#nat)). You can add a Public Gateway to each of your private networks.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Public IP Address

Public [IP addresses](#ip-address) identify devices on the Internet. You can enter the public IP address of an Instance into any browser connected to the Internet, and access content being served from that Instance. You can think of public IP addresses like postal addresses for buildings - they are unique, and tell the routers directing traffic through the Internet where to find a particular server.

## Tags 
Tags let you organize your private networks and public gateways. You can assign as many tags as you want to each network and/or gateway, and use this feature to identify, sort and filter your VPC products.

## VPC

**V**irtual **P**rivate **C**loud (VPC) provides network functionalities for your Scaleway cloud. VPC products include [Private Networks](#private-networks) and [Public Gateway](#public-gateway).
