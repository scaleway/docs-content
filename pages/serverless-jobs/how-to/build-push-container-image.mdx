This page explains how to create a simple Dockerfile to containerize your applications for deployment using Scaleway Serverless Jobs.

## How to Write a Dockerfile

1. Create a file named `Dockerfile` in your project directory.

2. Add the following content to your Dockerfile, adjusting the base image and commands according to your application:

```dockerfile
# Use an official base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

## How to build and push your image from your dockerfile

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile.

2. Run the following command to build your Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t my-application .
```

3. Log in to your Scaleway account in the terminal:

```
docker login -u <your-email> --password-stdin 
```

4. Tag your Docker image so it matches your Scaleway registry's format:

```
docker tag my-application 
```

5. Push the Docker image to the Scaleway Container Registry:

```
docker push
```

You can now access your container image from the [Scaleway Container Registry](https://console.scaleway.com/)
