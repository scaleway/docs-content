## Apple silicon

Apple silicon is Apple's own design of processor. It is the basis of Mac computers, as well as many other Apple products.

## Apple silicon as-a-service

Scaleway Apple silicon as-a-Service uses [Apple Mac mini](#mac-mini) hardware. These devices rely on the power of Apple's [silicon](#apple-silicon) technology, ensuring exceptional performance and energy efficiency.

Apple silicon as-a-Service is tailored for developing, building, testing, and signing applications for Apple devices such as iPhones, iPads, Mac computers, and more. The Mac mini boasts a sophisticated neural engine that significantly enhances machine learning capabilities.

## Commitment plan

The commitment plan for Apple silicon is a flexible pricing option that allows customers to choose between fully flexible pay-as-you-go pricing or a long-term monthly commitment period for their Apple silicon servers

By committing to a plan, you can enjoy better rates than pay-as-you-go pricing. The initial commitment is for one month from the server order. At the end of your initial commitment period, the commitment is automatically renewed every month on the anniversary date unless you choose to delete the machine, in which case the deletion will take effect on the anniversary date of the commitment.

It is important to note that the commitment applies only to the server. Options, such as the VPC option, remain without commitment but benefit from lower prices when used with a committed server. [Learn how to manage a commitment plan.](/apple-silicon/how-to/manage-commitment-plan/)

## Mac mini

The Mac mini is a physical hardware designed by Apple, powered by the [Apple silicon](#apple-silicon) chip. It is the basis for Scaleway's [Apple silicon as-a-service](#apple-silicon-as-a-service) offer.

## Private Networks

Private Networks allow your Mac mini to communicate in an isolated and secure network with other Scaleway resources. This is an optional-billed feature for Mac mini. Find out [how to attach your Mac mini to a Private Network](/apple-silicon/how-to/use-private-networks/).

## VNC

Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a remote desktop-sharing protocol. It allows you to visualize the graphical screen output of a remote computer and transfer local keyboard and mouse events to the remote computer using a network connection. The protocol is platform-independent, which means that various clients exist for Linux, Windows, and macOS-based computers. The VNC server used on the Mac mini is directly integrated with the macOS system without any restrictions from our side. Check out our documentation on [how to connect to your Mac mini via VNC](/apple-silicon/how-to/access-remote-desktop-mac-mini/#accessing-the-remote-desktop).
