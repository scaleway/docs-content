Scaleway Generative APIs are designed as drop-in replacement for the OpenAI APIs.
The Models API allows you to easily list the various AI models available at Scaleway.

## List models

Lists the available models, and provides basic information about each one.

```
curl -s \
     --url "https://api.scaleway.ai/v1/models" \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer ${SCW_SECRET_KEY}"
```
