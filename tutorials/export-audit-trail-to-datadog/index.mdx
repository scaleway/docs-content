This tutorial shows you how to export your Audit Trail events to [DataDog](https://www.datadoghq.com/). For the purpose of this tutorail, we are building a [custom OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/custom-collector/) to collect Audit Trail events through the [Audit Trail receiver](https://github.com/scaleway/opentelemetry-collector-scaleway/tree/main/receiver/scwaudittrail) and export them with the [DataDog exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/datadogexporter).

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created an [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- Created a Scaleway [Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/)
- Installed the [OpenTelemetry collector builder](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/custom-collector/#step-1---install-the-builder)
- Created a [Datadog account](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/login) and a [Datadog API key](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/#api-keys)

## Building the OpenTelemetry collector

1. Open a terminal and check that the `ocb` binary is ready to be used. The output of the `help` command should display, meaning the `ocb` binary is ready to be used.

    ```
    ./ocb help
    ```

2. Create a manifest file named `builder-config.yaml` and paste the following content into it. This file is used to defines code generation, the compile process, and the components to include in your Collector’s distribution.

    ```yaml
    dist:
      name: otelcol-audit-trail
      description: OpenTelemetry Collector for Audit Trail
      output_path: ./otelcol-audit-trail

    exporters:
      - gomod:
          github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/exporter/datadogexporter v0.118.0

    processors:
      - gomod:
          go.opentelemetry.io/collector/processor/batchprocessor v0.118.0

    receivers:
      - gomod:
          github.com/scaleway/opentelemetry-collector-scaleway/receiver/scwaudittrail v0.1.0

    providers:
      - gomod: go.opentelemetry.io/collector/confmap/provider/envprovider v1.24.0
      - gomod: go.opentelemetry.io/collector/confmap/provider/fileprovider v1.24.0
      - gomod: go.opentelemetry.io/collector/confmap/provider/httpprovider v1.24.0
      - gomod: go.opentelemetry.io/collector/confmap/provider/httpsprovider v1.24.0
      - gomod: go.opentelemetry.io/collector/confmap/provider/yamlprovider v1.24.0
    ```

3. Run the following command to build the Collector. `GOOS` and `GOARCH` are needed in the command as the target deployment is Linux with an AMD64 CPU.

    ```
    GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 ./ocb --config builder-config.yaml
    ```

You now have a new folder named `otelcol-audit-trail/` with the binary `otelcol-audit-trail` compiled inside.

## Deploying the Collector

1. Run the following command to upload the Collector binary to your Instance. Make sure that you replace `<INSTANCE_IP_ADDRESS>` with the IP address of your Instance.

    ```
    scp otelcol-audit-trail/otelcol-audit-trail root@<INSTANCE_IP_ADDRESS>:/usr/local/bin/
    ```

2. Connect to your Instance via SSH:

    ```
    ssh root@<INSTANCE_IP_ADDRESS>
    ```

## Configuring the Collector

Create a file named `/etc/opentelemetry-collector/config.yaml` and paste the following content into it. This file is the configuration our custom Collector will run.

    ```yaml
    receivers:
      scwaudittrail:
        access_key: <SCW_ACCESS_KEY>
        secret_key: <SCW_SECRET_KEY>
        organization_id: <SCW_DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ID>
        region: <SCW_DEFAULT_REGION>

    processors:
      batch:
        send_batch_max_size: 1000
        send_batch_size: 100
        timeout: 10s

    exporters:
      datadog:
        idle_conn_timeout: 10s
        api:
          key: <DD_API_KEY>
          site: <DD_SITE>

    service:
      pipelines:
        logs:
          receivers: [scwaudittrail]
          processors: [batch]
          exporters: [datadog]
    ```

Make sure that you replace:

- `<SCW_ACCESS_KEY>` with your Scaleway API access key
- `<SCW_SECRET_KEY>` with your Scaleway API secret key
- `<SCW_DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ID>` with your Scaleway Organization ID
- `<SCW_DEFAULT_REGION>` with the Scaleway region to target
- `<DD_API_KEY>` with your DataDog API secret key
- `<DD_SITE>` with the [DataDog site](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/site/#access-the-datadog-site) you are on

## Running the Collector

1. Create a file named `/etc/systemd/system/opentelemetry-collector.service` and paste the following content into it. This file will create the `systemd` service that runs the Collector.

    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=OpenTelemetry Collector
    After=multi-user.target

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/otelcol-audit-trail --config /etc/opentelemetry-collector/config.yaml
    Type=simple

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

2. Run the following command to update `systemd` services:

    ```
    systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

3. Run the following commands to enable and start the service:

    ```
    systemctl enable opentelemetry-collector.service
    systemctl start opentelemetry-collector.service
    ```

4. Make sure that the service is running:

    ```
    systemctl status opentelemetry-collector.service
    ```

5. Run the command below to visualize your logs:

    ```
    journalctl -fu opentelemetry-collector.service
    ```

    An output similar to the following should display to confirm that the Collector is polling Audit Trail events:

      ```

      ```
6. Optionally, log in to your Datadog account and click **Logs** in the left hand side menu. Your logs should display.
