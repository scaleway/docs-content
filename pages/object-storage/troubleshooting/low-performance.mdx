import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'


<Requirements />

- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## Problem

I am noticing decreased throughputs, timeouts, high latency, and overall instability on my Scaleway Object Storage deployment.

## Solution

- Go to the [Status page](https://status.scaleway.com/) to see if there is an ongoing incident on the Scaleway infrastructure.

- Retrieve the logs of your buckets using any Amazon S3-compatible tool to identify the cause of the problem:
    - [Rclone](https://rclone.org/docs/#logging)
    - [S3cmd](https://s3tools.org/usage)
    - [MinIO Client](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc-admin/mc-admin-logs.html#mc-admin-logs)
    - [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/logs/get-log-events.html)

## Going further

- Refer to the documentation on [how to optimize your Object Storage performance](/object-storage/reference-content/optimize-object-storage-performance/) for more information.

- If you did not manage to identify the error and solve it by yourself, [open a support ticket](/account/how-to/open-a-support-ticket/), and provide as many details as possible, along with the necessary information below:
    - Object Storage Endpoint (e.g. `s3.fr-par.scw.cloud`)
    - Bucket name
    - Object name (if the request concerns an object)
    - Request type (PUT, GET, etc.)
    - HTTP status code
    - Date and time (timestamp)
    - User-agent (SDK, client, console, etc.)
    - Transaction ID (if possible)
    - Log / Trace of the error (if possible)
