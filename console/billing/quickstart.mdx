Before you can order Scaleway resources, you must add your payment method to your account.
<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to add a payment method

1. Click **Billing** in the Organization drop-down menu to go to the [Billing page](https://console.scaleway.com/billing/overview).
2. Click **Payment and billing**.
3. Scroll down to **Payment Methods**.

You can choose between two payment methods: **credit card** or **SEPA mandate**.

### How to add a credit card

1. Enter the details of your credit or debit card.
2. Click **Add credit card** to confirm. A [3D Secure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-D_Secure) validation is initiated. Depending on your bank, you may be asked to enter a code received by SMS or via an application on your smartphone.
3. Enter the code and validate the form.
    <Message type="note">
     When you register a new credit card, an authorization charge of **â‚¬1** is debited from your account. This authorization charge is a **dummy transaction made to check the validity of the card, and will carry a 4-digit validation code**, displayed on **your bank account statement**. The authorization charge will be reimbursed within 48 to 72 hours.

4. Click **Verify**. A pop-up appears.
5. Enter the 4-digit validation code displayed on your bank account statement.

      Bank account statements have different displays depending on the bank, but the validation code can always be found in the description of your transactions. The image below provides an example of how the validation code might appear in your bank statement:
