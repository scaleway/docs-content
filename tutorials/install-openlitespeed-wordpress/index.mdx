[OpenLiteSpeed](https://openlitespeed.org/) combines speed, security, scalability, optimization and simplicity in one friendly open-source package. The source code of the project is released under the GPLv3 license and available publicly on [GitHub](https://github.com/litespeedtech/openlitespeed).

The application provides a web-based administration interface, compatibility with Apache rewrite rules, as well as customized [PHP](https://php.net) processing for improved performance.

## Installing OpenLiteSpeed

1. Start with downloading and installing the OpenLiteSpeed GPG key:
    ```
    wget -O /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/lst_debian_repo.gpg http://rpms.litespeedtech.com/debian/lst_debian_repo.gpg
    wget -O /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/lst_repo.gpg http://rpms.litespeedtech.com/debian/lst_repo.gpg
    ```
2. Add the OpenLiteSpeed repository to the [APT](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(Package_Manager)>) package manager.
    ```
    echo "deb http://rpms.litespeedtech.com/debian/ bionic main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/openlitespeed.list
    ```
3. Update the inventory of the `apt` package manager.
    ```
    apt update
    ```
4. Install OpenLiteSpeed and PHP 7.3 via `apt`.
    ```
    apt install openlitespeed lsphp73 lsphp73-mysql -y
    ```
5. Configure PHP 7.3 with OpenLiteSpeed by creating a symlink to the PHP binary.
    ```
    ln -sf /usr/local/lsws/lsphp73/bin/lsphp /usr/local/lsws/fcgi-bin/lsphp5
    ```

### Setting up MariaDB

1. Start by installing the [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) database server via `apt`.
    ```
    apt install mariadb-server -y
    ```
2. Run the [setup utility](/tutorials/mariadb-ubuntu-bionic#securing-mariadb) to configure the MariaDB server and to set a password for the root user of it.
    ```
    mysql_secure_installation
    ```
3. Connect to MariaDB as `root` user with the password configured in the previous step.
    ```
    mysql -u root -p
    ```

    The MariaDB shell displays.

    ```
    Welcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
    Your MariaDB connection id is 49
    Server version: 10.1.40-MariaDB-0ubuntu0.18.04.1 Ubuntu 18.04

    Copyright (c) 2000, 2018, Oracle, MariaDB Corporation Ab and others.

    Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

    MariaDB [(none)]>
    ```
4. Create a SQL database for Wordpress and grant the required permissions to it.
    ```
    CREATE DATABASE wordpress;
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO wordpress@localhost IDENTIFIED BY '<a_secure_password>';
    ```
5. Leave the MariaDB shell.
    ```
    exit;
    ```

### Testing the OpenLiteSpeed Installation

1. Start OpenLiteSpeed by running the following command:
    ```
    /usr/local/lsws/bin/lswsctrl start
    ```
2. A test site is running at `http://instance_ip:8088`. Open the test site in your browser. You can run differnt demo applications like a [CGI-script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface), a check of the installed PHP version, password authentication, file upload and so on.

### Accessing the OpenLiteSpeed Administration Interface

Open the administration interface in your web browser at `https://instance_ip:7080`.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-ols_login.webp" alt="" />

Login using the following credentials:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `123456`

<Message type="important">
  For security reasons, it is recommended to change the admin password by running the following script: `/usr/local/lsws/admin/misc/admpass.sh`;
</Message> 

The administration interface displays.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-ols_dashboard.webp" alt="" />

The status of OpenLiteSpeed is visible in the interface and you can configure additional settings.

### Creating a Virtual Host in OpenLiteSpeed

1. Enter the OpenLiteSpeed directory.
    ```
    cd /usr/local/lsws
    ```
2. Create a directory structure for the new virtual host. You can name it as you want. In this example it is called `wordpress.example.com`:
    ```
    mkdir wordpress.example.com
    mkdir wordpress.example.com/html
    ```
3. Open the OpenLiteSpeed configuration assistant in a web browser and click **Virtual Hosts** to enter the virtual host configuration. The virtual host list displays.
4. Click **+** to create a new virtual host.
5. Enter the details of the virtual host and click the disk icon:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-ols_vh.webp" alt="" />

    - **Virtual Host Name**: An unique identifier for the virtual host, i.e. `Wordpress`
    - **Virtual Host Root**: The root directory of the virtual host, i.e. `$SERVER_ROOT/wordpress.example.com`
    - **Config File**: The path to the configuration file of the virtual host, i.e. `$SERVER_ROOT/conf/vhosts/wordpress.example.com/vhconf.conf`
6. Click **Click to create** to let OpenLiteSpeed automatically generate a configuration file.  As the configuration file is not yet created, OpenLiteSpeed proposes to create a new one. Click the disk icon to save. 
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-ols_vh_conf.webp" alt="" />
7. Go back to the virtual host configuration and click the **General**-tab to configure the **Document Root** for the virtual host. Click the disk icon to save the configuration once set:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-ols_vh_docroot.webp" alt="" />
8. Click the **Rewrite** tab in the virtual host configuration. Then activate the **Enable Rewrite** and **Auto Load from .htaccess** options and save the configuration:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-ols_vh_rewrite.webp" alt="" />

### Creating a Listener in OpenLiteSpeed

A listener defines the port on which the application launches. To make WordPress available on the standard HTTP port (_Port 80_), a new listener has to be configured in OpenLiteSpeed.

1. Enter the **Listeners** section of the administration panel, then click **+** to configure a new listener:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-ols_listener.webp" alt="" />
2. Enter the details of the new listener:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-ols_listener_web.webp" alt="" />

    - **Name**: A name for the listener, i.e. `Web`
    - **IP Address**: Define an IP address to listen on, or select `ANY` to listen on all IP addresses configured on the instance.
    - **Port**: Set the port to listen on, i.e. `80` to listen on the standard HTTP port
    - **Binding**: Choose the OpenLiteSpeed child processes to bind the listener on. Leave the default value to bind the lister to all processes.
    - **Secure**: Select if a secured connection shall be used. A TLS/SSL certificate is required for a secure connection. Set the value to `No` to use plain HTTP.
    - **Notes**: This field can be used to add notes to a listener.

  Once all values are set, save the configuration by clicking on the disk icon.
3. Map the listener to a virtual host and set the domain name by clicking on **+** in the **Virtual Host Mappings** section:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-ols_listener_add_vh.webp" alt="" />
4. Choose the Virtual Host from the drop-down list (i.e. `Wordpress`) and enter the domain name to use for the virtual host. Once set, click the disk icon to save the configuration:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-ols_listener_vhmapping.webp" alt="" />
5. Launch a graceful restart of OpenLiteSpeed by clicking on the logo, then on the corresponding button:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-ols_graceful_restart.webp" alt="" />

## Downloading and Installing WordPress

1. Enter the web directory of the virtual host:
    ```
    cd /usr/local/lsws/wordpress.example.com/html
    ```
2. Download and unpack the latest WordPress release:
    ```
    wget http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
    tar xvzf latest.tar.gz
    ```
3. Set the ownership of the Wordpress folder and the files within it to the user `nobody` and the group `nogroup`. This is required so that OpenLiteSpeed can modify files within this folder:
    ```
    chown -R nobody:nogroup wordpress
    ```
4. Open a web browser and go to `http://instance_ip/wordpress`. The Wordpress installer displays. Choose the language for your blog and click **Continue**. Wordpress displays some information about the tasks that will be performed by the automatic installer.
