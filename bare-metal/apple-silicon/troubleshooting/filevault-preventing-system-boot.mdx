Apple FileVault is a disk encryption feature. Ensure that FileVault is **not enabled** on your Mac mini. If enabled, it will prevent your system from booting.

To turn off FileVault, go to **System Preferences**, click on **Security**, followed by **FileVault**, then click the button that says **turn off FileVault**.

<Message type="important">
  If FileVault is enabled and your Mac mini reboots for whatever reason, it will ask for the FileVault password during the boot process, before you can access the machine using VNC or SSH. You will **not be able** to restart it or to recover your data if FileVault is enabled.
