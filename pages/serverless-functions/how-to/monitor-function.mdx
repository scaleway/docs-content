Scaleway Serverless Functions is fully integrated into [Cockpit](/cockpit/quickstart/), and allows you to quickly access your logs and metrics. This page explains how to get started with Scaleway Cockpit to monitor your Serverless Functions.

Logs and metrics for Serverless Functions with default retention (31 days for metrics / 7 days for logs & traces) are free of charge.
