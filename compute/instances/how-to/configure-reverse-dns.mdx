Reverse DNS is the opposite of classic "forward" DNS and maps an IP address to a hostname. This can be useful if, for example, you want to send emails from your server.

<Message type="important">
  If you are using the default reverse DNS (*.pub.instances.scw.cloud), you may experience problems with deliverability of your emails and during the subscription of certain tools like [Junk Mail Reporting Program](https://postmaster.live.com/snds/JMRP.aspx) (JMRP) and [Smart Network Data Services](https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/snds/FAQ.aspx#WhatIsSNDS) (SNDS) - services provided by Microsoft to whitelist your IP's on their email servers.

  - You have an account and are logged into [console.scaleway.com](https://console.scaleway.com) 
  - You have [created an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) and have not detached its public (flexible) IP address
  - You have configured a matching `A-record` pointing to your IP address. Note that if you have created the A record recently, it may take up to 24 hours for the operation to be completed.
