  We highly recommend utilizing our name servers for a seamless migration experience:
    * `ns1.whm.fr-par.scw.cloud.`
    * `ns2.whm.fr-par.scw.cloud.`

  If you are managing your DNS zone by yourself, you can locate all the necessary DNS pointers for configuration within the **DNS verification** tab of your Web Hosting in the Scaleway console.

  * Migrating your Web Hosting plan **is a definitive decision**. Once completed, it is not possible to revert back to your previous plan.
  * You must ensure that a [valid payment method has been added](/console/account/how-to/manage-billing-information/) to your Scaleway account before initiating the migration. This is a **mandatory** step to prevent any possible interruption or locking of your web hosting plan during the migration.
