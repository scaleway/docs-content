This page shows you how to deploy a [function](/serverless-functions/concepts/#serverless-functions) using the Scaleway console.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [functions namespace](/serverless-functions/how-to/create-manage-delete-functions-namespace/)

## How to create a function

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.

2. Click the functions namespace in which you want to create your function.

3. Click **+ Create function**. The function creation wizard displays.

### Function configuration

1. Select a runtime for your function. For more information on runtimes configuration and lifecycle, refer to the [dedicated documentation](/serverless-functions/reference-content/functions-runtimes/).

2. Select a function code option:

    - **Inline code editor** to enter your own function code.
    
    - **Deploy "Hello world"** to deploy a basic function that will return "Hello world" when invoked. This option allows you to quickly test a deployment.

    - **Upload a ZIP** to import a [packaged function](/serverless-functions/how-to/package-function-dependencies-in-zip/).

3. If you used the code editor, enter the [handler](/serverless-functions/reference-content/functions-handlers/) of your function.

4. Enter a **name** or use the automatically generated one. The name can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes.

5. Optionally, add a **description** and **tags**.

### Function resources and scaling

1. Select the **resources** to allocate to your function.

2. Configure the **scaling** of your function.
    <Message type="tip">
      Define a minimum of **one instance** or more to avoid [cold starts](/serverless-functions/concepts/#cold-start).
    </Message>

### Function advanced options

In the **Advanced options** section, set the following:

<Tabs>
    <TabsTab label="Data">
    - Declare [environment variables](/serverless-functions/concepts/#environment-variables) you want to inject into your function. For each environment variable, click **+Add variable** and enter the key/value pair.
    - Declare [secrets](/serverless-functions/concepts/#secrets) for your function. Secrets are environment variables that are injected into your function, but the values are not retained or displayed by Scaleway after initial validation.
          <Message type="note">
          Encode your environment variables and secrets to `base64` if they are too large, and contain carriage returns.
          </Message>
    </TabsTab>
    <TabsTab label="Security">
      - Set the desired [privacy policy](/serverless-functions/concepts/#privacy-policy) for your function. This defines whether function invocation may be done anonymously (**public**) or only via an authentication mechanism provided by the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-functions/#authentication) (**private**).
      - Tick the box under **HTTPS connections only** to prevent your function from being called from insecure HTTP connections. All HTTP traffic will be redirected to HTTPS.
    </TabsTab>
    <TabsTab label="Requests">
    - Set a custom [timeout](/serverless-functions/concepts/#request-timeout) for the duration of the requests received by your function.
    </TabsTab>
    <TabsTab label="Performances">
    - Select a [sandbox](/serverless-functions/concepts/#sandbox) version:
        - Sandbox v2 for shorter cold starts (recommended).
        - Sandbox v1 if you require full compatibility with the Linux system call interface (legacy).
    </TabsTab>
</Tabs>

### Function cost and validation

1. Update the **Number of requests** and **Average request duration** fields to simulate the behavior of your function.

2. Verify the **estimated cost**. Refer to the [Serverless Functions pricing](/serverless-functions/faq/#how-am-i-billed-for-serverless-functions) for more information on how billing works.

3. Click **Create function** to finish.

  There are different ways to deploy Serverless Functions. Refer to our detailed [deployment information](/serverless-functions/reference-content/deploy-function/) for more advanced options to deploy your functions.
