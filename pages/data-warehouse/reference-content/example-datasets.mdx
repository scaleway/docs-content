You can test your Scaleway Data Warehouse for ClickHouse® deployment using one of [ClickHouse®'s official example dataset](https://clickhouse.com/docs/getting-started/example-datasets):

- [New York taxi data](https://clickhouse.com/docs/getting-started/example-datasets/nyc-taxi) to quickly test your deployment with a **3 million rows** sample.

- [Stack Overflow data analysis](https://clickhouse.com/docs/getting-started/example-datasets/stackoverflow) to test your deployment with **60 million rows** in a few minutes. We recommend repeating this workflow with various autoscaling configurations to see how vCPU, RAM and nodes affect performance.

- [Environmental sensors data](https://clickhouse.com/docs/getting-started/example-datasets/environmental-sensors) to check the performance over time of your deployment with set of **1.67 TB of uncompressed data (~20 billion rows)**.
