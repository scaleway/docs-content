Upon creation of a bucket on the Scaleway console, you can fill in its use case. Optionally, you can edit this information in the Bucket settings later on. We recommend filling in the bucket use case to unlock personalized recommendations tailored to your needs. We are continuously enhancing our services to further enrich your experience.
