**Discourse** is an open-source internet forum software application, distinguished by its incorporation of features popularized by major social networks.
Developed with **Ember.js** and **Ruby on Rails**, it offers a modern approach to forum management. Behind the scenes, Discourse relies on PostgreSQL for efficient database management.

Released under the GNU General Public License version 2, its source code is freely available on GitHub.
For those looking to set up Discourse, using the official [Docker image](https://github.com/discourse/discourse_docker) streamlines the process. This container encapsulates all necessary components, simplifying deployment, administration, and software updates.

## Installing Discourse

1. Log into your instance using [SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance).
2. Update the `apt` package cache and upgrade the software already installed on the instance to the latest version available in Ubuntu's Repositories:
    ```
    apt update && apt ugprade -y
    ```
3. Install packages required for Discourse:
    ```
    apt install -y git netcat
    ```
4. Clone the Discourse Docker repository into the local directory `/var/discourse`:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse_docker.git /var/discourse
    ```
5. Enter the locally cloned repository:
    ```
    cd /var/discourse
    ```
6. Run the Discourse setup:
    ```
    ./discourse-setup
    ```

    <Message type="important">
      It is **required** that:
        - a valid (sub-)domain is pointed to your instance. **Discourse will not work from an IP address**. If you do not have a domain name yet, you can [order one](https://www.online.net/en/domain) now. Create a subdomain like `discourse.mydomain.com` or `forum.mydomain.com` for your Discourse instance.
        - you have an SMTP server available to send out emails from Discourse. You can either configure [an own SMTP server](/tutorials/setup-postfix-ubuntu-bionic) or use an SMTP service like [SendInBlue](https://www.sendinblue.com/) or [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com/). Make sure that the Instance's [SMTP ports are enabled](https://www.scaleway.com/en/faq/why-can-i-not-send-any-email/). **Discourse will not work if it can not send emails**.

7. Answer the following questions:
    ```
    Hostname for your Discourse? [discourse.example.com]:
    Email address for admin account(s)? [me@example.com,you@example.com]:
    SMTP server address? [smtp.example.com]:
    SMTP port? [587]:
    SMTP user name? [user@example.com]:
    SMTP password? [pa$$word]:
    Let's Encrypt account email? (ENTER to skip) [me@example.com]:
    ```
8. Once all details are entered, a `app.yml` configuration file is being generated on your behalf before bootstrapping the installation. Note that the installation of Discourse may take up to 10 minutes depending on your instance type.

## Configuring the admin user

1. Once the installation is complete, open your web browser and go to your discourse subdomain (i.e. `https://discourse.example.com`). The configuration wizard displays. Click **Register** to create the first (admin) user:

3. Check your email inbox and click the link to confirm your email address and finish the creation of the admin user.
