The Private Network feature of the managed Load Balancers product lets you configure your Load Balancer with a Private Network. [Scaleway Elements Private Networks](/network/vpc/concepts#private-networks) allow your cloud resources to communicate in an isolated and secure network. Load Balancers using Private Networks can communicate with your backend servers without using the public Internet. You can add your Load Balancer to one or multiple existing Private Networks. The feature supports both static IP and DHCP configuration for the Load Balancer IP in the Private Network.

## How to attach a Private Network to your Load Balancer

1. Click [Load Balancers](https://console.scaleway.com/load-balancer/lbs) in the **Network** section of the Scaleway Console side menu. The Load Balancer dashboard displays.

2. Click on the Load Balancer that you want to add to a Private Network. The Load Balancer's overview page displays.

3.  Click the **Private Networks** tab.

4. Click **Attach a Private Network**. A pop up displays.

5. Select the Private Network to attach from the drop down list, then choose the IP configuration for your Load Balancer. You can choose either dynamic configuration using DHCP, or static IP configuration. 

  With dynamic configuration, a DHCP server in your Private Network will automatically assign the IP configuration to your primary and replica Load Balancers. You can set up such a DHCP server by yourself, or use a [Public Gateway](https://console.scaleway.com/vpc/public-gateways). When using static configuration, you can manually assign two IP addresses from your network's IP subnet to the primary and replica Load Balancers.

6. Click **Attach Private Network** to validate the form. The Private Network is attached to the Load Balancer and displays in the **Private Network** tab.

To attach several Private Networks to your Load Balancer, repeat the steps above for each of them. 

## How to detach a Private Network from your Load Balancer
