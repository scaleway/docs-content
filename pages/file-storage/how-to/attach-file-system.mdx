This page explains how to attach a file system to one or several Instances. File systems can only be attached to Instances within the same [region](/file-storage/concepts/#region).

import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a file system](/file-storage/how-to/create-file-system/)
- [Created at least one POP2 Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/)

## How to attach a file system to an Instance

1. Click **File Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. A list of your file systems displays.

2. Click the name of the file system you want to attach. The **Overview** page displays.

3. Open the **Attached Instance(s)**. A list of currently attached Instances displays.

4. Click **Attach an Instance**. A pop-up displays.

5. Select one Instance or more from the drop-down list, then click **Attach** to confirm.

Your file system is now attached to the selected Instance(s) and can now be [mounted](/file-storage/how-to/mount-file-system/) to a Scaleway Instance.
