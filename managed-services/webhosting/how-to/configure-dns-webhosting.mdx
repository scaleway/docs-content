To link your domain name with your Webhosting, you must update the DNS configuration of your domain name to use Scaleway's configuration. Once updated you can verify the configuration to activate your Webhosting.

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have a domain name
</Message>

1. Click **Webhosting** in the **Managed Services** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Webhosting** overview page displays.
2. Click <icon name="seeMore" /> or the domain name of the webhosting you want to configure. The **Hosting information** page displays.
3. Click the **DNS Verification** tab. The DNS configuration page displays.
4. Update your DNS servers. Two options are available:
    - Use Scaleway's DNS servers. 
        We provide DNS servers for your webhosting that contain all required DNS configuration. To use these nameservers, update the nameservers assoicated with your domain name with the servers provided by Scaleway.
    - Manual DNS configuration (advanced).
        If you prefer to continue using your current DNS servers, update the DNS zone at your registrar with all DNS records provided.
    <Message type="note">
        It can take 24 to 48 hours until your DNS updates have been propagated on the Internet.
    </Message>
5. Click **Verify domain** once you have updated your DNS configuration. The DNS verfication process will be launched.
