Edge Services is an additional feature for Scaleway Load Balancers and Object Storage buckets.

<EdgeServicesLbBenefits />

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An active [Edge Services subscription](/edge-services/how-to/subscribe-edge-services/)
- A [Load Balancer](/load-balancer/how-to/create-load-balancer/)

## How to create an Edge Services pipeline for Load Balancer

<Message type="tip">
You can create an Edge Services pipeline from the Load Balancer section of the console, via the **Edge Services** tab there. However, in this documentation, we describe how to create a pipeline directly from the **Edge Services** section of the console.
</Message>

1. Click **Edge Services** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu.

2. Click **Create pipeline**. The pipeline creation wizard displays.
    <Lightbox image={image} alt="A screenshot of the Scaleway console shows the Edge Services pipeline creation wizard. It prompts you to select an origin type (Load Balancer or Object Storage), and configure the other options described below on this page." />

3. Configure the [origin](/edge-services/concepts/#origin) for this pipeline:
    - Select **Load Balancer** as the origin type.
    - Select the **origin Load Balancer** from the dropdown list. The Edge Services pipeline will connect to this Load Balancer when requesting content.
    - Select a **frontend** associated with the origin Load Balancer from the dropdown list. The Edge Services pipeline will connect to the Load Balancer on this port when requesting content. We recommend that you select an HTTPS port, e.g. `443`. Note that if you are creating multiple pipelines for the same origin Load Balancer, each one must be configured for a different frontend.

    <Message type="tip">
    For Kubernetes Load Balancers, see our [dedicated documentation](#help-for-kubernetes-load-balancers) for help selecting the correct Load Balancer and frontend.

    </Message>

4. Define the protocol and origin host for this pipeline:
    - Select the protocol that Edge Services should use when making requests to the origin, either `HTTP` or `HTTPS` (recommended). Choose the protocol that corresponds with your Load Balancer setup.
    - Optionally, enter an [origin host](/edge-services/concepts/#origin-host) associated with your Load Balancer for this pipeline. When specified, this host replaces the Load Balancer IP address in the HTTP Host Header of the requests made from Edge Services to your Load Balancer.

5. Enter a name for this Edge Services pipeline, or leave the auto-generated name in place.

6. Optionally, configure **Advanced Settings:**
    - **Cache**: When enabled, content from your Load Balancer origin is cached with Edge Services and served directly to users from Edge Services' servers. Set a **Lifetime** value, in seconds, to dictate how long objects should remain in the cache before being freshly retrieved from the origin. [Find out more about caching](/edge-services/how-to/configure-cache/).
    - **WAF**: When enabled, requests to your Load Balancer origin are evaluated by a **W**eb **A**pplication **F**irewall. Malicious requests are blocked or logged, depending on your settings. Set a paranoia level to determine WAF's aggressivity, and a mode (block or log) for dealing with malicious requests. [Find out more about WAF](/edge-services/reference-content/understanding-waf/).

    The summary cost for the creation of this pipeline is displayed, notably whether it falls within the limits of your current [subscription plan](/edge-services/reference-content/understanding-pricing/)

7. Click **Create Edge Services pipeline** to finish.

    You are returned to the **Pipelines** tab, where the newly created pipeline now displays. 

    Click on the pipeline to go to its **Overview** page and start configuration. From the **Overview**, you can see the endpoint from which you can access your Load Balancer origin via Edge Services, e.g. `https://pipeline-id.svc.edge.scw.cloud`.

## Troubleshooting pipeline creation

If you see the message `Edge Services was unable to contact the host via the Load Balancer. Please check your origin configuration settings and try again`, check the following elements of your configuration:

- **Protocol**: Ensure you did not select the wrong protocol, e.g. HTTP selected while the frontend chosen is configured to receive HTTPS, or the opposite.
- **Origin host**: Ensure that you entered the correct origin host, with no typos, for a host that exists behind the selected Load Balancer.
- **Load Balancer ACLs**: Ensure that there are no [ACLs](/load-balancer/how-to/create-manage-acls/) configured on your Load Balancer which are blocking traffic from Edge Services.

## Help for Kubernetes Load Balancers

If you are setting up an Edge Services pipeline for a [Kubernetes Kapsule](/kubernetes) Load Balancer, follow these steps to determine which Load Balancer and frontend to configure for your pipeline:

1. Run `kubectl describe svc`.

    An output displays.

2. Locate the section of the output that relates to your LoadBalancer service. It should look something like this:

    ```
    Name:                     myloadbalancer
    Namespace:                default
    Labels:                   app=mydeployment
    Annotations:              service.beta.kubernetes.io/scw-loadbalancer-id: fr-par-1/a92de52e-262f-99f9-be66-5220003a2e42
    Selector:                 app=mydeployment
    Type:                     LoadBalancer
    IP Family Policy:         SingleStack
    IP Families:              IPv4
    IP:                       10.32.220.60
    IPs:                      10.32.220.60
    LoadBalancer Ingress:     51.159.25.111
    Port:                     http  8000/TCP
    TargetPort:               8000/TCP
    NodePort:                 http  32041/TCP
    Endpoints:                
    Session Affinity:         None
    External Traffic Policy:  Cluster
    ```
3. Find the `service.beta.kubernetes.io/scw-loadbalancer-id` annotation, and note your Load Balancer ID (e.g. `a92de52e-262f-99f9-be66-5220003a2e42`). Check your Load Balancer list in the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/load-balancer/lbs) to find the Load Balancer name that corresponds to this ID. This is the Load Balancer you should select for the Edge Services pipeline.

4. Find the **NodePort** line and note the port mentioned (in the case above, `32041`). In the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/load-balancer/lbs), find the frontend of the Load Balancer from step 3 that corresponds with this port. This is the frontend and port you should select for the Edge Services pipeline.

## How to edit an Edge Services pipeline origin

You can edit the protocol, origin host, and name of an Edge Services pipeline as follows.

1. Click **Load Balancers** in the **Network** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of your Load Balancers displays.

2. Click the **Edge Services** tab.

3. Click the Edge Services pipeline you want to edit. The **Overview** page for the pipeline displays.

4. In the top right corner, click **Edit**. A pop-up displays.

    <Lightbox image={image2} alt="A screenshot of the Scaleway console displays, showing a screen for editing an Edge Services Load Balancer pipeline. Modifiable elements are protocol, origin host and name" />

5. Make the edits required. You can:
    - Change the **protocol**
    - Change the **origin host**
    - Change the pipeline **name**

6. Click **Save**.
