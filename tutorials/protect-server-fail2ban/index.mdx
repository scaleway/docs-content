Fail2Ban is a useful tool that analyses server log files for recurring patterns of failures. This allows blocking IPs trying to run brute force attacks against a server.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to configure the service on an Ubuntu Bionic server to protect the SSH service. Fail2Ban can be used with all services generating log files.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An Ubuntu Bionic [Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/)
- `sudo` privileges or access to the root user

## Installing Fail2Ban

1. The required packages are available in the repositories of Ubuntu and can be installed with `apt`:
    ```
    sudo apt-get install fail2ban postfix
    ```
2. Choose `Internet Site` when asked for the configuration:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-postfix-install.webp" alt="" />
3. Once the installation has completed, open the file `/etc/aliases` and add the following line:
    ```
    root: me@mydomain.tld
    ```

  Make sure to replace `me@mydomain.tld` with your actual email address.

## Configuring Fail2Ban

1. Start by copying the configuration file:
    ```
    cd /etc/fail2ban && sudo cp jail.conf jail.local
    ```

  The file `jail.conf` contains the default parameters. If a file `jail.local` is available, it will have priority over `jail.conf` if parameters are modified.
2. Edit the file `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local` with your preferred editor.

    Following are the parameters which should be modified:
    - `ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8` - By default the IPs of localhost are ignored, self-banning would not be very useful. It is possible to exclude other IPs from being banned.
    - `bantime = 600` - The duration of a ban. By default, it is set to 10 Minutes. The value has to be specified in seconds and it is recommended to set it at least to one hour, or one day.
    - `findtime = 600` - The timespan which will be considered for maxretry. If you want for example to ban somebody who made more than 3 malicious attempts during the last hour or, as here, in the last 10 minutes.
    - `maxretry = 3` - Amount of attempts before being banned.
    - `destemail = root@localhost` - The recipient of the mail. As an alias for root has been set during the installation, this value can be left as it is.
    - `sendername = Fail2Ban` - The name of the sender of the mail.
    - `action = %(action_)s` - This defines the action to execute when a limit is reached.
        By default, it will only block the user.

        To receive an email at each ban, set it to:

        - `action = %(action_mw)`

        To receive the logs with the mail, set it to:

        - `action = %(action_mwl)`

    Further down in the configuration file, it comes to the “Jails”. These are configurable blocks per service to filter logs and ban in cases where patterns are matched.
    As a minimum, it is recommended to activate the jail ssh as follows:
      ```
      [ssh]

      enabled  = true
      port     = ssh
      filter   = sshd
      logpath  = /var/log/auth.log
      ```

      <Message type="tip">
        If your SSH daemon is listening on multiple ports or a different port, you have to modify the line port with the correct parameters:
        For example:
        ```
        port = ssh,1234
        ```
        Fail2Ban analyses the logs and will ban the users who made several intrusion attempts on ports 22 (SSH by default) & 1234.

3. Save the file once you have edited it.

    Fail2Ban uses filters, pre-made configuration files indicating what to parse in a log.

    They can be found in `/etc/fail2ban/filter.d`.
    You can create your own filters in case you need to.
4. Restart the service to take the actions into effect:
    ```
    sudo service fail2ban restart
    ```

The service will now analyze the connections made to the SSH service. The logs of Fail2Ban are located in the file `var/log/fail2ban.log`.
