Serverless SQL Database is based on PostgreSQL engine and thus provides standard PostgreSQL compatibility for most PostreSQL features and commands. Due to the nature of a managed service, autoscaling support and connection pooling support, some features are not currently supported. This means either the corresponding SQL command will not be authorized or will not behave similarly to a standard PostgreSQL instance.

If you require strict PostgreSQL features compatibility, you can use [Managed database for PostgreSQL](link to managed database).

## SQL Features

`NOTIFY` and `LISTEN` commands can be performed, but messages delivery isn't guaranteed. Example:

    ```
    LISTEN channel;
    NOTIFY channel, 'message';
    ```

Creating temporary table or views is not supported. Example:

    ```
    CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE table as {query};
    CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW view as {query};
    ```

Refreshing materialized view concurrenlty cannot be performed. Refreshing materialized view is supported without the `CONCURRENTLY` option. Example:

    ```
    REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY view
    ```
Asynchronous commands such as PQsendQuery and PQgetResult cannot be performed.

Declaring a cursor in transactions with `WITH HOLD` is not supported. Example:

    ```
    BEGIN;
    DECLARE cursor CURSOR WITH HOLD FOR {query};
    COMMIT;
    ```

Creating subscriptions cannot be performed. Example:

```
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION subscription CONNECTION 'connection' PUBLICATION publication;
```

Preparing transactions is not supported. Example:

```
PREPARE TRANSACTION 'transactionid';
```

## Configuration commands

DDL queries on objects such as database and users cannot be performed. Corresponding actions can be performed directly in Serverless [SQL Database Console](link to SQL Database in Console), API, Terraform and [IAM](link to IAM). Example:

```
CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE DATABASE database;
CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE USER username;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE table TO role;
REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE table FROM role;
```

`SET` or `RESET` commands changing run-time configuration parameters can be performed, but will be shared across multiple clients and might be lost when database switches to idle state or during autoscaling operations. Example:

```
SET TIME ZONE 'Europe/Paris';
```

Security labels cannot be defined or changed. Example:

```
SECURITY LABEL FOR provider ON TABLE table IS 'label';
```
