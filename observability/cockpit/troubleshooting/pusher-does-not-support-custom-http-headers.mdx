If your pusher does not support the `X-Token` header, there are other ways to pass it:

- Through the `X-Scope-OrgID` header. This means that when using [Promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/), you can set the `tenant_id` field of the client's configuration to pass the token.
- Through the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. This is for all clients who usually have support for these bearer tokens.
- Through the `Authorization: Basic` header. With basic authentication you will have to use the token as a password with any username.
