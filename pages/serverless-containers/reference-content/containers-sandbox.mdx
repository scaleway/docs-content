In the context of Scaleway Serverless Containers, a [Sandbox environment](/serverless-containers/concepts/#sandbox) is a critical security mechanism that isolates each container from others, ensuring that they operate in a secure and controlled space. Containers run in dedicated execution environments that preventing unauthorized access and potential interference between different resources.

Scaleway Serverless Containers offers two sandbox environment options:

- Sandbox v1 (legacy)
- Sandbox v2 (recommended)

## Sandbox v1

Sandbox v1 is Serverless Containers' legacy sandboxing environment with slower [cold starts](/serverless-containers/concepts/#cold-start), but fully supports Linux system call interface. This option is recommended when processing large amounts of *syscalls*.

## Sandbox v2

Sandbox v2 is a modern isolation environment that relies on [gVisor](https://gvisor.dev/). This option offers faster [cold starts](/serverless-containers/concepts/#cold-start), but only implements a selection of Linux syscalls.
Refer to the [official gVisor documentation](https://gvisor.dev/docs/user_guide/compatibility/linux/amd64/) for a comprehensive list of supported syscalls.
