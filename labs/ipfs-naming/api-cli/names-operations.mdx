Created by [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/), InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a decentralized protocol used to store and share content.

Scaleway IPFS Naming allows you to create a key to point to your latest update, and above all maintain this information on the IPFS network and share it through Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs), giving you an extra layer of performance in the region of your choice. This way your records remain available and accessible, even when your local machine is offline.

In this quickstart, we will show you how to create and import an IPNS key and update your records using Scaleway IPFS Naming.

## Scaleway Command Line Interface overview

The [Scaleway Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli) allows you to create and interact with your names. You will be able to create names, manage them, and add/delete value within them.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
    - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
    - You have generated your [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
    - You have downloaded and installed the [Scaleway CLI v2](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli#scaleway-cli-v2)
</Message>

## Configuring the CLI

1. Open a terminal and enter the following command, to configure the Scaleway CLI on your machine:
    ```
    scw init
    ```

    If you have already configured the CLI, you will see a message like the following:

    ```
    Current config is located at /path/to/config.yaml
    access_key: <YOUR ACCESS KEY>
    secret_key: <YOUR SECRET KEY>
    default_organization_id: <YOUR ORGANIZATION ID>
    default_project_id: <YOUR PROJECT ID>
    default_region: <YOUR DEFAULT REGION, eg fr-par>
    default_zone: <YOUR DEFAULT ZONE, eg fr-par-1>

    Do you want to override the current config? (Y/n):
    ```

    <Message type="note">
        As the project is available on pl-waw, nl-ams and fr-par, you can set the region to pl-waw, nl-ams or fr-par.
    </Message>

2. Unless you want to change your configuration, you can type `n` and go directly to the [Creating a Name](#creating-a-name) step of this tutorial.
    If you have not yet configured the CLI, you will be guided through the configuration process via a series of questions:

    ```
    Enter a valid secret-key or an email
    ```
3. Enter either the email address for your account (you will then be asked for your password), or your [API secret key](/console/project/how-to/create-ssh-key/):
    ```
    To improve this tool we rely on diagnostic and usage data.
    Sending such data is optional and can be disabled at any time by running "scw config set send-telemetry=false".
    Do you want to send usage statistics and diagnostics? (Y/n):
    ```

    Type `y` or `n` and hit enter.

    ```
    To fully enjoy Scaleway CLI we recommend you install autocomplete support in your shell.
    Do you want to install autocomplete? (Y/n):
    ```

    Type `y` or `n` and hit enter.

    ```
    To enable autocomplete, scw needs to update your shell configuration.
    What type of shell are you using (default: zsh):
    ```
4. Hit enter if the default shell type is already correct for you. Otherwise, enter your shell type and hit enter.
    ```
    To enable autocomplete we need to append to /Users/yourusername/.zshrc the following lines:
    # Scaleway CLI autocomplete initialization.
    eval "$(scw autocomplete script shell=zsh)"
    Do you want to proceed with these changes? (Y/n):
    ```

    Type `y` or `n` and hit enter. This should complete the configuration process:

    ```
     Initialization completed with success.
    ```

## Creating a name

This operation allows you to create a new key. A [key](/labs/ipfs-naming/concepts/#name), which corresponds to the keys you will create to manage your records.

Type the following command to create your key using the CLI.

```
scw ipns name create name=my-website value=QmULjVfvvMf3v637XLQuBoYqchFC5MCPYLJmVeTMVcACK2
```

You should get a response like the following, providing details about your newly created name.

```
NameID $NAME_ID
ProjectID 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
Region fr-par
Key -
CreatedAt now
UpdatedAt now
Name my-website
Status queued
Value QmULjVfvvMf3v637XLQuBoYqchFC5MCPYLJmVeTMVcACK2
```

Alternatively, you can also run the following API command. Make sure to replace the values with your own, using the API configuration table below.

```
curl -X POST \
 -H "X-Auth-Token: $SECRET_KEY" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 "https://api.scaleway.com/ipfs/v1alpha1/regions/$REGION_ID/names" \
 -d '{
