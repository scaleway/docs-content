## My Database Instance is unavailable

## Problem

My Database Instance is unavailable.

## Possible causes

- High data loads
- High incoming traffic from specific apps or websites

## Solution

You can monitor your Database Instance activity to be able to quickly identify and act on irregular activities that might be causing the instability/unavailability.

[Monitor usage metrics on Cockpit](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/monitor-databases-cockpit) to:

    - Check if the usage is regular. Database Instance can be impacted by high data loads or unexpected high traffic from an app or website, for example
    - Check if there are slow queries in the Database Instance log. Huge or sub-optimized queries can fill up all the memory and trigger OOM kills
    - Check the Database Instance logs for any unusual or suspicious activity

## My Database Instance is in a stuck state

## Problem

My Database Instance is currently in a stuck state.

## Possible causes

- A maintenance operation on Scaleway's side is taking longer than usual and timed out, making the Database Instance go into a transitional state

## Solution

If the Database Instance is sent to a transitional state, the Scaleway Databases team receives an alert and will act on the issue as soon as possible.

If you observe the resolution is taking longer than usual, [create a support ticket](/account/how-to/open-a-support-ticket/#writing-an-effective-subject-and-description) to let us know.
