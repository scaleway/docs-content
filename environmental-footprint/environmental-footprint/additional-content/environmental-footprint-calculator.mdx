This page details the methodology used to calculate the environmental footprint of Scaleway cloud services, and Bare Metal offers. This methodology ensures transparency and precision, as it provides reliable estimations covering a full lifecycle analysis.

## Methodology Overview

Our Methodology is based on the [ADEME Product Category Rules (PCR)](https://librairie.ademe.fr/produire-autrement/6105-methodological-standard-for-the-environmental-assessment-of-datacenter-it-hosting-services-and-cloud-services.html) for Datacenter and Cloud services, which provide a standardized framework for calculating and reporting the environmental impact of datacenters and cloud services. These rules are designed to ensure consistency, transparency, and comparability in the assessment of environmental footprints across the industry.

The ADEME PCR specifies the methodology for conducting Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) for datacenter operations, which includes the evaluation of energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, resource usage, and other environmental impacts associated with the lifecycle of datacenter infrastructures and cloud services. This lifecycle covers all stages from raw material extraction, manufacturing, and transportation, to the use and end-of-life disposal of datacenter equipment.

By adhering to PCR guidelines, we provide reliable and standardized environmental impact data. This facilitates better decision-making for both providers and consumers of datacenter and cloud services, as it allows for clear comparisons and informed choices regarding sustainability.

However, to provide a more comprehensive and realistic assessment, we have extended this methodology to include several additional elements that are integral to the overall environmental impact of our operations.

These additional elements cover:

- **Cross-functional IT equipment** - Servers and storage devices dedicated to the enterprise as a whole, managing offers, or equipment held in stock. This includes: 
    - **Enterprise servers and storage devices** - IT equipment dedicated to Scaleway's internal digital services
    - **Servers and storage devices for managing offers** - IT equipment for management and supervision of Scaleway offers
    - **Servers and storage equipment in stock** - IT equipment in stock and waiting to be commissioned
- **Non-IT cross-functional elements** - all components necessary for the smooth operation of our company, such as office facilities, employee transportation, and other logistics. Refer to our [2024 Environmental Impact Report](https://www.scaleway.com/en/environmental-leadership/?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_term=&utm_content=&utm_campaign=default) for more information about these components.

By integrating these additional factors into the PCR Datacenter and cloud methodology, we ensure that our calculations reflect a more complete and transparent view of our environmental impact.

## Detailed Calculation Breakdown

The final calculation of the environmental impact considers several critical factors to provide a thorough and accurate assessment. This includes considering the manufacturing processes for datacenters and related technical components, network machines, and servers directly used by clients. Additionally, the assessment accounts for servers dedicated to IT tools and those maintained in stock.

The usage phase also includes the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), which is multiplied by the impact of the usage of network servers, client-used servers, and servers used for transversal IT tools. This approach ensures that both the direct and indirect energy consumption associated with datacenter operations is accurately represented.

Furthermore, the calculation will integrate the environmental impact of all elements necessary for the proper functioning of the enterprise. This includes the office premises, employee transportation, and other logistical aspects.

### Datacenter and technical environment

To calculate the impact of the datacenter and the technical environment, it is necessary to have either a preliminary study carried out by the hardware suppliers and datacenter administrators or a quote including all the components. Without such a study, we introduce even more uncertainty in our approximations. We have chosen to use ADEME data to evaluate the impact of the construction of the datacenter and thus use the value 825kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq/m2 (source). Concerning the technical environment (air conditioning and power supply system), there is no public emission factor based on the surface area. We can assume that the manufacture of the technical environment has a similar footprint to that of the building; we use the same emission factor as for the building and add them together.

To allocate the environmental impact of the manufacturing of the datacenter and the technical environment we multiply the proportion of the datacenter lifespan that corresponds to the device's usage time by the specific equipment's power usage relative to the total power reserved by customers in the datacenter by the datacenter emission factor.

Datacenter and technical environment manufacturing values: 

<Message type="note">
    The abbreviations used below are based on the French phrases for these terms.

**Impact estimation:**
    - dU = 1 hour
    - DDV_DC = 25 years
    - PuissEqt = electrical consumption estimate value, stored in Akeneo 
    - PuissCommDC = Sum of "Electrical Consumption Estimation" of all servers of the product on the datacenter
    - FE = 2 x 825kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq * m2

**Impact usage values:**
    - dU = you can get this data from Billing API for impact usage
    - DDV_DC = 25 years
    - PuissEqt = get data from servers (cf ADR - Electricity consumption monitoring agents)
    - PuissCommDC = Sum of the **electrical consumption estimation** of all servers of the product in the datacenter
    - FE = 2x85kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq * m2

### Network

For the network, we can distinguish different levels of mutualization:

  - **The backbone** - used to ensure the network connection between Availability Zones (AZs) of the same region. Its impact must, therefore, be distributed over all the servers of the same region
  - **The fabric** - used to ensure the network connection between different servers of the same AZ, its impact must therefore be distributed across all servers of the same region
  - **The leaves** - used to ensure the network connection to each rack, its impact must therefore be distributed over the different servers of the rack

The total impact of the network to be allocated is the sum of all the machines that constitute these three types of network machines.

We will then be able to allocate the impact of manufacturing network servers by adding up:

- The impact of all the machines in the backbone, to which we apply a mutualization factor based on the electrical power of all the datacenters that make up the region
- The sum of the impact of all the machines in the fabric, to which we apply a mutualization factor based on the electrical power of the datacenter
- The sum of the impact of all the machines in the leaves of the rack on which the server is located

Then we will apply a mutualization factor based on the electrical power of the datacenter. The same applies to the usage part, where these three network levels must also be considered.

### Customer servers

To accurately calculate the environmental impact of each server used directly for Scaleway offers, we will implement specific allocation rules tailored to each product. These rules will ensure that the impact is precisely distributed according to the unique usage patterns and resource demands of different products.

Each product will have its own set of criteria to allocate the environmental footprint, considering factors such as server utilization rates, operational timeframes, and the specific technical requirements of the product. By customizing the allocation rules for each offering, we can ensure a more accurate and fair representation of the environmental impact associated with each product.

### Bare Metal

For bare metal servers, the allocation of environmental impact is straightforward due to the direct association between a user and a server. The environmental impact of a bare metal server is entirely attributed to the user utilizing it. This encompasses the energy consumption during its operation, as well as a portion of the impact from the server's manufacturing process.

The manufacturing impact is prorated based on the server's lifespan and the duration of its use by the client. By dividing the total manufacturing impact by the expected lifetime of the server and then allocating it according to the specific usage period, we ensure that each user is accountable for their fair share of the server's overall environmental footprint.

### Cross-IT Equipment & stock

Our calculation will also incorporate the environmental footprint of all transversal tools essential for the functioning of the Scaleway, such as: 

- Account
- API Gateway
- Billing
- Customers success
- Hardware
- Helpdesk
- IAM
- Internal services
- IT Data Automation
- Payment
- Platform hardware orchestration
- Platform Managed services
- Platform observability
- Security
- Tooling
- Internal Databases
- Front development
- Devtools
- Event Buses
- Product catalog
- Website development
- Production Incidents
- Production operations
- The Environmental Footprint tool itself

For Dedibox, only the following tools are considered: 

- Customers success
- Hardware
- Helpdesk
- Internal services
- Security
- Website development
- Production Incidents
- Production operations
- The Environmental Footprint tool itself

The elements listed above encompass a comprehensive list of resources that support various internal operations and services. 

To determine their manufacturing impact, we add the environmental footprint of each machine hosting these transversal tools over the duration of client usage. This aggregated impact will then be divided by the total number of clients. A "customer" is defined as an active organization, that is to say an organization which consumes and which is billed.

To determine stock manufacturing impact, we will divide the sum of the impact of all hardware components in stock by the total number of servers.

### Non-IT cross-functional elements

Finally, our comprehensive environmental impact calculation will include the "Non-IT cross-functional elements." This category encompasses the environmental footprint of all other essential components required for Scaleway's operations, such as office facilities, employee transportation, the company cafeteria, and various logistical aspects.

To integrate this into the overall calculation, we will first get the total environmental impact of these non-IT elements from Scaleway Impact report. This total impact will then be divided by the number of clients. This approach ensures that every client shares a portion of the environmental burden associated with maintaining the broader operational infrastructure, thereby providing a complete and transparent picture of Scaleway's environmental footprint.
