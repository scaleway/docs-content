Scaleway [Elastic Metal servers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/elastic-metal/) provide on-demand dedicated servers similar to cloud instances. These servers are ideal for large workloads, big data, and applications requiring enhanced security and dedicated resources.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)

### Steps to create an Elastic Metal server

1. Go to **Elastic Metal** in the **Bare Metal** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Elastic Metal server creation page displays.

    - Enter a name and, optionally, add tags to identify your server.
    - Add your SSH key (required if installing an image on your server). Depending on the OS image, you may also be asked to configure the panel user for your server.
    - Optionally, configure the available public bandwidth for your server. This option may not be available for all offers.
    - Optionally, decide whether to enable the Private Networks feature. [Learn more about Private Networks](/network/vpc/concepts/#private-networks)
    - Review the estimated cost based on your selected configuration.
