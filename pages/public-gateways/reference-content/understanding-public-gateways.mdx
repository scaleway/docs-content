This document sets out the features and use cases of Public Gateways, and provides further information on pricing and technical details.

## Overview

Scaleway Public Gateways facilitate secure internet access for your resources deployed within Private Networks.

<Lightbox image={pgwDiag} alt="A diagram shows how a Public Gateway acts as a bridge to the public internet, for resources in Private Networks." />

On a technical level, a Public Gateway is a managed network component, configured by Scaleway to enable connectivity between a Private Network and the public internet. A Public Gateway functions as a gateway node, that performs several key netowrking tasks, including traffic forwarding, NAT (**N**etwork **A**ddress **T**raslation) and SSH bastion services. Public Gateways enhance security by allowing you to place your resources in Private Networks without losing vital access to the public internet.

### Outbound internet access via route advertisement and dynamic NAT

You can set the Public Gateway to [advertise a default route](TODO), meaning that all outbound internet traffic from resources on the Private Network is automatically sent to the Public Gateway.

Enabling **dynamic NAT** means that as such traffic reaches the gateway, the origin resource's private IP address (and a unique port), are automatically mapped and translated to the Public Gateway's public IP address and an ephemeral port. This allows the traffic to be securely routed on the public internet, and ensures the gateway can correctly route return traffic back to the original requester.

### Inbound internet access via static NAT

Go further by configuring **static NAT** to permanently expose a single resource in the Private Network to the internet. You can create multiple static NAT configurations to map specific private IP address/port combinations to the Public Gateway's public IP address and a port. This is ideal for resources hosting services that need to be reachable from the internet (inbound connections), and provides predictable, addressable connectivity beyond the ephemeral nature of dynamic NAT.

### Administrative access via SSH bastion

Public Gateway's **SSH bastion** feature allows you to establish secure SSH connections to resources in a Private Network, even after you have removed their public IP addresses. The bastion server serves as a controlled entry point for SSH access to resources in the Private Network. 

When you activate SSH bastion on your Public Gateway, all SSH keys held in your Scaleway Project are imported to the SSH bastion, providing a single point of entry. You can then connect to resources connected to the same Private Network as the Public Gateway, via the bastion. This makes management of your infrastructure easier and more secure, as you do not need to expose your resources to the internet in order to connect to them, neither do you need to upload SSH keys to individual resources.

## Use cases 

| Use Case                                                 | Description                       |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Enhance security through network isolation**               | Run sensitive services and store confidential data on resources attached to a Private Network, without public IP addresses exposing them to the internet. Attack surface and risk of unauthorized access are reduced as there is no direct entry point, while resources can still securely download updates and send logs via the Public Gateway.  |
| **Reduce costs by stripping resources of public IPs**        | Removing resources' public IP addresses and attaching them to a Private Network with a Public Gateway facilitating internet access not only enhances security, but also reduces cost. Private IP addresses are not billed by Scaleway, whereas public ([flexible](TODO)) IP addresses attract an hourly billing rate. A Public Gateway with a single public (flexible) IP address can securely "share" that address with multiple private resources, thanks to dynamic and static NAT.  |
| **Optimize administrative connectivity**                   |  Engineering teams often need secure administrative access to large numbers of private resources in a Private Network. SSH bastion provides a secure, single point of entry to these private resources. This makes management of your infrastructure easier and more secure, as you do not need to upload each engineer's SSH key to each individual resource: all SSH keys held in your Project are automatically imported to the SSH bastion.  |

## Technical info: requirements and availability

This section sets out how you can use the Public Gateway with other Scaleway resources, and details its availability, compatibility and limitations.

### Requirements

You can create a Public Gateway as soon as you've created your Scaleway account and added a payment method.

Remember that a Public Gateway is functionally useless until it is attached to a Private Network. 

In practical terms, you will need to [create a VPC](TODO), then [create a Private Network](TODO) inside the VPC. You can then [attach the Public Gateway](TODO) to the Private Network, along with [other resources](TODO) such as Instances, Elastic Metal servers etc. The Public Gateway can then provide secure internet access to the other resources on the attached Private Network.

### Availability

Public Gateways are available in multiple different Availability Zones. For the most up-to-date information, check out the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/public-gateway/public-gateways/create) or the [Product Availability](/account/reference-content/products-availability/) page.

### Limitations and compatibility

- Public Gateways currently support only IPv4. This means a Public Gateway can have only a public IPv4 address, and can only forward IPv4 traffic.
- Public Gateways can forward traffic for all resources that are [compatible with Scaleway Private Networks](/vpc/reference-content/getting-most-private-networks/#resource-specific-information).
- Static NAT is not compatible with Managed Databases for PostgreSQL and MySQL

## Pricing

Public Gateways are priced at an hourly rate. The rate differs based on the Public Gateway offer type you choose. Offer types vary by **bandwidth**, i.e. the maximum data transfer capacity the gateway can handle at any given time. The higher the bandwidth capacity, the higher the hourly rate. You can [upgrade your Public Gateway](TODO) to a more powerful offer type at any time.

You are billed for a Public Gateway from the moment you create it, until you delete it. You can [delete](TODO) a Public Gateway at any time. Note that the public flexible IP of a Public Gateway incurs separate billing to the gateway itself.

## Features

Public Gateway offers the following features:

- **Advertisement of a default route** (enable/disable) - let other resources on the Private Network automatically find a route to the internet via the gateway.
- **Dynamic NAT** (enable/disable) - automatic mapping of resources' private IPs/ports to the Public Gateway, allowing secure routing of outbound traffic on the internet, and ensuring return traffic is routed back to the original requester.
- **Static NAT** (manually add multiple NAT rules) - map specific private IP address/port combinations to the Public Gateway, to permanently expose resources to the public internet for inbound traffic.
- **SSH bastion** (enable/disable, and define which public IPs can access resources behind the bastion)
- **Upgrade Public Gateway** to a more powerful offer type
