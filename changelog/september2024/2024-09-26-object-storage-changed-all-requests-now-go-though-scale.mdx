The rollout of the new gateway is now complete in all regions. HTTP `PUT` requests now also go through the new gateway, leading to a significant performance improvement, especially on p50 and p90 percentiles. The next updates will bring further improvements to p95, p99 and p99.9 percentiles for the `PUT` method.
