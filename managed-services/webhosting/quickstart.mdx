Web Hosting is a service that allows individuals and organizations to make their website accessible on the internet. It involves storing website files and data on a server, which is connected to the internet and enables users to access the website through a web browser.

Scaleway provides several [Web Hosting plans](https://www.scaleway.com/en/web-hosting/) for individuals, professionals, and everyone in between.

All Scaleway Web Hosting plans use a user-friendly Web Hosting control panel tool. This interface provides users with intuitive graphical navigation and quick access icons for configuring and monitoring their hosting solutions. With features like website publishing, database launching, email creation, and file management, users can efficiently manage their hosting tasks through this interface, ensuring elevated performance.

## How to configure DNS for Web Hosting

To link your domain name with your Web Hosting plan you have to update the nameservers in the DNS configuration at your registrar. Nameservers are servers used to translate domain names into IP addresses. When you enter a URL in a browser, they show you where the website is located, instead of memorizing entire numerical sequences in the form of IP addresses.

<Message type="important">
  If you are migrating from another web hosting provider to Scaleway Web Hosting, you might need to [update your nameserver information](/managed-services/webhosting/how-to/configure-dns-webhosting/) with the information available in your console.
</Message>

1. Click **Web Hosting** in the **Managed Services** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Web Hosting** overview page displays.
2. Click <Icon name="seeMore" /> or the domain name of the Web Hosting you want to configure. The **Hosting information** page displays.
3. Click the **DNS Verification** tab. The DNS configuration page displays.
4. Update your DNS servers. Two options are available:
    - Use Scaleway's DNS servers. 
        We provide DNS servers for your Web Hosting plan that contain all required DNS configuration. To use these nameservers, update the nameservers associated with your domain name with the servers provided by Scaleway.
    - Manual DNS configuration (advanced).
        If you prefer to continue using your current DNS servers, update the DNS zone at your registrar with all DNS records provided.
    <Message type="note">
        It can take 24 to 48 hours until your DNS updates are propagated on the internet.
    </Message>
5. Click **Verify domain** once you have updated your DNS configuration. The DNS verification process will be launched.
    Once the process has been completed successfully, you will notice a green dot next to **DNS verification**. Your DNS is now configured and linked with your Web Hosting plan.
