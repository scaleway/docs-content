## What is the Scaleway Documentation Platform?

The goal of this platform is to provide you with information about all the resources in the Scaleway Ecosystem and the procedures you should follow to get the best experience from our products and services. You will find several types of content.

**Concepts:** we explain a core concept in simple terms.

**Quickstarts:** we give a shortened version of a How to which enables you to have access to the most common instructions.

**How-tos:** we explain how to create and manage all your resources from the Scaleway console.

**Tutorials:** we explain how to use your Scaleway resources with third-party tools.

**CLIs documentation:** we explain how to manage your Scaleway products in your code or command line.

**Reference documentation:** we provide pertinent details about a specific subject.

The website's staging environment is accessible at: https://scaleway-docs.s3-website.fr-par.scw.cloud/
