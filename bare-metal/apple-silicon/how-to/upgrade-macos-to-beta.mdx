        Reverting from a macOS beta version to a previous stable version without reinstalling the operating system entirely is not officially supported by Apple. The only way to revert is to perform a full [reinstallation](/bare-metal/apple-silicon/how-to/reinstall-mac-mini/) of the previous macOS version.
