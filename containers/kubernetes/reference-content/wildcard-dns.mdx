Kubernetes wildcard DNS refers to a DNS configuration that allows for routing any subdomain of a domain to a particular service or set of services within a Kubernetes cluster. A wildcard DNS record is usually indicated by an asterisk (*), for example: `*.yourdomain.com`.

Using wildcard DNS with Kubernetes has several advantages:

- Without wildcard DNS, each time you deploy a new service and want to expose it with a domain name, you'd have to create a new DNS record. With wildcard DNS, any subdomain of `yourdomain.com` (like `service1.yourdomain.com`, `service2.yourdomain.com`, etc.) will automatically resolve to the IP address specified in the wildcard record.
- Wildcard DNS is especially useful for development and staging environments where you might frequently spin up and tear down services. The wildcard DNS ensures that these services get valid DNS names without additional configuration.
- When used in conjunction with an ingress controller (like Nginx or Traefik), wildcard DNS can be powerful. The ingress controller can route traffic based on the hostname, meaning that while the wildcard DNS points all subdomains to the ingress controller, the controller itself determines which service should handle the request based on its configuration.

In short, Kubernetes wildcard DNS, combined with an ingress controller, provides a powerful way to dynamically route external traffic to different services in the cluster based on hostname patterns.

## Installing the ingress controller with helm

1. Add the Helm repository:
   ```bash
   helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
   helm repo update
   ```

2. Install the Nginx ingress controller using the helm packet manager:
   ```bash
   helm install nginx-ingress ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx \
     --namespace ingress-nginx --create-namespace
   ```

3. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx
   ```

## Configuring wildcard DNS

1. Retrieve the ingress IP:
   ```bash
   kubectl get svc -n ingress-nginx
   ```
   <Message type="note">
      It may take a few minutes for the Load Balancer IP to be assigned.
   </Message>

2. Configure Wildcard DNS:
   - Go to your DNS provider and add an A record for `*.yourdomain.com` pointing to the IP address of the ingress controller's load balancer.

## Deploy a sample application

1. Deploy a sample application by creating a file `hello-world.yaml`. Below is a simple deployment and service example. Copy the content in the file and save it:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: apps/v1
     kind: Deployment
     metadata:
       name: hello-world
     spec:
       replicas: 2
       selector:
         matchLabels:
           app: hello-world
       template:
         metadata:
           labels:
             app: hello-world
         spec:
           containers:
           - name: hello-world
             image: nginxdemos/hello
             ports:
             - containerPort: 80
     ---
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Service
     metadata:
       name: hello-world
     spec:
       ports:
       - port: 80
       selector:
         app: hello-world
     ```

2. Apply the configuration with `kubectl apply -f hello-world.yaml`

## Create an ingress resource

1. Create an ingress resource. Create a YAML file called `wildcard-ingress.yaml`. Copy the following sample resource in the file and save it. Remember to edit the domain name:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
     kind: Ingress
     metadata:
       name: wildcard-ingress
       annotations:
         nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
     spec:
       rules:
       - host: "*.yourdomain.com"
         http:
           paths:
           - path: /
             pathType: Prefix
             backend:
               service:
                 name: hello-world
                 port:
                   number: 80
     ```

2. Apply the configuration with `kubectl apply -f wildcard-ingress.yaml`

## Test your setup

1. Access your application by pointing your web brower to `http://anything.yourdomain.com` (replace this with your own domain name). It should load the hello-world application.

2. Test with different subdomains, they should all lead to your `hello-world` application due to the wildcard DNS setup.

You have successfully set up an ingress controller with wildcard DNS on Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule. This setup will allow you to easily manage multiple subdomains and route traffic to the various services in your Kubernetes cluster.
