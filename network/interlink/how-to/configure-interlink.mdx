Once your InterLink has been [provisioned](/network/interlink/how-to/complete-provisioning/) by your chosen partner, a number of configuration steps become available to you. These steps must be carried out in order for traffic to successfully flow over your InterLink:

- Attach a VPC
- Create and attach an Allowed Routes list
- Activate route propagation

<Lightbox src="scaleway-interlink-config.webp" alt="A four step flow chart shows the following steps: 1. Create InterLink, 2. Attach VPC, 3. Attach allowed routes list, 4. Activate route propagation. After these steps are complete, traffic can flow across the InterLink" />

This document explains how to complete these configuration steps with the Scaleway console.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Ordered an InterLink](/network/interlink/how-to/order-interlink/) which has been [provisioned](/network/interlink/how-to/complete-provisioning/) by the partner

## How to attach a VPC

TODO macros?

Attaching an InterLink to a VPC allows you to complete the connection from your external infrastructure, across the InterLink, to the Scaleway resources in the selected VPC.

1. Click **InterLink** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. A listing of your InterLinks displays.

        TODO CHECK THIS WHOLE SECTION

2. Click on the InterLink that you want to configure. The InterLink's **Overview** page displays.

3. In the **Attached VPC** section, click **Attach VPC**. A pop-up displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-interlink-attach-vpc.webp" alt="A screen in the Scaleway console invites the user to attach a VPC to complete the connection from their external infrastructure, across the InterLink to their Scaleway resources. A dropdown menu allows a VPC to be selected. A banner reminds users to check any attached route filter lists for compatibility with the selected VPC." />
 
4. Select one of your existing VPCs from the dropdown list. It must be in the same region as the InterLink. Alternatively, click **+ Create VPC** to create and attach a new VPC.

    <Message type="tip">
    An InterLink can only be attached to one VPC at a time, but you are free to detach the VPC and attach a different one whenever you like.
    </Message>

5. Click **Attach VPC**

    The VPC is attached and you are returned to the InterLink's **Overview** page. You can change the VPC that the InterLink is attached to at any time.

To enable traffic to flow across the InterLink, you must still create and attach an Allowed Routes list, and activate route propagation.

## How to create and attach an Allowed Routes list

After attaching a VPC, the next step in configuring your InterLink is to create and attach an Allowed Routes list. 

The VPC and the external infrastructure's routers both announce their routes to each other when route propagation is activated, but all of these routes are blocked by default. Allowed Routes lists let you whitelist ranges of route announcements to allow, so that traffic can flow along these routes across the InterLink.

See the dedicated documentation on [creating and attaching an Allowed Routes list](/network/interlink/how-to/create-allowed-routes-list/) for a step by step guide.

## How to activate route propagation

Once you have attached a VPC and attached an Allowed Routes list, you can activate route propagation. This is the final step in configuring your InterLink so that traffic can flow between the VPC and your external infrastructure: it triggers the dynamic exchange of route information between the VPC and external infrastructure.

1. Click **InterLink** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. A listing of your InterLinks displays.

2. Click on the InterLink that you want to configure. The InterLink's **Overview** page displays.

3. In the **Route propagation** section, use the toggle <Icon name="toggle" /> to turn route propagation **ON**.  

    A pop-up displays, showing the attached Allowed Routes list which will define the incoming and outgoing route announcements to accept. You can change the attached Allowed Routes list if you wish. 
    
    It is not possible to activate route propagation without attaching an Allowed Routes list, as all route announcements would be blocked, rendering the action ineffective.

4. Click **Activate route propagation**.

    Route propagation is activated, and you are returned to your InterLink's overview page. 
    
    While route propagation remains active, traffic can flow across the routes allowed over the InterLink. The VPC and external infrastructure will dynamically exchange and update route information. You can deactivate route propagation at any time: if you do so, all routes are blocked and no traffic can flow.

## How to modify your InterLink configuration

You can modify the following aspects of your InterLink configuration at any time:

- The attached Scaleway VPC
- The attached Allowed Routes list
- Whether route propagation is on or off

<Message type="tip">
It is not possible to modify settings that were defined at the time of creating the InterLink, such as its region, partner, location, or bandwidth. To modify any of those settings, you must delete the InterLink and create a new one.

### How to change the attached VPC

1. Click **InterLink** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. A listing of your InterLinks displays.

2. Click on the InterLink that you want to configure. The InterLink's **Overview** page displays.

3. In the **Attached VPC** section, click the unlink icon <Icon name="unlink" /> next to the VPC you want to detach.

    A pop-up displays, confirming that this action will detach the VPC, and the InterLink will not be connected to any Scaleway resources until you reattach a VPC.

    <Message type="tip">
    If route propagation was activated, it will be automatically deactivated when you detach the VPC.
    </Message>

4. Click **Detach VPC**

    The VPC is detached, and you are returned to the InterLink's **Overview** page. No traffic can currently flow over the InterLink, and all associated routes are removed from the VPC's route table.

    Follow the next steps to attach another VPC.

5. In the **Attached VPC** section, click **Attach VPC**. A pop-up displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-interlink-attach-vpc.webp" alt="A screen in the Scaleway console invites the user to attach a VPC to complete the connection from their external infrastructure, across the InterLink to their Scaleway resources. A dropdown menu allows a VPC to be selected. A banner reminds users to check any attached route filter lists for compatibility with the selected VPC." />
 
4. Select one of your existing VPCs from the dropdown list. It must be in the same region as the InterLink. Alternatively, click **+ Create VPC** to create and attach a new VPC.

    <Message type="tip">
    Ensure that the Allowed Routes list that is attached to the InterLink is suitable for the VPC you are attaching. Remember that the outgoing routes in the list should correspond to the route announcements to whitelist from the VPC itself.
    </Message>

5. Click **Attach VPC**

    The VPC is attached and you are returned to the InterLink's **Overview** page. Remember to check the Allowed routes list and activate route propagation so that traffic can flow across the InterLink.
