```
</Message>

With ownCloud you can sync & share your files, calendar, contacts and more.
Access your data from all your devices, on an open platform you can extend and modify.

There are four steps to deploy the ownCloud application

- Deploying ownCloud
- Configuring ownCloud
- Login and Start Using ownCloud
- Configuring ownCloud with Object Storage

## Deploying ownCloud

1. Click **Create instance** button in the **Compute** section of the control panel.

2. You land on the instance-creation page where you can choose the ownCloud image in the **InstantApp** section for your Cloud Instance:
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-nc-owncloud.png" alt="" />

  The Virtual Instance will be created with a ready to use ownCloud.

3. Click **Create instance** on the right bottom of the instance creation page which will launch your instance

## Configuring ownCloud

When your instance is running, you can see the instance's IP address in the instance list on the control panel. Copy this IP address and paste it in a browser.

You land on the ownCloud configuration page.

1. Fill the admin account with your username and password.
   ownCloud uses a MySQL database. To retrieve the database credentials, connect your instance using a terminal `ssh root@<your_instance_ip>`.<br />

  The MySQL password is shown in the MOTD message that is shown upon your first connection to the instance:
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-owncloud-database.png" alt="" />

2. In the ownCloud setup, enter the database user and password you retrieve from the MOTD

3. Set the database name to `owncloud`

4. Click the **Finish Setup** button.

## Login and Start Using ownCloud

ownCloud is now installed and ready to use.

## Configuring ownCloud with Object Storage

1. Click the **Storage** button in the Scaleway control panel.

2. Click **Create a Bucket** to create a bucket for ownCloud to store files inside.

3. Name your bucket and validate your bucket creation (a bucket name must contain only alphanumeric and lowercase characters.)

4. Click the **Credentials** button.

5. Click your identifier in the top right corner and then on **Settings**.

6. Enter the **Storage** section and click **Enable external Storage**.

7. Choose **Amazon S3** in the Dropdown list and enter your S3 credentials.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-owncloud-configure-s3.png" alt="" />

    - Folder name
    - Region: `nl-ams`
    - Access Key: your `access key`
    - Secret Key: your `secret_key`
    - Bucket: The name of the bucket you created
    - Hostname: `s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud`

<Message type="important">

Edit the **Region** and **Hostname** parameters to the region of your bucket. It can either be `fr-par` (Paris, France), `nl-ams` (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) or `pl-waw` (Warsaw, Poland).

</Message>

You now have a new folder using Object Storage that allows you to have an highly available and unlimited storage.
