Scaleway Object Storage allows you to access your objects via HTTPS.

If an object is [private](/storage/object/how-to/manage-object-visibility/), you can create a temporary public link from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).

If an object is public, you can retreive the link to access it from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - [Created an Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/) and have [uploaded objects](storage/object/how-to/upload-files-into-a-bucket) to it

1. Click **Object Storage** on the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the bucket that contains the file you want to access. A list of your objects displays.
3. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the file you want to access.
4. Select **Get public link**.
5. Set an expiration date.
6. Click **Generate link**. Your temporary public link displays.

<Message type="note">
  To make the link to an object permanent, [change its visibility](/storage/object/how-to/manage-object-visibility/) to **public**. The link will work as long as the object is public.
</Message>
