You can delete your InterLink at any time. Action is required on both the Scaleway side and the partner side to completely deprovision the InterLink. Follow the steps below.

## How to delete an InterLink

1. Click **InterLink** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. A listing of your InterLinks displays.

2. Click on the InterLink that you want to DELETE. The InterLink's **Overview** page displays.

3. [Deactivate route propagation](/network/interlink/how-to/configure-interlink/#how-to-deactivate-route-propagation).

4. In the **Delete InterLink** panel, click **Delete InterLink**. 

        A pop-up displays, confirming that this action will permanently delete your InterLink on the Scaleway side.

5. Type **DELETE** in the box, and click **Delete InterLink**.

        You are returned to the InterLink's **Overview** page, where it's status now shows as **Deprovisioning**. Scaleway stops billing you for your InterLink at this point, and it can no longer be configured, un-deleted, or used to route traffic.

6. Contact your partner to request that they delete the InterLink resource on their side. They may continue to bill you until you do so, and they deprovision the resource on their side. To get in touch with the partner, you can use the same contact information that you used when [requesting the InterLink from the partner](/network/interlink/how-to/complete-provisioning/).

<Message type="note">
If the provisioning of your InterLink by the partner was never completed, e.g. you a) never contacted the partner to request provisioning of the InterLink, or b) the partner refused to provision your InterLink, you do not need to contact the partner again to request that they deprovision the resource. Deleting it on the Scaleway side is sufficient. 
</Message>

When the InterLink is fully deprovisioned on both sides, it will be deleted from the list of your InterLinks, and its Overview page will no longer be accessible.
