This page shows how to create [credentials](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#credentials) for Scaleway **NATS**, **Queues** and **Topics and Events** (previously grouped together as the **Messaging and Queuing** product). Credentials give their bearer (e.g. services and platforms) access to your service. 

You can create multiple sets of credentials for each of your NATS accounts, Queues and Topics and Events services.

## How to create credentials for a NATS account

Credentials for NATS accounts are not granular: they necessarily give full read and write access. The bearer of these credentials can publish and receive messages, as well as manage topics and streams, for this account.

1. Click **NATS** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. 

2. Use the drop-down menu to select the [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) of the NATS account for which you want to create credentials.

3. Click **NATS**. The list of your NATS accounts in the pre-selected region displays.

4. Click the NATS account you want to generate credentials for. The account's **Overview** page displays.

5. In the **Credentials** panel, click **Generate credentials**. A pop-up displays.

6. Enter a name for these credentials, and click **Generate credentials**.

    The credentials are created and a button displays prompting you to download them in a `.creds` file. 
    
    <Message type="important">
      The generated credentials are displayed only once. Make sure to download and safely store them before closing the window.
    </Message>

7. Click **Download** and save the file, before closing the window.

    You are returned to your NATs account's overview page. The name of your newly-generated credentials and their access level is displayed in the **Credentials** panel.
