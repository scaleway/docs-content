A staging site mirrors your production site, containing identical data and files while remaining publicly inaccessible.
Changes made on the staging site are isolated until deliberately transferred to the production site. Operating in the same environment, it serves as an ideal testing ground.

Previously, setting up a staging site involved a convoluted and time-intensive process of data export, database creation, file copying, and configuration adjustment, followed by a reverse procedure for deployment.
This complexity dissuaded many WordPress users from using staging sites, favoring live edits instead. However, for WordPress sites hosted on [Scaleway Web Hosting](https://www.scaleway.com/en/web-hosting/), powered by cPanel servers, the setup is simplified to just a few clicks.

Creating a staging site for your WordPress website is a smart move, allowing you to test changes before making them live. Use cases for staging sites include:
* Testing new landing pages.
* Developing or modifying themes.
* Implementing code changes to enhance functionality.
* Evaluating updates for compatibility issues.

## Creating a WordPress staging site
1. Click **Web Hosting** in the **Managed Services** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Web Hosting** overview page displays.
2. Click <Icon name="seeMore" /> or the Web Hosting domain name you want to configure. The **Hosting information** page displays.
3. Click **Control panel dashboard** to open the cPanel interface in a new tab.
4. Log in to your cPanel account and navigate to the **Domains** section. Click **WP Toolkit** to display the WP Toolkit dashboard.

5. From the WP Toolkit dashboard, locate the site you want to work with and click on it to access detailed options.
6. find and click on the Clone tool within the detailed view. The clone interface displays.

7. Designate the subdomain and path for your staging site in the clone interface.

 You can either use an existing domain or let WP Toolkit create a new one for you. Additionally, you can customize the database name if needed.

8. You can add labels to distinguish staging sites from live ones. Click **Add Label** and choose an appropriate label from the drop-down menu. (This step is optional but recommended.)
 <Lightbox src="scaleway-cpanel-wp-label.webp" alt="" size="medium" />

Once the cloning process is complete, your staging site will be ready. You can access it through the main WP Toolkit interface alongside your other sites.
Use your staging site to test changes, such as new features, themes, or code edits. Ensure everything works as expected before proceeding.

## Deploying changes to production
After testing, it's time to push the changes to your main site.

1. Go to the staging site's WP Toolkit dashboard and click the **Copy Data** tool.
 <Lightbox src="scaleway-cpanel-wp-copy.webp" alt="" size="medium" />
2. select your production site from the drop-down menu in the Copy Data interface.
3. Choose which aspects of the site to transfer, including files, database, and specific tables.
4. Choose whether to overwrite or delete production files affected by changes made on the staging site.
5. Click **Start** to proceed with the copying process.
<Message type="tip">
 WP Toolkit automatically creates a restore point before copying data, providing a safety net if anything goes wrong during deployment.
</Message>

#### Conclusion
With WP Toolkit's clone and copy features, setting up a staging site and deploying changes becomes quick and straightforward. You can create a staging site in seconds and quickly push tested changes to your production site.
This streamlined process ensures faster, safer, and more reliable WordPress workflows, crucial for agencies and businesses managing multiple WordPress sites.
