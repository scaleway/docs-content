Yahoo now enforces stricter security and authentication standards for senders.

To ensure that your emails are successfully delivered, you must register your sending domain with Yahoo Sender Portal.

You must log in with a Yahoo account (or create one) on the website https://senders.yahooinc.com/ and add the domain there.

A code will be generated that looks like this (provided as an example, do not use it):

<Message type="note">
  **Here is an example of a code:** ```yahoo-verification-key=SknBkUiLwZ+qWdbCMOrp6FwRiV4bMZXXXXXXXXXXX```
</Message>

You will then receive the code to enter in your DNS settings.

You can refer to other documentation on how to add DNS to your domain/web hosting.

If you have any doubts about the DNS settings, please open a ticket and send us the code.
