## Getting started

### Where can I find my Organization ID?
You can find your Organization ID in the [Settings](https://console.scaleway.com/settings/organization/information) page of your Organization.

You can also click the **Copy ID** button next to the Organization name to do so.

### Can I move a Project to another account?
At this time, it is not possible to move a Project from one account to another.

## Access and security

### My account is locked. What should I do?
If your account is locked, [contact our Support team](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create) to find out why it was locked and how to regain access.

### I cannot access my account, but I am still being billed. How do I resolve this?
First, you must contact the Support team to help you [unlock your account](/account/troubleshooting/cannot-log-into-my-account/). Once you have regained access, identify what resources are still running and delete them. You can also [close your account](/account/how-to/close-account), and have all your remaining resources automatically shut down.

### I received a message saying that you have detected unusual activity on my account. What should I do?
This type of error requires manual intervention from our agents. Contact our Support team via a ticket, informing us of the message you received, and requesting details about the lock and how to solve the problem.

### How can I report spam content that I received?
You can report spam easily by installing the Signal Spam plugin, which is available for web browsers, email clients, and iOS devices. The plugin, represented by an owl-shaped button, allows you to flag unwanted emails or malicious URLs (such as phishing or scams) directly from your inbox.

When you report spam, your information is processed in real-time and shared with authorized entities that can take appropriate actions, such as identifying spammers, enforcing legal measures, and blacklisting harmful URLs. While Signal Spam does not filter emails or act as an antivirus, your reports help improve security measures and contribute to a safer online environment.

To get started, install the [plugin](https://www.signal-spam.fr/en/nos-modules/) (available for Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera browsers and Mac Mail, Outlook, and Thunderbird mail clients) or follow the official reporting path at [Signal Spam](https://www.signal-spam.fr/en/parcours-signalant/) for further support.

### I don't seem to have access to my Organization's resources. What should I do?
If you do not have access to certain Organization resources, you might not have the necessary [IAM](/iam/concepts/#iam) **permission set**.

[Read the documentation on permission sets](/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/) to learn more about the different access levels.

Contact an Organization Owner or a Member with the necessary permissions to request rights to the resources you need to access.

## Quotas and limitations

### How can I get more quotas?
You can get more quotas by adding and verifying your [payment method](/billing/how-to/add-payment-method/) and [identity](/account/how-to/verify-identity/).

If you have already completed these two steps and still need an increase in quotas, contact our [Support team](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create) and inform them which product you need more quotas for.

## Account management

### Can I change my Organization's country?
If you need to change your Organization's country and region, you must [create a support ticket](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create).

To make the process faster, when creating your ticket, inform us of your Organization's new address, including: street address, city, postal code, region, and country.

### Can I change the name of my Organization?

It may take a few minutes for the new name to be fully updated across the console.

### Can I reopen a closed account?
Yes, you can [reopen a closed account](/account/how-to/close-account/#how-to-reopen-your-account). However, a closed account's resources are permanently deleted, and you cannot retrieve them.

2. Under the section **User information**, click **Edit profile**.
3. Enter a new address under **Email address**, then click **Confirm changes** to save your modification.
4. Confirm your new email address by clicking the link sent to your inbox.

### Can I transfer my Organization to another Owner?
There is no process for transferring an Organization between accounts. You can, however, change the email address of your Owner account to another Member's email address. They can then process to update their password and start using the Owner account as their own.

### I have created a resource in the wrong Project. Can I move it?
At this moment, it is not possible to move a resource from one Project to another.
If you need to move a resource, you must delete it and create it again in the right Project.

## Privacy

### I would like to delete my personal data

<Message type="note">
  Once you request the deletion of your account and personal data, you will no longer be able to access your account or invoices. The request will take at least 72 hours to be processed.
