Secondary DNS allows you to have your domain's zone file automatically backed up on a second set of name servers. This backup is a read-only copy of the zone file, containing the DNS records.

This how-to assumes that you want to manage your domains exclusively with BIND. It shows you how to configure your Dedibox as your primary DNS and nssec.online.net as your secondary DNS.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net) 
  - You have a Dedibox server,
  - Ports 53/TCP and 53/UDP are open on your server, enabling it to respond to DNS requests
  - You own a domain name, which is configured on your server with a valid SOA
</Message>

## How to configure BIND

1. If you use a management panel for your server, add the domain in your panel.
2. Log in to your server as root [via SSH](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/connect-to-server/#how-to-connect-via-ssh).
3. Use your favorite text editor to edit the general BIND configuration file, located at `/etc/bind/named.conf`. The configuration of your domain should be as follows (replace `domain.fr` with your domain):
    ```
    zone "domain.fr" { 
      type master; 
      notify yes; 
      allow-transfer { 62.210.16.8; }; 
      file "/etc/bind/domain.fr.db"; 
    }; 
    ```
4. Edit the file pointed to in the configuration carried out at step 3. In this example, you can see that the content of the zone is located in the file `/etc/bind/domain.fr.db`. Use your favorite text editor to edit the file as follows:
    ```
    $TTL 86400
    @       IN      SOA     sd-xxxx.dedibox.fr. root.domain.fr. (
                            2006081720
                            8H
                            2H
                            4W
                            1D )
            IN      NS      sd-xxxx.dedibox.fr.
            IN      NS      nssec.online.net.
            IN      MX      10 mail.domain.fr.

    domain.fr.    A       195.154.xx.xx
    ns             IN      A       62.210.xx.xx
    mail           IN      A       62.210.xx.xx
    www            CNAME   domain.fr.
    ftp            CNAME   domain.fr.
    ```

    Ensure that you do the following:
      - Replace `domain.fr` with your own domain name.
      - Replace `sd-xxxx.dedibox.fr` with the name of your Dedibox.
      - Replace `62.210.xx.xx` with the IP of your Dedibox.
      - Pay special attention to keep the “.” as they are indicated.
      - Update the serial number (here `2006081720`) using the format `YearMonthDateNumber`
5. Restart BIND for the changes to take effect:
    ```
    /etc/init.d/bind9 reload
    ```

## How to declare the domain name

1. From the [console](https://console.online.net/), click **Server** in the top menu, and select **Server List**.
2. Click **Manage** next to the relevant server.
3. Click **Secondary DNS** on the left side menu. The **Create a new entry** form displays.
4. Enter your domain name, and next to **IP** select your primary DNS server.
5. Click **Create**.
    <Message type="note">
      The initial installation of a new domain name takes about 24 hours (restart of the server each night at 2:45 CET), then updates are made according to the “refresh” indicated in the SOA of the primary DNS of your domain.

## How to test your domain

[AFNIC](https://www.afnic.fr/) is the association tasked with managing the domain name registry in France. Before you carry out your test:
  - Wait 24 hours after finishing the configuration steps above
  - Remember to create a postmaster mailbox (postmaster@domain.fr) for your domain.

1. Use a zonecheck service such as this one: [http://zonecheck.francedns.com/fr/](http://zonecheck.francedns.com/fr/):
    - In **zone**, enter your domain without www or http
    - In **primaire**, enter the reverse (sd-xxxx.dedibox.fr) of your server and its IP
    - In **secondaire** enter nssec.online.net and 62.210.16.8 as the IP
2. Click **Vérifier!**
    - If the test generates errors, correct the problems identified in the error messages
    - If the test result is `SUCCÈS`, this means everything is working. You can update the DNS servers of your domain at your registrar.

## How to deal with a failed zone transfer

If the transfer of your zone does not work, it may be that:
  - Your DNS server does not accept requests of the type AXFR
  - You forgot to update the serial of your zone (`YearMonthDayNumber`)

To test the transfer of your zone, authorize the transfer to your personal IP (allow-transfer) and test the transfer from your personal IP, using the following command:

```
dig @ip_of_my_dedibox mydomain.tld axfr
```

The serial of your zone **must** be up-to-date (2010112402 for example for the 2nd modification on 24/11/2010).
