## Problem

My container consumes an excessive amount of memory (RAM).

## Possible cause
	
With [Sandbox v2](/serverless-containers/reference-content/containers-sandbox/), the memory usage of a container is proportional to the number of forked subprocesses.

## Solutions

If your application relies on multiple subprocesses that instantiate numerous objects, (such as large modules imports in Python) we recommend using [Sandbox v1](/serverless-containers/reference-content/containers-sandbox/).

Refer to the [My container runs out of memory (OOM)](/serverless-containers/troubleshooting/container-oom/) for other solutions for memory issues.
