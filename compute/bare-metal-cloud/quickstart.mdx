Scaleway [Bare Metal servers](/compute/bare-metal-cloud/concepts/#bare-metal-server) are dedicated physical servers that you can order on-demand, like Instances. You can install an OS or other [image](/compute/bare-metal-cloud/concepts/#image) on your Bare Metal server and connect to it via SSH to use it as you require. You can power off the server when you are not using or, delete it from your account once you have finished with it. Bare Metal servers are ideal for large workloads, big data, and applications that require increased security and dedicated resources.
