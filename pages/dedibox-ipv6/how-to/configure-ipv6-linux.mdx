- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- A [Dedibox dedicated server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/)
- [Requested](/dedibox-ipv6/how-to/request-prefix/) a /48 IPv6 prefix

<Message type="note">
  Follow the IPv6 on Ubuntu configuration if you are on Ubuntu and use Netplan as your default network manager.
  Follow the IPv6 on Linux configuration with systemd-networkd if you are on another Linux distribution or prefer to use directly systemd-networkd on Ubuntu.
  Follow the IPv6 on Linux configuration with dhcpcd if your Linux distribution uses ifupdown.

## How to configure IPv6 on Ubuntu

Ubuntu uses [netplan](https://netplan.io) since the release of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS as network configuration tool.
It replaces the classical network configuration with new configuration files, written in [YAML](https://yaml.org) format, and located in the `/etc/netplan` directory. For more information regarding netplan, refer to the official [documentation](https://netplan.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

1. Open the default configuration file `/etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml` in a text editor, and edit it as follows:
    ```yaml
    # This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
    # For more information, see netplan(5).
    network:
    version: 2
    renderer: networkd
    ethernets:
        enp1s0:
        dhcp4: no
        dhcp6: no
        addresses:
        - "aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd/24" # The main IP address of your Dedibox server
        - "2001:bc8:xxxx:xxx::x/64" # An IP address from your IPv6 block and its subnet mask /64, replace placeholder values
        gateway4: aaa.bbb.ccc.1 # The gateway is the IPv4 address of your Dedibox, ending on .1
        nameservers:
        addresses: [ "51.159.47.28", "51.159.47.26" ] # Replace the IP of the DNS cache server with the one located in the same physical location as your machine for optimal performances (https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/account/reference-content/scaleway-network-information/#dns-cache-servers)
        routes:
        - to: 0.0.0.0
            via: aaa.bbb.ccc.1
            on-link: true
    ```

    Remember to replace `enp1s0` with the proper name of your internet interface.

    <Message type="note">
      The configuration example above is valid for the main IP address of your Dedibox server. If you want to use IPv6 on a [virtual machine](/dedibox-network/how-to/configure-network-netplan/#configuring-a-failover-ip-for-virtual-machines), remember to use the unique gateway for the failover IPv4.

2. Check and validate your configuration file.
    ```
    sudo netplan –debug
    ```
3. Activate the new configuration:
    ```
    sudo netplan apply
    ```

## How to configure IPv6 on Linux with systemd-networkd

`systemd-networkd` is the network manager of [systemd](https://systemd.io/). It is provided natively on most Linux distributions and can be used for the configuration of IPv6 with its DHCPv6 client feature.

<Message type="tip">
  When specifying the IP address of your Dedibox, you need to enter it in [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing). The netmask for the main IPv4 of a Dedibox server is `/24`, the netmask for a failover IPv4 is `/32`. The netmask for the IPv6 is `/64`.

1. Run the `ip link show` command to find the name of your public internet interface. Make sure to store it, as it will be required in the next steps.
2. Run the following command to create a backup of the current network configuration and configure `systemd-networkd`:
    ```
    sudo mv /etc/systemd/network/eno1.network /etc/systemd/network/eno1.network.bkp
    ```
3. Run the following command to enable `systemd-networkd`.
    ```
    systemctl enable systemd-networkd.service
    ```
4. Create a new file called `<interface_name>.network` and open it in a text editor.
    ```
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/network/eno1.network
    ```
5. Open the file in a text editor and paste the following content. Make sure to replace the values in the example with your own and save them before exiting the text editor.
    ```
    [Match]
    #The name must correspond to your interface name
    Name=eno1

    [Network]
    DHCP=ipv6
    IPv6AcceptRA=yes
    # IPv4 of the Dedibox, change netmask to /32 if failover IPv4
    Address=<ipv4_of_your_dedibox>/24
    # IPv6 of the Dedibox
    Address=2001:bc8:xxxx:xxx::x/64

    [Route]
    # The IPv4 gateway is either your Dedibox IP ending on .1 (i.e. x.y.z.1) for the physical host or 62.210.0.1 for any VM running on a Dedibox
    Gateway=<gateway_ipv4>
    GatewayOnlink=yes

    [DHCP]
    ClientIdentifier=duid-only
    DUIDType=link-layer
    # Scaleway Dedibox DUID without the DUID-LL "00:03" at the beginning
    DUIDRawData=<Scaleway IPv6 DUID>

    [DHCPv6]
    UseAddress=no
    WithoutRA=solicit

    [IPv6AcceptRA]
    DHCPv6Client=always
    UseOnLinkPrefix=False
    UseAutonomousPrefix=False
    ```
10. Run the following command to activate the new configuration.
    ```
    systemctl start systemd-networkd
    ```

## How to configure IPv6 on Linux with dhcpcd

This expands the tutorial on [dhcpcd](/tutorials/dhcpcd-dedibox/).

On certain Linux distributions like Debian Trixie, you may find `dhcpcd` alongside `ifup` (`dhcpcd-base` must be installed).

If your server supports SLAAC, you must enable it in your dashboard. If it is not provided for your Dedibox, you can skip to the dhcpcd configuration.
Then make sure the interface and firewall allows IPv6 routing advertisements.

For instance, if your interface is named `eno1`, as root, you can set it using:

```
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/eno1/accept_ra
```

Then configure `dhcpcd`.

You must first copy DUID into  `/var/lib/dhcpcd/duid`. This file is auto-generated the first time by `dhcpcd`.
While there is a `duid <uuid>` option in the configuration, the Scaleway one is not in the correct format, resulting in the client using the generated one.

Finally update the configuration of `/etc/dhcpcd.conf` with the following:

```
interface eno1
  # request to use dhcpv6
  dhcp6
  # request a non-temporary address
  ia_na
  # sets the "identifier" of the interface to 1
  iaid 1

# request a prefix delegation on the interface 1 but do not allocate it (-)
ia_pd 1 -
```

If you are only using the /48, you should request a prefix delegation (`ia_pd`) and allocate it to other interfaces (VMs, VPN, etc.) or just keep it blank with `-`.

On Debian, you can restart `networking` which relies on `ifup`:

```
sudo systemctl restart networking
```

Or if you use a distribution that has standalone `dhcpcd`:

```
sudo systemctl restart dhcpcd@eno1
```
