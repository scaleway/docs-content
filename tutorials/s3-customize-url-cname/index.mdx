title: S3 Object Storage - Customizing URLs with CNAME
description: This page shows how to use a customized domain name with Object Storage buckets
excerpt: |
  Depending on the services you provide you might not want that the scw.cloud domain name appears on your website.
  For example if you provide files to download or host the images of your website on Object Storage. In this case you might prefer a domain name like download.mywebsite.com instead of providing links like download.mywebsite.com.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud.
  By using CNAME you can map a domain or subdomain to an Object Storage bucket and access the files stored in the bucket via your own domain name.

## Custom domain name with CNAME

Depending on the services you provide you might not want that the `scw.cloud` domain name appears on your website.
For example if you provide files to download or host the images of your website on Object Storage. In this case you might prefer a domain name like `download.mywebsite.com` instead of providing links like `download.mywebsite.com.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud`.

By using CNAME you can map a domain or subdomain to an Object Storage bucket and access the files stored in the bucket via your own domain name.

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have an Object Storage bucket with activated [bucket website](/storage/object/how-to/use-bucket-website/) feature
- You have access to the DNS zone of your domain name

## Configuring a custom Domain name

1. To use a customized domain name with a bucket, connect to your management console, enter the **Object Storage** section and create a new bucket.

2. It is important that the bucket name is exactly the same as the domain/subdomain intended to be used with it. For example, to create a bucket, accessible at `download.example.com` the bucket name must be `download.example.com`.

3. Set the bucket ACL with [AWS-CLI](/storage/object/api-cli/object-storage-aws-cli/):
  ```
  aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket download.example.com --acl public-read
  ```

4. Log into the administration panel of your domain and create a new record that defines the hostname as an alias for the bucket. For example if the bucket `download.example.com` is located in the Paris Region, the CNAME should point to `download.example.com.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud`:
<Lightbox src="scaleway-bucket_cname.png" alt="" />

5. It is now possible to access a the file `myapp.tar.gz` stored in the bucket `download.example.com` directly at `http://download.example.com/myapp.tar.gz` instead of the usual URL `http://download.example.com.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/myapp.tar.gz`.

  Please note that SSL is not available when using this way to connect to a bucket.
