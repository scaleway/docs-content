Route rules allow you to specify, for a given frontend, which of its backends it should direct traffic to depending on the requested host. For [HTTP](#protocol) frontends/backends, route rules are based on HTTP Host headers. For [TCP](#protocol) frontends/backends, they are based on **S**erver **N**ame **I**dentification (SNI). You can configure multiple route rules on a single frontend.

## How to create route rules

1. Click **Load Balancers** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. 

2. Click the Load Balancer you want to create a route rule for.

3. Click the frontend you want to create a route rule on.

4. Click the **Route Rules** tab.

5. Click <Icon name="plus" /> **Create a route rule** to create a new route rule.

6. Enter the following information to configure the route rule:
    - **Source frontend**: The current frontend is pre-set.
    - **Target backend**: Select the backend to which the frontend should direct traffic to for this rule.

    If you have selected an HTTP frontend/backend pair:

    - **HTTP Host header**: Enter an HTTP Host header value to filter for (for example `www.example-domain.com`). Traffic with a matching value in its HTTP Host header will be directed to the specified target backend.

    If you have selected a TCP frontend/backend pair:

    - **SNI value**: Enter an SNI value to filter for (for example `www.example-domain.com`). Traffic with a matching SNI value will be directed to the specified target backend.

7. Click **Create a route rule** to finish.

  Your route rule is created, and you are taken to the list of all your route rules for this Load Balancer.

  You can repeat this process to create as many route rules as you want.

## How to edit route rules

1. Click **Load Balancers** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu.

6. Edit the backend and/or SNI/HTTP Host header value as required.

7. Click **Edit route rule** to finish. 

  Your route rule is edited and you are returned to the list of route rules.

## How to delete route rules

1. Click **Load Balancers** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. 

2. Click the Load Balancer you want to delete route rules for.

3. Click the frontend you want to delete route rules on.
