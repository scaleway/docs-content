- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created a [Block Storage volume](/storage/block/how-to/create-a-volume/)

<Message type="important">
  - You must detach your volume from the Instance it is attached to before deleting the volume. Refer to our documentation to find out [how to do so](/storage/block/how-to/detach-a-volume/).
  - We highly recommend that you [unmount](/storage/block/api-cli/unmounting-a-volume/) your volume from the operating system before detaching it, to avoid data loss.

1. Click **Block Storage** in the **Storage** section of the Scaleway console side menu. A list of your volumes displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Delete** next to the volume of your choice. A pop-up displays.
3. Type `DELETE` to confirm.
4. Click **Delete volume**.
    <Message type="important">
      This action permanently deletes your volume and all the data it contains. If you do not want to lose this data, make a backup before deleting the volume.
