## Retrieving content using a Kubo client

Once your content is pinned on our service, you can retrieve it via any other [Kubo client](/labs/ipfs-pinning/api-cli/ipfs-cli/), compatible with Linux, Mac, and Windows.

1. Run the following CLI command to initialize your local IPFS node:

    ```
      ipfs init
    ```

2. Run the following CLI command to launch the IPFS background process, effectively turning your device into a functioning node in the IPFS network:

    ```
    ipfs daemon
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
        If you wish to use the same terminal for future commands, you need to run `ipfs daemon &`. This will run the daemon in the background and return control to the terminal.
    </Message>

3. Run the following command to fetch your content using its CID and store it in a file. Make sure to replace the example values with your own: 

    ```
    ipfs get <YOUR_PINNED_CID> > myFile
    ```
    <Message type="note">
        Your content will be stored in a file called `myFile`.
    </Message>

## Retrieving content using an HTTP gateway

There are different ways to access data over the HTTP or HTTPS protocols. You can either use a web browser or the [curl](https://curl.se/) command.

Paste the following link into your web browser to retrieve public content via an IPFS gateway. Make sure to replace the example value with your own:

```
https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<YOUR_PINNED_CID>
```

Alternatively, run the following `curl` command to retrieve it via a local client. Also make sure to replace the example value with your own:

```
curl https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<YOUR_PINNED_CID>
```

## Retrieving content using a Go client

You can also retrieve pinned content via the Go program. To do so, we recommend using the official [go-ipfs-api package](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-api).

In this case, you need to run an IPFS node (like Kubo) to perform operations with the IPFS network.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "os"


  ipfs "github.com/ipfs-pinning/go-ipfs-pinning-api"
)


func main() {
	// Where your local node is running on localhost:5001
	sh := ipfs.NewShell("localhost:5001")
	err := sh.Get("<YOUR_PINNED_CID>", "myFile")
	if err != nil {
          fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "error: %s", err)
          os.Exit(1)
	}
}
```
