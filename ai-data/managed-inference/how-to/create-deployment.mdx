- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)

    - Choose the geographical **region** for the deployment.
    - Specify the GPU Instance type to be used with your deployment.
4. Enter a **name** for the deployment, and optional tags.
5. Configure the **network** settings for the deployment:
    - Enable **Private Network** for secure communication and restricted availability within Private Networks. Choose an existing Private Network from the drop-down list, or create a new one.
    - Enable **Public Network** to access resources via the public internet. Token protection is enabled by default.
    <Message type="important">
      - Enabling both private and public networks will result in two distinct endpoints (public and private) for your deployment.
