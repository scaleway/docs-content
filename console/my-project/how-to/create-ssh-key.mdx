[SSH keys](/console/my-account/concepts#ssh-key) allow you to securely connect to your compute instances without using a password. An SSH key consists of an [RSA key pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)), which has two elements:

- An **identification key** (aka private key), which you must keep securely on the computer you want to connect from.
- A **public key** which you must upload to the Scaleway interface. This is then transferred to your compute instance during the boot process.

You can create the SSH key pair on your local machine. The process will depend on your operating system.

## How to create an SSH key pair on OSX and Linux

On OSX and Linux, you can create the SSH key pair directly from the terminal (command line).

1. Open the terminal application by clicking on the corresponding icon.

2. Type `ssh-keygen -o -b 4096` and press `Enter` to generate a new key.
  <Message type="important">

  For security reasons you must generate a 2048-bit or 4096-bit RSA key (hence the `-b 4096` part of the command). Older 1024-bit keys are no longer supported. The `-o` option was added in 2014, to specify use of the new OpenSSH format. If the command fails for you, try removing the `-o`.

3. Enter a filepath to save the key to when prompted. Alternatively, press **Enter** to leave this at the default setting (the key will be saved in a file called `id_rsa` in the `/Users/me/.ssh` directory).
  ```
  Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/me/.ssh/id_rsa):`
  ```

4. Enter a passphrase when prompted. This step is not mandatory, but is recommended for increased security. The passphrase can be freely chosen. If you do not want to set a passphrase, press **Enter** directly.
  ```
  Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
  ```

5. Enter the passphrase again for confirmation when prompted, and press **Enter**:
  ```
  Enter same passphrase again:
  ```

  The key pair is generated in the filepath you specified. The key pair consists of:
    - The public key, named `id\_rsa.pub`
    - The private (identification) key, named `id\_rsa`

6. Display the content of the public key with the following command and copy it.
  ```
  cat /Users/me/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  ```

7. Copy the content of the public key which is displayed. You will need this in the next step. Your key should look something like the output shown:
  ```
  ssh-rsa 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 me@localhost

## How to create an SSH key pair on Windows

On Windows, you can use the third-party application [PuTTYgen](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) to create an SSH key pair.

1. Download and install [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) to your local computer. The **PuTTYgen** application is automatically installed (as well as the main PuTTY application).
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-puttygen-app.png" alt=""/>

2. Launch PuTTYgen by double-clicking on the application icon. The following screen displays.
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-puttygen-screen1.png" alt="" />

3. Select **RSA**, set the number of bits in the key to **4096** and click the **Generate** button:
4. Move the mouse around the blank area as instructed, to generate randomness.
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-puttygen-randomness.gif" alt="" />

  The public and private keys are generated and the following screen displays:
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-puttygen-screen2.png" alt="" />

5. Complete the steps on the screen to finish:

- Fill in the **Key-comment** field with a name to help you identify this key pair
- Click the **Save public key** button and save it in the folder of your choice
- Click the **Save private key** button and save it the same folder
- Select the content of the public key (the sequence of characters under "Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file"). Copy it, as you will need this in the next step.

## How to upload the public SSH key to the Scaleway interface

You must upload the content of the public part of the SSH key pair you just created to the Scaleway interface. This is then transferred to your compute instance during the boot process. You can then connect and authenticate from your local machine (where the private key is) to the remote compute instance (where the public key is).

1. From the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com), navigate to the [Credentials](/console/my-project/concepts#credentials) tab of your Project Dashboard:
  <Lightbox src="credentials-nav.png" alt="" />
  
2. Scroll down to the **SSH Key** section, and click **Add a new SSH key**.
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-ssh-keys.png" alt="" />

3. Paste the content of the public key (which you copied in the previous step) into the pop-up box, and optionally add a description. Then click **Add a SSH key**.

You will now be able to [connect to your instances via SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/)

<Message type="tip">

  If you have any difficulties after uploading a new public SSH key, try the following:  
 
  - If you cannot connect to your instance at all via SSH, reboot your instance from the console and try again.
  - If you can connect to your instance using a previously uploaded SSH key but not the new one, reload your SSH keys with the `scw-fetch-ssh-keys --upgrade` [command](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/blob/master/docs/commands/account.md)
