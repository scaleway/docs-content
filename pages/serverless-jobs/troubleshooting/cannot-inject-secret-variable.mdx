## Problem

My environment variables and secrets are not properly injected during my job runs.

## Cause

Environment variables or secrets that are too large, contain carriage returns and spread over several lines, as shown below, will not be injected properly.

```
"hello
world
.
"
```

### Solution 

To avoid issues while injecting environment variables and secrets, we recommend encoding them to `base64`.
