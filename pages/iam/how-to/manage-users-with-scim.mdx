**S**ystem for **C**ross-domain **I**dentity **M**anagement (SCIM) is a standard protocol for exchanging user identity and authorization data between an Identity Provider (IdP) and a Service Provider.

Combined with [SAML](/iam/how-to/set-up-identity-federation), it allows IAM managers to fully manage user authentication, lifecycle, and personal data through their Identity Provider:
- SAML is used for members to log in, by authenticating on their Identity Provider with the IdP-defined authentication policies 
- SCIM is used to automatically create, update, lock, unlock, and delete Scaleway users based on actions performed on the user directory of the Identity Provider

<Message type="important">
  Only SCIM user-related actions are currently supported by Scaleway. Group auto-provisioning is planned to be available in the coming months.
</Message>

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to enable SCIM

1. Click the **Settings** button in the upper-right corner of the Organization Dashboard. The [Organization Settings](https://console.scaleway.com/settings) page displays.
  Alternatively, click the avatar icon on the upper-right corner of the header navigation, and select **Settings** on the drop-down menu.
2. Click **Automatic user provisioning (SCIM)**, under **Organization security**, on the left navigation menu. The SCIM section displays.
3. Click the **Enable** button. A pop-up displays to inform you that a token creation is required to enable SCIM.

2. Click the **Enable SCIM and create token** button. SCIM is now enabled for the Organization and two fields must be copied:
- **A SCIM token**, to be used by the Identity Provider to authenticate to Scaleway to perform the needed actions. This token is **sensitive** and should not be shared to anyone. It will only be displayed once by the console.
- **A base URL**, for the Identity Provider to know where to connect to Scaleway.

3. Click on **Close**. The configuration is complete on Scaleway side, but you need now to configure SCIM on your Identity provider. 

Both base URL and SCIM token need to be communicated to your Identity Provider using their SCIM configuration interface. Make sure both fields are used during the configuration as any provider will need both to provision users on Scaleway. Depending on the provider, you may benefit from a test interface to make sure that the configuration is correct.

<Message type="note">
      To ensure the correct configuration of SCIM, you can perform an action on your Identity Provider (changing a name, creating a new user). You should then see:
      - The impacts reflected on [your users](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users)
      - The update events appearing on your [Audit Trail in the Paris region](https://console.scaleway.com/audit-trail/fr-par/events)
    </Message>

<Message type="important">
      By default, SCIM will only manage users with a common username between the Identity Provider and Scaleway. The federation will **compare users from Identity Provider and from Scaleway on the username**, and all users who do not exist on the Identity provider sid, will not be impacted by the SCIM configuration.

      If these users must be managed through SCIM, they must be re-created on the Identity Provider side, or settings must be changed on the Identity Provider side.
    </Message>

Depending on the providers, the delay between a change on Identity Provider side and the reflected impact on Scaleway will vary from a few seconds to 30 minutes. This duration cannot be edited on Scaleway side.


## How to rotate the SCIM token

At any moment, your SCIM configuration can have up to two active tokens. When your token is about to expire, from the SCIM Configuration section, you can create a second token.

1. Click on **Generate token** to create a second token
2. Follow the same steps as during the [first SCIM activation](/iam/how-to/manage-users-with-scim/#how-to-activate-scim) - don't forget to replace the former SCIM token by the new one on your Identity provider
3. Make sure the SCIM configuration is still working
4. Optionally, you can delete the previous token

<Message type="note">
      SCIM tokens have a time-to-live of 1 year. When a token is expired, it cannot be used to provision users, and a new token must be created to keep SCIM synchronization working.
    </Message>

## How to deactivate SCIM

1. Click the **Disable** button on top of the Automatic user provisioning (SCIM) section
2. Type **Disable** to confirm.
    <Message type="important">
      - If automatic user provisioning with SCIM is disabled on Scaleway, your Identity Provider will not be able to perform any actions on Users, even if the configuration is correctly done on this side.
