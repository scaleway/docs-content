Credentials give their bearer (e.g. services and platforms) access to your service. 

This page shows how to manage [credentials](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#credentials) for Scaleway **NATS**, **Queues** and **Topics and Events** (previously grouped together as the **Messaging and Queuing** product). 

Credentials for **Queues** and **Topics and Events** can be updated to change their permissions, or revoked. **NATS** credentials can only be revoked, not updated. Once credentials are revoked, any user trying to use the credentials to connect to the service will be denied.
