The Scaleway [Serverless Functions platform](https://www.scaleway.com/en/serverless-functions/) makes your functions available, executes them on demand and manages resource allocation for you. A function is a lightweight unit of logic, that defines a procedure for changing one element into another. The function remains static, while the variables that pass through it can vary. We show you how to create a functions namespace, create your function, and delete it when you no longer need it.

<Message type="tip">
  This page explains how to deploy functions using Scaleway Console. For advanced usage (ex: larger projects with dependencies, automation, multiple functions...) [several ways to deploy functions](/serverless/functions/reference-content/deploy-function/) are available.

  For real-world examples check out our [scaleway/serverless-examples repository](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-examples).

## How to create a functions namespace

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.
2. Click **Create namespace**. The functions namespace creation wizard displays.
3. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 
    - Enter a **name** and optionally a **description** for your namespace. The first character of your namespace must be a letter. It can only contain letters, numbers, and dashes. No other special characters are permitted. The namespace is case-sensitive and cannot be edited after its creation.
    - Choose a **region**, which is the geographical location in which your namespace will be deployed.
    - (Optionally) Enter any **environment variables** required for your namespace. Environment variables configured in a namespace will be available in all functions/apps within the same namespace. For each environment variable, click **+ Add new variable** and enter the key/value pair.
4. Click **Create namespace** to finish.
    
    Your namespace is now created and you are taken to its **Functions** tab.

## How to create a function

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.
2. Click the functions namespace you want to use to create your function.
3. Click **Create function**. The function creation wizard displays.
4. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 
    - Enter your **function code**. 
      - Set the handler for your function.
      - Choose your desired runtime and its version.
      - Choose to either use the inline code editor to edit your code directly from your browser in the box provided, or to upload a `*.zip` archive.
    - Choose a **name** for your function, and optionally a **description**. The name must only contain alphanumeric characters.
    - Choose the **resources** to be allocated to your function at runtime. These define the performance characteristics of your function.
    - Set your **scaling** preferences, or leave them at default values. The Scaleway platform autoscales the number of available instances of your function to match the incoming load, depending on the settings you define here.
    - Define any **environment variables** you want to inject into your function. For each environment variable, click **+Add** and enter the key/value pair.
    - Set secret environment variables (optional). **Secrets** are environment variables which are injected into your function and stored securely, but not displayed in the console after initial validation. Add a **key** and a **value**.
    - Set the desired **privacy policy** for your function. This defines whether a function can be executed anonymously (**public**) or only via an authentication mechanism provided by the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-functions/#authentication) (**private**).
    - Click **Advanced Options** if you wish to set a custom timeout for your function.

        [Triggers](/serverless/functions/concepts/#trigger) can no longer be added from this screen. For more information, refer to the [How to add a trigger to a function](/serverless/functions/how-to/add-trigger-to-a-function/) documentation.
      </Message>
    - Verify the **estimated cost**.
5. Click **Create function** to start the function deployment process.
  <Message type="note">
    During the deployment process your function will be executed in a Scaleway environment, if a dependency is missing or
    there are errors in the code you can check for function logs.

## How to delete a function

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.
2. Click the relevant functions namespace.
3. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the function you want to delete, and select **Delete** from the dropdown menu.
4. Type **DELETE** in the pop-up that asks you to confirm the action, then click **Delete function**.
    <Message type="tip">
      You can also delete a function from the [Function settings tab](/serverless/functions/how-to/manage-a-functions-namespace/).
