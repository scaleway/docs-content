When you [create a Scaleway account](/console/account/how-to/create-an-account), an Organization is automatically created, of which you are the [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner). If you are invited to someone else's Organization, you will simultaneously be the Owner of your own Organization and a guest in the other Organization, where you will have the rights and permissions granted to you via [policies](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#policy).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- Received an invitation to join an [Organization](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#organization)

When someone invites you to join their Organization, you receive an email to inform you.

<Message type="important">
  If the Organization you were invited to [enforces MFA](/console/account/how-to/enforce-mfa), make sure you have [activated MFA](/console/account/how-to/use-2fa) before accepting the invitation.
</Message>

## If you already have a Scaleway account

1. Click **Log in to your account** from your email invitation. The Scaleway console opens in a browser window.
2. Log into the Scaleway console using your credentials. Your Organization overview page displays.
    <Message type="note">
      If you are already logged in, skip to the next step.
    </Message>
3. Click **Accept** in the top right pop-up.

    <Message type="important">
      If you click **Decline**, your invitation will be rescinded. If you want to be invited again, you must ask the [IAM Manager](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/permission-sets) or [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) of the Organization.
    </Message>

    You are redirected to the overview page of the Organization to which you were invited.

    As an [IAM user](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#user) of an Organization, you must always ensure that you are in the desired Organization by checking the Organization name that displays in the top right corner of your console.

    In the image below, we are currently in the Marion Créange Organization (highlighted in red). Use the drop-down menu to navigate to a different Organization, for example below we could switch to the Documentation Team Organization.

2. Create a Scaleway account. Follow the [How to create a Scaleway account](/console/account/how-to/create-an-account) documentation page to do so. Your Organization overview page displays.
3. Click **Accept** in the top right pop-up.
