[Mastodon](https://www.joinmastodon.org/) is an open-source, self-hosted, social media and social networking service. It allows the hosting of your own Instances which may have their own code of conduct, terms of service and moderation policies. There is no central server and Mastodon Instances are connected as a federated social network, allowing users from different Instances to interact with each other. The platform provides privacy features allowing users to adjust the privacy settings of each of their posts.

As there is no central server, may choose to join or leave an instance according to its policy without actually leaving Mastodon Social Network. Mastodon is a part of [Fediverse](https://fediverse.party/), allowing users to interact with users on other platforms that support the same protocol for example: [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/en/), [Friendica](https://friendi.ca/) and [GNU Social](https://gnu.io/social/).

Mastodon provides the possibility to use [S3 compatible Object Storage](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/) to store media content uploaded to Instances, making it flexible and scalable.

</Message>

## Installing Prework

1. [Connect to your instance](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/) via SSH.

2. Update the APT packet cache and the software already installed on the instance.

  ```
  apt update && apt upgrade -y
  ```

3. Make sure `curl` is installed on the system and add an external repository for the required version of Node.js, install it by running the following commands:

  ```
  apt install curl -y
  curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | bash -
  ```

4. Mastodon uses the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) package manager. Install the repository for the required version of Yarn by running the following commands:

  ```
  curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | apt-key add -
  echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
  apt update
  ```

5. Mastodon depends on various other packages, which have to be installed before the installation of the software:

    - [Imagemagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/) for image related operations
    - [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) for conversion of GIFs to MP4s
    - [Protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) with `libprotobuf-dev` and `protobuf-compiler`, used for language detection
    - [Nginx](https://nginx.org/) as frontend web server
    - [Redis](https://redis.io/) for its in-memory data structure store
    - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is used as SQL database for Mastodon
    - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is used for Mastodon's streaming API
    - [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) is a Node.js package manager
    - [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) is a tool to manage TLS certificated issued by the [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) nonprofit "Certificate Authority" (CA)

  As well as some other `-dev` packages and `g++` - These packages are required for the compilation of Ruby using ruby-build.

  Install them via the apt package manager:

  ```
  apt install -y imagemagick ffmpeg libpq-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev file git-core g++ libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler pkg-config nodejs gcc autoconf bison build-essential libssl-dev libyaml-dev libreadline6-dev zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libffi-dev libgdbm6 libgdbm-dev nginx redis-server redis-tools postgresql postgresql-contrib certbot python3-certbot-nginx yarn libidn11-dev libicu-dev libjemalloc-dev
  ```

6. We are going to use `rbenv` to manage Ruby versions. The application must be installed for a single Linux user, therefore, first we must create a user under which Mastodon will run. The `--disabled-login` flag disables direct login to the user account for increased security:

  ```
  adduser --disabled-login mastodon
  ```

7. Then log into the `mastodon` user account and enter into the home directory of the user:

  ```
  su mastodon
  cd
  ```

8. Setup [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build):

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
  cd ~/.rbenv && src/configure && make -C src
  echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
  echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
  # Restart the users shell
  exec bash
  # Check if rbenv is correctly installed
  type rbenv
  # Install ruby-build as a rbenv plugin
  git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
  ```

9. Install and enable the [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) version that is used by Mastodon. This step may last some time:

  ```
  RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS=--with-jemalloc rbenv install 2.6.6
  rbenv global 2.6.6
  ```

10. Finally install `bundler` by running the following command:

  ```
  gem install bundler --no-document
  ```

Once this is done, you can switch back into the root account by typing `exit`.

## Configuring PostgreSQL

Mastodon requires access to a postgreSQL database to store its configuration and user data.

1. Change into the `postgres` user account, run `psql` and create a database:

  ```
  sudo -u postgres psql
  ```

2. In the PostgreSQL prompt create the database user for Mastodon and exit from it afterwards:

  ```
  CREATE USER mastodon CREATEDB;
  \q
  ```

## Downloading Mastodon

1. Switch into the `mastodon` user account:

  ```
  su - mastodon
  ```

2. Enter the users home directory and clone the Mastodon Git repository into the directory `live`:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon.git live && cd live
  ```

3. Checkout to the latest stable branch

  ```
  git checkout $(git tag -l | grep -v 'rc[0-9]*$' | sort -V | tail -n 1)
  ```

4. Continue by installing the remaining Ruby dependencies:

  ```
  bundle config deployment 'true'
  bundle config without 'development test'
  bundle install -j$(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN)
  ```

5.  Use yarn to install the node.js dependencies:

  ```
  yarn install --pure-lockfile
  ```

6. Exit back to the root account by typing `exit`.

## Requesting a Let's Encrypt Certificate

1. Stop Nginx before requesting the certificate:

  ```
  systemctl stop nginx
  ```

2. Request a certificate by using `certbot` with TLS SNI validation in standalone mode. Replace `example.com` with your domain name:

  ```
  certbot certonly --standalone -d example.com
  ```

3. As Let's Encrypt have a validity of 90 days, a cron-job can be used to renew them and to restart nginx automatically. Create a new file and open it in a text editor like nano:

  ```
  nano /etc/cron.daily/letsencrypt-renew
  ```

4. Copy the following content into the file, save it and exit nano:

  ```
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  certbot renew
  systemctl reload nginx
  ```

5. Allow execution of the script and restart the cron daemon. It will run the script daily:

  ```
  chmod +x /etc/cron.daily/letsencrypt-renew
  systemctl restart cron
  ```

## Configuring Nginx

1. Copy the example configuration file shipped with Mastodon in your Nginx `sites-available` directory and create a symlink to it in the `sites-enabled` directory:

  ```
  cp /home/mastodon/live/dist/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/mastodon
  ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/mastodon /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/mastodon
  ```

2. Open the configuration file in a text editor, for example nano:

  ```
  nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/mastodon
  ```

3. Replace `example.com` in the configuration file with your domain or subdomain. Replace it also with your domain in all following occurences.

  ```
  map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
    default upgrade;
    ''      close;
  }

  upstream backend {
      server 127.0.0.1:3000 fail_timeout=0;
  }

Save the file by pressing on `CTRL+O`, then exit nano by pressing on `CTRL+X`.

## Configuring the Mastodon Application

1. Enter the `mastodon` user account:

  ```
  su - mastodon
  ```

2. Change into the **/home/mastodon/live** directory and run the Mastodon installer:

  ```
  cd /home/mastodon/live
  RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake mastodon:setup
  ```

  The interactive installer guides through the setup process.

  When asked enter the domain name or subdomain of the instance.
  When asked to use Docker choose **No**. Most of the other values are already pre-filled with the correct settings. Edit them if required for your setup.

  To set up Mastodon with Object Storage choose **Amazon S3** as service provider and enter the following information for the account. Valid [API Key](/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key/) are required for the configuration with Object Storage.

  When asked, enter the details as following:

  ```
  Provider Amazon S3
  S3 bucket name: [scaleway_bucket_name]
  S3 region: fr-par
  S3 hostname: s3.fr-par.scw.cloud
  S3 access key: [scaleway_access_key]
  S3 secret key: [scaleway_secret_key]
  ```

  <Message type="note">

    If your bucket is located in Amsterdam, use `nl-ams` as region and `s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud` as S3 hostname If it is located in Warsaw, use `pl-waw` and `s3.pl-waw.scw.cloud`.

  </Message>

  Once the configuration is complete, the installer will start to compile the application. This may take some time and consume a lot of RAM.

3. Once the application is installed, you will be asked if you want to create an Administrator account for your Mastodon instance. Type `Y` to create the account. Enter the username for the admin user, followed by your email address. A random password will be generated. Take a note of it, as you will require it to connect to your instance.

  ```
  All done! You can now power on the Mastodon server 🐘

  Do you want to create an admin user straight away? Yes
  Username: admin  <-- Enter the username for your Mastodon admin account
  E-mail: me@myemail.com <-- Enter your email address
  You can login with the password: 9dc4d92d93a26e9b6c021bb75b4a3ce2
  ```

4. Type `exit` to switch back into the root account.

## Setting-up systemd Services

Systemd scripts are used to manage services on Ubuntu systems. Three different scripts are required for Mastodon. These scripts come with the Mastodon package, you need to copy them to their final destination, then activate the services.

1. Copy the Mastodon `systemd` scripts into their final destination:

  ```
  cp /home/mastodon/live/dist/mastodon-*.service /etc/systemd/system/
  ```

2. Reload the systemd daemon:

  ```
  systemctl daemon-reload
  ```

3. Start the services and enable them, so they will start automatically upon the next system reboot:

  ```
  systemctl start mastodon-web mastodon-sidekiq mastodon-streaming
  systemctl enable mastodon-web mastodon-sidekiq mastodon-streaming
  ```

4. Verify if all services are running:

  ```
  systemctl status mastodon-*.service
  ```

If everything is running, open a web browser and go to your domain name. You will see the home page of your Mastodon instance:

<Lightbox src="scaleway-mastodon_home_new.png" alt="" />

You can log in with the admin account that you have created during the installation to configure additional parameters of your instance, link the instance with another one to join a federated network, create another user account and start sharing posts and photos on your timeline. If configured with Object Storage, all files uploaded to the instance are automatically stored in the Object Storage bucket and embedded in the users timeline:

<Lightbox src="scaleway-mastodon_feed.png" alt="" />

For more information and advanced configuration of Mastodon, refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/tootsuite/documentation#running-mastodon).
