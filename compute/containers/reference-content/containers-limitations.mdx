## Configuration Restrictions

In order to ensure the proper functioning of the product, we restrict the use of certain ports and environment variables

* Blocked Port:
  * **25**: Due to potential abuse (SPAM), no outbound traffic is allowed through this port

* Reserved environment variables:
  * `PORT`: Port on which your server should listen to: `8080`
  * `SCW_*`: Reserved for product configuration (for example: token validation)
