Once enabled, the versioning feature supports the retrieval of objects that are deleted or overwritten. It is a way to keep multiple variants of an object in the same bucket.

If the feature is enabled, you can list archived versions of an object or permanently delete an archived version.

<Message type="note">
  If you enable versioning, you will have several object versions. Each version of an object stored in your bucket takes up disk space and is billed.
