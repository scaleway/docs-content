Credentials give their bearer (e.g. services and platforms) access to your service. 

This page shows how to manage [credentials](/topics-and-events/concepts/#credentials) for Scaleway Topics and Events. Credentials can be updated to change their permissions, or revoked. Once credentials are revoked, any user trying to use the credentials to connect to the service will be denied.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Valid [credentials](/topics-and-events/how-to/create-credentials/)
