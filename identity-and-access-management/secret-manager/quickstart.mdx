## How to create a folder and a secret

<Message type="note">
  If you have no resources yet in Secret Manager, you can create a folder during secret creation.
</Message>

1. Click **Secret Manager** in the **Security and Identity** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu.
2. Click **+ Create secret**.
3. Choose the [region](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#region) in which you want to store your folder and your secret.
    <Message type="important">
     Folders and secrets cannot be moved from one region to another after creation.
    </Message>
4. Select **Create a new path** and enter `/`, followed by a name for your [folder](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#folder).
    <Message type="important">
      A [path](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#path) is the directory structure to access your folders and secrets. Each path **must be prefixed** with a slash.
    </Message>
5. Enter a name for your secret and add tags (optional).
6. Add your secret manually or import it from a file.
    <Message type="note">
     The maximum file size for your secret is 64 KiB.
    </Message>
7. Optionally, click <Icon name="toggle" /> to enable [secret protection](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#secret-protection).
8. Optionally, click <Icon name="toggle" /> next to **Single access** or **Time to Live** to apply an [ephemeral policy](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#ephemeral-policy) to your secret and its versions.
    <Message type="important">
      - **Single access**: allows you to set your secret versions to **expire after one single access**.
      - **Time to Live**: allows you to set a time frame of up to one year, during which your secret versions are valid and accessible.
      - The ephemeral policy can only be applied to a secret at creation, and **cannot be removed** once applied.
      - Once applied to a secret, the ephemeral policy's settings will be applied to all the secret's versions (even those created subsequently).
    </Message>
9. Click **Create secret**. The **Overview** tab of your secret displays.
    <Message type="note">
      - You have created a folder and a secret on the go, located in the `/` path of the selected region.
      - The value of your secret is stored in its first version, which is enabled by default. At creation, your secret only has one version. Keep reading our quickstart to find out how to add more versions to your secret.
    </Message>

10. Click **Back to Secrets** to display your folder and its contents.

    <Message type="tip">
      - Read our [documentation](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/how-to/create-folder/) to learn how to create more folders once you have created resources in Secret Manager.
      - Read our [documentation](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/api-cli/migrate-secrets-in-folders/) to find out how to migrate secrets located in the `/` path, to specific folders.
    </Message>
