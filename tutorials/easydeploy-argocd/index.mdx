Grafana is a powerful open-source platform for monitoring and observability, allowing users to visualize and analyze metrics from various data sources.
It provides interactive dashboards, alerts, and custom reports, making it invaluable for tracking system performance, diagnosing issues, and gaining insights into complex environments.
Grafana's flexibility and ease of use make it a popular choice for managing applications and infrastructure.

<Macro id="requirements" />
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
- Created a Scaleway Kubernetes [Kapsule](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/) or [Kosmos](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-kosmos-cluster/) cluster

## Deploying the Grafana application using Easy Deploy

1. In the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/), navigate to the **Kubernetes** section under **Containers**.
2. Click the name of the cluster where you wish to deploy Grafana. The **Cluster Information** tab will display.
3. Click the **Easy Deploy** tab. The application dashboard displays.
4. Click **Deploy Application**. The application deployment wizard displays.
5. Choose **Application Library** to see the list of available applications.
6. Select the **Grafana** application.
    <Message type="tip">
        If you cannot find Grafana on the first page, use the search bar or navigate through the library using the arrow buttons.
    </Message>
7. Optionally, customize the default configuration for Grafana using [Helm Charts](/tutorials/kubernetes-package-management-helm/). If you do not require any customized configuration you can skip this
8. Enter a name and a Kubernetes namespace for your application. If no name is entered, Grafana will be installed in the default namespace of the cluster.
9. Click **Deploy Application** to deploy Grafana on your Kubernetes cluster.

## Retrieving the Grafana admin password

1. Access the [Kubernetes Dashboard](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/access-kubernetes-dashboard/) of your cluster and navigate to **Secrets** under the **Config and Storage** section.
2. Select the name of your Grafana application to display its data.
3. Click the "eye" icon next to **admin-password** to reveal the Grafana admin password. Copy the password.

## Connecting to Grafana

Grafana uses a LoadBalancer to manage traffic. To check the deployment status, run:

```
$ kubectl get svc
NAME                               TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)        AGE
application-silly-sammet-grafana   LoadBalancer   10.34.223.177   51.159.xxx.yy   80:32483/TCP   35s
kubernetes                         ClusterIP      10.32.0.1       <none>          443/TCP        4h58m
```

Once the external IP status changes from `<PENDING>` to the assigned external IP, your Grafana application is up. Copy the IP address and paste it into a web browser. The Grafana login screen will appear.

## Logging into Grafana

1. Paste the external IP address of the LoadBalancer service into your web browser to open the Grafana login screen.
2. Enter **admin** as the username and the password retrieved in the previous step as the password to log in.
