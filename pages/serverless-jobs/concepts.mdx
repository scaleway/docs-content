## Commands and arguments

Field `command` is deprecated in favor of `startup_command` in `v1alpha2`.

For more details see [startup command and arguments](/serverless-jobs/concepts/#startup-commands-and-arguments) and [v1alpha2 migration guide](/serverless-jobs/reference-content/v1alpha1-to-v1alpha2/).

## Container Registry

Container Registry is the place where your images are stored before being deployed. We recommend using Scaleway Container Registry for optimal integration. See the [migration guide](/serverless-jobs/api-cli/migrate-external-image-to-scaleway-registry/) for full details.

## Environment variables

An environment variable is a variable whose value is set outside the program, typically through functionality built into the operating system. An environment variable is made up of a name/value pair, and any number may be created and available for reference at a point in time.

## Ephemeral storage

In addition to CPU and RAM, Serverless Jobs also provide a storage volume for the duration of the task. This storage space allows to hold the data retrieved by the job, and disappears once the execution is complete.

## GB-s

Unit used to measure the resource consumption of a container. It reflects the amount of memory consumed over time.

## Job

Serverless Jobs is a fully managed solution that enables you to plan, schedule, queue and run batch processing workloads without worrying about provisioning and scaling. A job is a single instance of one of these batch processing workloads.

## Job definition

A Job definition is a template for a Serverless Job. It contains all the information necessary to run the job, including the container image used, the resources allocated, and the command to execute. The definition acts as a blueprint for [job runs](#job-run).

## Job name

The name of a job is part of the [job definition](#job-definition) and is used for informational purposes only.

## Job run

A job run is the execution of a job definition. It can be in a running, succeeded, canceled, or failed status. Each job run has a unique identifier and can be individually monitored using [Cockpit](/cockpit/quickstart/).

## Logging

Serverless offers a built-in logging system based on Scaleway Cockpit to track the activity of your resources: see [monitoring Serverless Jobs](/serverless-jobs/how-to/monitor-job/).

## Maximum duration

The maximum duration option allows you to define the maximum execution time before your job is automatically killed.

## Metrics

Performance metrics for your Serverless resources are natively available: see [monitoring Serverless Jobs](/serverless-jobs/how-to/monitor-job/).

## Private Networks compatibility

Refer to the [dedicated FAQ](/serverless-jobs/faq/#how-can-i-configure-access-to-a-private-network-or-virtual-private-cloud-vpc) for more information on Serverless Jobs compatibility with Private Networks and [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](/vpc/).

## Schedule (cron)

A schedule (cron) is a mechanism used to automatically start a Serverless Job at a specific time on a recurring schedule. It works similarly to a traditional Linux cron job, using the `* * * * *` format. Refer to our [cron schedules reference](/serverless-jobs/reference-content/cron-schedules/) for more information.

## Secrets reference

A secret reference is a mechanism that allows you to use a secret stored in [Secret Manager](/secret-manager/) within Serverless Jobs. It allows you to securely reference sensitive data, such as API secret keys, passwords, tokens, or certificates.

## Startup commands and arguments

Serverless Jobs allows you to customize the `startup_command` and `args` instructions to override default image instructions.

<Message type="note">
  * `command` field is deprecated prior `startup_command`.
  * If `startup_command` is already filled then the `command` instruction is ignored.
  * `startup_command` and `args` can interpret environment variables, allowing for easier automations.
</Message>

- The `startup_command` instruction defines the command, process, or script executed when your job starts. It overrides the `ENTRYPOINT` of the image.
- The `args` instruction defines the arguments passed to the `startup_command` instruction. Arguments can be passed as environment variables, as shown in the example below.

**Example**

```yaml
env:
- name: MESSAGE
  value: "hello world"
startup_command: ["/bin/echo"]
args: ["$(MESSAGE)"]
```

Refer to the [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/) for more information on commands and arguments behavior.

## Status

A Serverless Job run can have the following statuses:
* **Running**: your Serverless Job run is currently executing.
* **Succeeded**: your Serverless Job run finished in a successful state.
* **Queued**: your Serverless Job run is waiting for resources to run.
* **Error**: your Serverless Job run finished with an error or timeout. [Check our troubleshooting documentation](/serverless-jobs/troubleshooting/job-in-error-state/) to solve the issue.
* **Canceled**: your Serverless Job run has been canceled by the user.

## Stateless

Refers to a system or application that does not maintain any persistent state between executions. In a stateless environment, each request or operation is independent, and no information is retained from previous interactions.

This means that each request is treated as a new and isolated event, and there is no need for the system to remember previous states or data once a task is completed. Statelessness is commonly used in serverless architectures where each function execution is independent of others.

To store data you can use [Scaleway Object Storage](/object-storage/), [Scaleway Managed Databases](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/), and [Scaleway Serverless Databases](/serverless-sql-databases/).

## Terraform/OpenTofu

Terraform is an infrastructure-as-code tool developed by HashiCorp, while OpenTofu is an open-source fork of Terraform. Serverless Jobs integrate easily with your infrastructure as code, via our [Terraform/OpenTofu provider and resources](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/scaleway/scaleway/latest/docs/resources/job_definition).

Examples using Terraform/OpenTofu can be found in our [Serverless Examples repository](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-examples), such as our [example using Terraform/OpenTofu with Serverless Jobs](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-examples/blob/main/jobs/terraform-hello-world).

## vCPU-s

Unit used to measure the resource consumption of a container. It reflects the amount of vCPU used over time.
