You can enable or disable your IoT Hub from the Scaleway console. This can be useful if you want to do maintenance actions on your hub, or if you want to change the [product plan](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/change-plan) of your hub.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created an IoT Hub](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/create-hub)
</Message>

1. Click **IoT Hub** in the **IoT Station** section of the side menu. The list of your IoT Hubs displays.
2. Click the name of the IoT Hub you want to disable or enable. The hub's overview page displays. 
3. Toggle the **Enabled**/**Disabled** switch to change the status of your Hub.

4. Confirm the status change by clicking **Diable Hub** or **Enable Hub** in the pop-up window.
    <Message type="important">
      As long as a Hub is disabled it will not be billed, but its devices won't be able to connect.
