## How to delete a regional Private Network

1. Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the side menu.

    A default VPC for each available region has been automatically created for you. Currently VPC is only available for the **France - Paris** region.

2. Click the **Default VPC** for the `PAR` region.

    A list of your regional Private Networks in this VPC displays.

3. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the regional Private Network you want to delete, then click **Delete** on the pop-up menu.

    A screen displays asking you to confirm that you want to delete the network, and that you have detached all resources from it.

4. Type **DELETE** and click **Delete regional Private Network**.

  Your regional Private Network is deleted.
