You can manage and edit the parameters of your cluster from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) or by using the [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/). Here, we show you how to edit from the console.

<Requirements />

- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
