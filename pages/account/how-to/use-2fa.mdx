You can enable multifactor authentication on your Scaleway account for heightened security. Once enabled, an additional security code generated by your phone is required to access your account.

Multifactor authentication provides extra layers of security. In addition to your password (the first factor), other factors (such as an MFA app) are required to access your account. Even in the event of a leaked password, your account is protected.

## How to download an MFA app

To use [multifactor authentication](/account/concepts/#multifactor-authentication-mfa) on your account, you first need to download an MFA app onto your smartphone. Once configured, MFA apps display a constantly rotating set of codes to use with your different accounts when you are prompted for one during login. Popular MFA apps include:
- [Authy](https://authy.com/download/)
- [FreeOTP](https://freeotp.github.io/)
- [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en&gl=US)

Download the app of your choice and install it onto your smartphone.

## How to enable MFA

1. Click your Organization name on the top-right corner of the console navigation menu, click **Profile**, then **Security**.
    <Message type="important">
      If you are logged in as an [IAM Member](/iam/concepts/#member), Click **Profile**, then **Credentials** and scroll down to the **Multifactor authentication** section.
    </Message>
2. Click **Enable MFA**, in the **Multifactor authentication** section. A pop-up displays.
3. Enter the code shown on the pop-up into your MFA app, or scan the QR code into your app.
  Your app sets up MFA for your Scaleway account and displays a 6-digit code.
4. Enter the 6-digit authentication code given by your app into the pop-up box, then click **Submit**. A pop-up displays.
5. Download or copy the backup codes shown, and save them in a safe place. These codes will be the only way to regain access to your account without your MFA app.

MFA is now enabled on your account.

Next time you log in to your Scaleway account, you will be prompted for an MFA code. Use your MFA app to get the code and enter it in the Scaleway console.

## How to update MFA

If you no longer have access to the device in which you set up your MFA, you can update your MFA information and set it up via the Scaleway console.

## How to disable MFA

<Message type="important">
  You cannot disable MFA if you are a Member of one or more Organizations where MFA is enforced. If you wish to disable MFA, you must first leave these Organizations. If you do not know which of your Organizations enforce MFA, follow the procedure below until step 2. The Organizations will be listed in the **Disable MFA** pop-up.

  Alternatively, click your Organization name on the top-right corner of the console navigation menu, click **Profile**, then **Security**.

3. Type **DISABLE** in the box to confirm, then click **Disable**.

MFA is now disabled on your account.

## How to regain access to your account

### If you lose your MFA device

If you lose your authentication device, you can regain access to your account using the backup codes that were generated when you enabled MFA.

When you log into your account, you are prompted for an MFA code.

Enter one of your **backup codes** instead of a code generated by your MFA device in real-time, then click **Log in**. You are logged into your account and can [disable MFA](#how-to-disable-mfa) if you wish.

### If you lose your MFA device and backup codes

If you lose both your MFA app and backup codes, the only way to regain access to your account is through a manual identity verification.

To do so, make a request to our Trust and Safety team. You must make your request from the e-mail address registered on your account. In your email, provide the following information:

- The telephone number registered on your account
- If you have an individual account, your passport or local ID card
- If you have a corporate account, the certificate of incorporation and a copy of the last Scaleway invoice you received

Submit the complete set of required documents via email to `document@scaleway.com`.

After analyzing your documents, our team will deactivate your two-factor authentication (2FA).
