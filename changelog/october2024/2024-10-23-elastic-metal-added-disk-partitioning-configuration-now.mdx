You can now partition the disk capacity of your server as needed during server setup by directly editing the JSON file in the Scaleway console. Eligible servers are marked with the green 'NEW' badge. 
Refer to the [dedicated page](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/configure-disk-partitions/) for more details on custom partitioning.
