Scaleway is a complete cloud ecosystem, offering a single way for you to create, deploy and scale your infrastructure in the cloud. Creating your Scaleway account gives you access to the [Scaleway console](/console/account/concepts/#console) and [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/), and you can deploy our products and services with ease.

## Console overview
Follow this guided tour to discover how to navigate the console.

## How to create an account

<Macro id="create-account" />

## How to create resources

Once you have validated your payment method, you can start ordering resources like Instances, Kubernetes Kapsule, Object Storage and more. Find out more about [how to add resources to your Projects](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/add-resources-project/).

## How to close an account

Every account has an associated Organization, which in turn has an Owner. When you create your account, you are designated as the Owner of the Organization associated with your account.

When you [close your account](/console/account/how-to/close-account/), you delete all its resources and backups. Any guests who have joined your Organization will lose access because your Organization will no longer exist.

<Message type="important">
  There is a delay of up to 10 days between the time your account is closed and the time the system deletes your resources. It is recommended to manually delete all your Organization's resources before closing your account. To reopen your account, [contact support](https://console.scaleway.com/support).
