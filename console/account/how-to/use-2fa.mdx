You can enable multifactor authentication on your Scaleway account for heightened security. Once enabled, an additional security code generated by your phone is required to access your account.

Multifactor authentication provides extra layers of security. In addition to your password (the first factor), other factors (such as an MFA app) are required to gain access to your account. Even in the event of a leaked password, your account is protected.

## How to download an MFA app

To use multifactor authentication on your account, you first need to download an MFA app onto your smartphone. Once configured, MFA apps display a constantly rotating set of codes to use with your different accounts when you are prompted for one during login. Popular MFA apps include:
- [Authy](https://authy.com/download/)
- [FreeOTP](https://freeotp.github.io/)
- [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en&gl=US/)

Download the app of your choice and install it onto your smartphone.

## How to enable MFA

1. Click to open the Organization drop-down menu in the top-right corner of the console, and select **My Profile**.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-org-dropdown-myprofile.webp" alt="" />
2. Scroll to the bottom of your profile page, and click **Enable MFA**. A pop-up displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-2FA-popup-1.webp" alt="" />
3. Enter the code shown on the pop-up into your MFA app, or scan the QR code into your app.
    Your app sets up MFA for your Scaleway account and displays a 6-digit code.
4. Enter the 6-digit code given by your app into the pop-up box, and click **Submit**. A pop-up displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-2FA-popup-2.webp" alt="" />
5. Download or copy the backup codes shown, and save them in a safe place. These codes will be the only way you can regain access to your account without your MFA app.

MFA is now enabled. Next time you log in to your Scaleway account, you will be prompted for an MFA code. Use your MFA app to get the code and enter it in the Scaleway console.

## How to update MFA

If you no longer have access to the device in which you set up your MFA, you can update your MFA information and set it up via the Scaleway console.

## How to disable MFA

<Message type="important">
  You cannot disable MFA if you are a member of one or more Organizations where MFA is enforced. If you wish to disable MFA, you must first leave these Organizations. If you do not know which of your Organizations enforce MFA, follow the procedure below until step 2. The Organizations will be listed in the **Disable MFA** pop-up.

3. Type **DISABLE** in the box to confirm, and click **Disable**.

## How to regain access to your account

### If you lose your MFA device

If you lose your MFA device, you can use the backup codes that were generated when you activated MFA to regain access.

When you log into your account, you are prompted for an MFA code:

<Lightbox src="scaleway-2FA-login.webp" alt="" />

Enter one of your backup codes (instead of a code generated by your MFA device in real-time) and click **Send token**. You are logged into your account, and can disable MFA if you wish by [following the instructions above](#how-to-disable-mfa).

### If you lose your MFA device and your backup codes

If you lose both your MFA device and your backup codes, it is more difficult to regain access to your account. You will need to go through a manual identity verification process.

The only way to regain access to your account is to contact our support team with the following information:
  * Email address
  * Postal address
  * Two different documents proving your identity (passport or local ID card for individual accounts + certificate of incorporation for companies)
  * A contact phone number
  * A copy of your last Scaleway invoice, or details about the amount charged if you do not have a copy
  * A card or bank statement showing your Scaleway invoice debit

Once you have collected all this information, send it to [document@scaleway.com](mailto:document@scaleway.com).
