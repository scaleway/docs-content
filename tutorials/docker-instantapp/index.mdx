Docker is an open source containerization platform. It allows developers to package their applications into containers, using OS-level virtualization. This page shows you how to create an Instance with Docker pre-installed using the Docker [InstantApp](/compute/instances/concepts/#instantapp), and then how to start using Docker for your containerization projects.

## Creating and connecting to your Docker InstantApp Instance

1. Create the Instance by [following our dedicated instructions](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/). When choosing your **Image**, click the **InstantApps** tab and select the **Docker** InstantApp.

2. [Connect to your Instance via SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).

## Building your first container

Docker allows you to ship applications in containers. Containers are standardized units of software that bundle the application's code and all its dependencies into one package, so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. This is a text document that contains all the commands a user would execute on the command line to assemble an image.

Here, we create a new Dockerfile for a small Python web application with [Flask](/tutorials/flask), that will run on the Instance:

1. Create a new directory to develop your environment.

  ```
  mkdir my-application
  ```

2. Enter into the directory.

  ```
  cd my-application
  ```

3. Create a new file, called `Dockerfile`. Copy and paste the following content into it and save the file:

  ```
  # Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
  FROM python:3.7-slim

  # Set the working directory to /app
  WORKDIR /app

  # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
  ADD . /app

  # Install the Flask framework
  RUN pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org Flask

  # Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
  EXPOSE 80

  # Define environment variable
  ENV NAME World

  # Run app.py when the container launches
  CMD ["python", "app.py"]
  ```

  The Dockerfile is now ready, and we can proceed to creating the application.

4. Open a text editor, copy paste the following content and save the file as `app.py`:

  ```py
  from flask import Flask
  import os
  import socket

  app = Flask(__name__)

  @app.route("/")
  def hello():

      html = "<h1>Hello {name}!</h1>" \
            "<b>Hostname:</b> {hostname}<br/>"
      return html.format(name=os.getenv("NAME", "world"), hostname=socket.gethostname(),)

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=80)
  ```

  The application will run a simple web server on port 80 and return the values of the environment variable `NAME` set in the Dockerfile, as well as the hostname of the container when it is running.

5. Build the image. The `-t` tag is used to set a friendly name for the image:

  ```
  docker build -t helloworld .
  ```

  Docker now downloads the Python base image and processes the tasks defined in the Dockerfile to create the image for our application:

  ```

  The image is now available in the local docker registry:

  ```
  docker image ls

  REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
  helloworld          latest              71368b10bc5c        3 minutes ago       153MB
  ```

## Running the application

Run the application with the `-p` option to map the port 4000 of your instance to port 80 of the container:

```code
docker run -p 4000:80 helloworld
```

A message displays, showing that the application called `app` is running:

```
* Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
* Environment: production
  WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.
  Use a production WSGI server instead.
* Debug mode: off
* Running on http://0.0.0.0:80/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

The message displays the information that the application is running on port `80`.

Remember, this is the internal port of the container. To reach the application, type `http://your_instances_ip:4000` in the address bar of your browser:

<Lightbox src="scaleway-docker_app_running.png" alt="" />

The application displays the internal hostname of the container and retrieves the word "World" from the environment variable that was set in the Dockerfile.

### Sharing the application

Docker makes it easy to ship images to a registry to share with others.

In this example, the public Docker registry is used ("Docker Hub"), but it also possible to set up a [private registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/) to distribute the image on your infrastructure, or to use the [Scaleway Container Registry](/docs/compute/container-registry/quickstart/).

<Message type="note">

  You need a Docker account for this part of the tutorial. If you do not have one, you can create an account at [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com).

1. Log into the Docker registry:

  ```code
  docker login
  ```

2. Tag the image, using the `docker tag` command followed by the notation `imagename username/repository:tag`. This associates your local image with a repository on the registry. The tag at the end is not mandatory, but recommended as it is the mechanism that registries use to give Docker images a version.

  ```code
  docker tag imagename username/repository:tag
  ```

3. Push your image to the Docker Hub:

  ```code
  docker push username/repository:tag
  ```

  Once the image has been pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) it will be publicly available and you can see the image with its pull command in your account.

### Pulling and running an image from a remote repository

Your image is now available on the Docker Hub, and you can run it from anywhere

```code
docker run -p 4000:80 username/repository:tag
```

If the image is not available yet on the local machine, Docker will automatically download (pull) it from the registry.

No matter on which machine you run it, it will always run in the same environment that you configured when you built the image.
