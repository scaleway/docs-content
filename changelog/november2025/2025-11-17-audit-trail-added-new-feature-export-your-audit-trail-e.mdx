The new Audit Trail export feature allows you to export all your event logs to a specified Object Storage bucket for long-term retention and analysis. The initial export configuration covers all Audit Trail events from the last 90 days and allows for one active export per region. Read [our documentation](/audit-trail/how-to/manage-adt-export/) to find out how to set up your export.
