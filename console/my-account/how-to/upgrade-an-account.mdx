When you first [create your account](/console/my-account/how-to/create-an-account), you are asked to select between three account levels:

- **Discover:** allows you to browse through the Scaleway console and discover the catalog without ordering.
- **Test:** allows you to order a few resources and test them before starting development or production.
- **Build:** allows you to order any type of resources and scale your project as it grows.

To unlock the different levels, you will need to progressively add information to your account.

## How to upgrade from Discover to Test

To upgrade your account level from **Discover** to **Test**, you need to add billing information to your account.

1. Log into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com).

2. Click **Add Billing Information** in the banner on your Organization Dashboard.

3. Add your credit card information by [following these instructions](/console/my-account/how-to/manage-billing-information#how-to-add-a-credit-card).

<Message type="tip">

After adding a credit card but **before** verifying the credit card via a magic code, you have the option to fast track your account upgrade directly from Discover to Build. This option is displayed on your organization dashboard on a **Fast Track** banner. If you wish to fast-track your upgrade, click the banner and follow the instructions for [verifying your identity](/console/my-account/how-to/verify-identity) and [verifying your credit card](/console/my-account/how-to/manage-billing-information#how-to-add-a-credit-card).

<Message type="note">

Once you have achieved Build level, you are able to add a SEPA mandate as a payment if you wish. See how to [manage your billing information](/console/my-account/how-to/manage-billing-information/) for instructions on this process.
