Overleaf is a collaborative writing and publishing system that uses LaTeX, a typesetting software that allows for creating structured, professional documents online.

It is particularly favored by academics and professionals for producing scientific documents, research papers, theses, and presentations due to its precise formatting and styling capabilities. Overleaf also supports real-time collaboration between multiple authors.

<Requirements />
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission)
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An [Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) with Docker installed and at least **30 GB of storage**
- Installed `git` on your Instance
- Properly configured DNS A/AAAA records pointing to your Instance's public IP

### Preparing the environment
1. SSH into your Instance:
    ```bash
    ssh root@<YOUR-INSTANCE-IP>
    ```
2. Ensure Docker is installed:
    - If Docker is not installed, follow the [Docker Installation Guide](/tutorials/install-docker-ubuntu-jammy-jellyfish/).
    - Verify Docker installation:
      ```bash
      docker --version
      ```

3. Create a directory for Overleaf:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p /opt/overleaf-toolkit
    cd /opt/overleaf-toolkit
    ```

4. Clone the Overleaf repository from GitHub:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit.git /opt/overleaf-toolkit
    ```

5. Initialize the configuration:
    ```bash
    cd /opt/overleaf-toolkit
    ./bin/init
    ```

6. Start the application and its containers:
    ```bash
    ./bin/up
    ```
    <Message type="note">
    If a web server is already running on port 80, stop it before running the command.
    </Message>

## Stopping the application and updating Overleaf's configuration

1. Stop the application with `CTRL+C`.
2. Edit the Overleaf configuration file:
   ```bash
   nano ./config/overleaf.rc
   ```
3. Modify the following line:
   ```bash
   OVERLEAF_PORT=80
   ```
   Change it to:
   ```bash
   OVERLEAF_PORT=8877
   ```
4. Save and exit.


## Configuring a systemd service

1. Create a systemd service file:
    ```bash
    nano /etc/systemd/system/overleaf.service
    ```
2. Add the following content:
    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=Overleaf Community Edition

    [Service]
    User=root
    WorkingDirectory=/opt/overleaf-toolkit
    ExecStart=/opt/overleaf-toolkit/bin/up
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=10

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```
3. Save and exit the editor.
4. Reload systemd:
    ```bash
    systemctl daemon-reload
    ```
5. Enable and start the service:
    ```bash
    systemctl enable overleaf.service
    systemctl start overleaf.service
    ```
6. Check the service status:
    ```bash
    systemctl status overleaf.service
    ```

## Installing LaTeX packages

1. Update the TeX Live Manager:
    ```bash
    docker exec sharelatex tlmgr update --self
    ```
2. Install the full TeX Live package:
    ```bash
    docker exec sharelatex tlmgr install scheme-full
    ```
<Message type="note">
    - Replace `sharelatex` with the name of the Share LateX container. Use `docker ps` to find it.
    - The installation of `textlive` may take a while and take up a lot of storage space. Ensure your Instance has sufficent storage available.

## Configuring SSL

1. Install Certbot and nginx
```bash
apt install python3-certbot-nginx nginx
```

2. Obtain an SSL certificate
```bash
sudo certbot --nginx certonly
```

3. Add a daily cron job for certificate renewal:
    ```bash
    crontab -e
    ```
    Add the following line to the crontab:
    ```bash
    30 4 * * * certbot renew --pre-hook "service nginx stop" --post-hook "service nginx start"
    ```

## Configuring Nginx

1. Edit the Nginx configuration:
    ```bash
    nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
    ```
2. Replace the file content with:
    ```
    server {
        listen       80;
        listen       [::]:80;

        server_name  my.overleaf-instance.tld;

        location / {
          return              301 https://$server_name$request_uri;

          proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
          proxy_read_timeout 3m;
          proxy_send_timeout 3m;

          access_log      /var/log/nginx/overleaf.access.log;
          error_log       /var/log/nginx/overleaf.error.log;
      }
    }
    ```
    <Message type="note">
      Replace `my.overleaf-instance.tld` with your Overleaf domain name in the configuration.

3. Save and restart Nginx:
    ```bash
    service nginx restart
    ```

## Creating a first admin user

1. Open your browser and navigate to `<http://<YOUR_OVERLEAF_DOMAIN>/launchpad/`. A form displays, prompting you to set up your admin account by entering an email and password. After filling in the credentials, click **Register**.

2. Follow the link to the login page (`<http://<YOUR_OVERLEAF_DOMAIN>/login>/`) and enter the credentials you just created. Upon successful login, you'll be directed to a welcome page.

To begin using Overleaf, click the green button at the bottom of the welcome page. For more information on how to use Overleaf, refer to the [official documentation](https://www.overleaf.com/learn).
