There are two ways you can close your account: by deactivating your Organization, or by definitively deleting your account and personal data. Read on to find out more and choose the method that best suits your preferences and needs.

## How to deactivate your Organization

Deactivating an Organization will permanently delete your Organization's servers, resources, services and backups. It will also deactivate the account. However, you can choose to reactivate your account at a later date if you wish, eliminating the need to recreate an account from scratch.

<Message type="note">

There is a delay of up to 10 days between the time your Organization is closed and the time your resources are effectively destroyed. It is recommended to cancel all your resources before you close your Organization. A deactivated Organization can be reactivated upon your request.

1. Open the Organization dropdown menu at the top-right corner of the Scaleway console, and click **Organization**.

3. Click the **Deactivate Organization** button once you have read and agreed with the warning message.

  The **Deactivate Organization** button will only display if you are the [Owner](/console/my-account/concepts#owner) of your [Organization](/console/my-account/concepts#organization).

4. Type **Deactivate** in the first box to confirm your decision. You can also fill out the second box with the reason you decided to close your account.

5. Click **Deactivate Organization permanently** to confirm.

## How to erase your account and personal data

Using this option will permanently delete your account. You will not be able to reactivate your Organization at a later date, and your personal data will be permanently deleted.
