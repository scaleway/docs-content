You may be unable to use your Scaleway flexible (public) IP address because it is blocked by a third-party service (e.g., Grafana, AWS, or other platforms).

## Cause

IP addresses are automatically assigned from IP pools when you create a new flexible IP. Some third-party services implement security measures that may block certain IP ranges based on historical traffic patterns, regardless of current usage.

Since flexible IPs are allocated dynamically from available pools, it's possible, though uncommon, that your assigned IP falls within a range that is restricted by a specific external service you wish to use. This is not specific to Scaleway and can occur with any cloud provider whose IP ranges have been previously exposed to abusive traffic. 

## Solution

To obtain a public IP address that is not blocked by the third-party service, you can request a new public IP and check whether it falls outside the blocked CIDR range that concerns you. You may need to repeat this process until you receive a usable IP. It is not possible to request a specific public IP.

Steps: 

1. Create a new flexible IP address for the desired product, via the Scaleway console or developer tool.
2. Check the IP of the newly assigned address.  
3. Test connectivity with the third-party service to confirm the new IP is not blocked.  

Release unused IPs once you have one for your use case.
