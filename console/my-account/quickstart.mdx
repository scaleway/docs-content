Scaleway Elements is a complete cloud ecosystem, offering a single way for you to create, deploy and scale your infrastructure in the cloud. Creating your Scaleway Elements account gives you access to the [Scaleway Console](/console/my-account/concepts/#console) and [Scaleway API](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/), and you can deploy our products and services with ease.

## How to create an account

1. Open the [Scaleway website](https://www.scaleway.com/en/elements/) in a web browser.

2. Enter your email address in the form, then click **Get started now**. Alternatively, click **Sign Up** in the upper right corner of the page. You are redirected to the sign-up page:

3. Select an account type (**Personal** or **Corporate**) and fill out your first and last name, as well as your email address.

4. Check the box and solve the [reCaptcha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReCAPTCHA) if you would like to receive marketing communications from Scaleway. Then, click **Get Started!** to create your account. A message displays to request that you check your email inbox for the verification email.

5. Click the verification link in your mailbox to confirm your email address and agree to our terms of service. You are redirected to the Scaleway Console. A welcome message displays.

    You are asked to select between three account levels:

    - **Discover:** allows you to browse through the Scaleway console and discover the catalog without ordering.
    - **Test:** allows you to order a few resources and test them before starting development or production.
    - **Build:** allows you to order any type of resources and scale your project as it grows.

    <Message type="note">
    To unlock the different levels, you will need to progressively add information to your account.

6. Select an account level and click **Get started!**.

The next steps will vary, depending on the level you chose. Follow the links relevant to your case for further instructions:

- If you chose **Discover**, you can browse the Scaleway console without needing to take any further action yet. However, you won't be able to [create resources](/console/my-project/how-to/add-resources-project/) until you add billing information.
- If you chose **Test**, you will be prompted to [add billing information](/console/my-account/how-to/manage-billing-information/) to your account. You can then [create a few resources](/console/my-project/how-to/add-resources-project/) to test out the platform.
- If you chose **Build**, you will be prompted to [add billing information](/console/my-account/how-to/manage-billing-information/) to your account, and to [verify your identity](/console/my-account/how-to/verify-identity/). You can then [create any type of resources](/console/my-project/how-to/add-resources-project/) and start building your projects.

## How to upgrade an account

### How to upgrade from Discover to Test

To upgrade your account level from **Discover** to **Test**, you need to add billing information to your account.

1. Log into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).

2. Click **Add Billing Information** in the banner on your Organization Dashboard.

3. Add your credit card information by [following these instructions](/console/my-account/how-to/manage-billing-information#how-to-add-a-credit-card).

<Message type="tip">

After adding a credit card but **before** verifying the credit card via a magic code, you have the option to fast track your account upgrade directly from Discover to Build. This option is displayed on your Organization dashboard on a **Fast Track** banner. If you wish to fast-track your upgrade, click the banner and follow the instructions for [verifying your identity](/console/my-account/how-to/verify-identity) and [verifying your credit card](/console/my-account/how-to/manage-billing-information#how-to-add-a-credit-card).

</Message>

### How to upgrade from Test to Build

To upgrade your account level from **Test** to **Build** , you need to verify your identity.

1. Log into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).

2. Click **Verify my identity** in the banner on the Organization dashboard:

3. See [how to verify your identity](/console/my-account/how-to/verify-identity/) for instructions on the rest of the process.

<Message type="note">

Once you have achieved Build level, you are able to add a SEPA mandate as a payment if you wish. [See how to manage your billing information](/console/my-account/how-to/manage-billing-information/) for instructions on this process.

## How to create resources

Now that you've created your Test or Build level account, you probably want to know how you can order resources like Instances, Kubernetes Kapsule, IoT Hubs and more. Find out more about [how to add resources to your Projects](/console/my-project/how-to/add-resources-project/).

## How to delete your account

Every account has an associated Organization, which in turn has an Owner. If you created your account (and never joined another Organization), you are the Owner of the Organization associated with your account. You can therefore use the **Deactivate Organization** to permanently delete your account and all of its services and backups.

<Message type="important">

  There is a delay of up to 10 days between the time your Organization is closed and the time resources are effectively destroyed. It is recommended to cancel all your resources before you close your Organization. A deactivated Organization can be reactivated upon your request.

</Message>

1. Click **Organization** at the top-right of the console, then click **Organization**. The **Organization Account** page displays.

2. Click **Deactivate Organization** which displays at the bottom of the page, once you have read and agreed with the warning message.

3. Type **Deactivate** in the first box to confirm your decision. You can also fill out the second box with the reason you decided to close your account.

4. Click **Deactivate Organization permanently** to confirm.
