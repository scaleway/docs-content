With the Scaleway console, you can use lifecycle rules to [manually](/storage/object/how-to/edit-storage-class/) or automatically change the storage class of your objects. These rules also allow users to set expiration dates for objects and their versions.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)

## How to create a lifecycle rule
1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the name of your bucket. The list of your objects displays.
3. Click **Lifecycle rules**.
4. Click **+ Create Lifecycle rule** to add a rule.
5. Enter a name for the rule.
6. Filter the objects you want the rule to be applied to by one or both of the following criteria:
    - [**Prefix**](/storage/object/concepts/#prefix): based on the object name and path. The defined rule will be applied to all objects with the same name [prefix](/storage/object/concepts/#prefix).
    - [**Tags**](/storage/object/concepts/#tags): comprised of a **key** and an associated **value**. These tags should be defined before rule creation, for either a bucket or an object. You can add one or more tags to your filter.

<Message type="important">
  Lifecycle rules are limited to 500,000 jobs per day. Beyond this limit, you can [transition](/storage/object/how-to/edit-storage-class/) or [delete](/storage/object/how-to/delete-an-object/) your objects manually. 
</Message>

## How to configure transition rules

If you wish to change the [storage class](/storage/object/concepts/#storage-class) of two or more objects at a time, you can set up a transition rule that will automate the process.

1. Click <Icon name="toggle" /> **Change object class** to transfer the current version of the objects to a different storage class.
2. Select the new storage class.
3. Enter the desired number of days before transition.
4. Click **Next step** to proceed.
5. Make sure all the information is correct, then click **Create Lifecycle rule** to confirm.

<Message type="important">
  Lifecycle rules only allow the following transitions:
  - Standard -> Onezone IA
  - Standard -> Glacier
  - Onezone IA -> Glacier

  Refer to the documentation on [how to manually change the storage class of your objects](/storage/object/how-to/edit-storage-class/) for more information.

## How to configure expiration rules

If you wish to delete an object after a set number of days, you can set up an expiration rule that will automate the process.

1. Click <Icon name="toggle" /> **Delete after expiration** to define when the current version of your objects will be deleted.
2. Enter the desired number of days before deletion.
3. Click **Next step** to proceed.
4. Check that all settings are correct and click **Create Lifecycle rule** to confirm.

## How to disable a lifecycle rule

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. A list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the name of your bucket.
3. Click the **Lifecycle rules** tab. A list of your rules displays.
4. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the rule name.
5. Click **Disable**. A confirmation window pops up.
6. Click **Disable lifecycle rule** to confirm.

<Message type="note">
Once disabled, the lifecycle rule remains listed and can be enabled again. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Activate** to do so.
</Message>
