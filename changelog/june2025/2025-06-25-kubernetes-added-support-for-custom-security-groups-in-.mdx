Starting now, users can provide a security group ID from their existing security groups when creating a Kapsule pool. If no security group ID is provided, the pool will use a default preconfigured security group named "Kapsule default security group", which is shared among all Kapsule pools in the same zone. The older behavior of creating a separate security group for each zone where the cluster had at least one pool has been discontinued.
