For each of your servers, you can order up to 64 flexible IPs. You can attach and detach any of your [Bare Metal flexible IPs](/compute/bare-metal-cloud/concepts/#flexible-ip) to and from any of your Bare Metal servers. The console provides a drag and drop view to facilitate the allocation of your flexible IPs.

<Message type="important">

  Note that Scaleway offers flexible IPs for [Bare Metal servers](/compute/bare-metal-cloud/concepts/#bare-metal-server), [Instances](/compute/instances/concepts/#instance) and [Public Gateways](/network/vpc/concepts/#public-gateway). Each of these sets of flexible IPs is independent, and usable only with that product. Instance flexible IPs cannot be attached to Bare Metal servers or Public Gateways, and vice versa.
