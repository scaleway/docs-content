The maximum RAM quota is obtained by multiplying the maximum scale factor of your container by the selected RAM quantity.
For example, if you choose to create a container with 512 MB of memory and a maximum scale of 20, you will have 10 GB RAM.

## NATS

Scaleway NATS is a message broker tool based on the NATS protocol, and it includes JetStream, a persistent messaging system for NATS.

The following usage limits are enforced as Organization quotas when using Scaleway [NATS](/nats/concepts/#nats-messaging-system). The quotas (except for the number of NATS accounts) relate to JetStream when used for persistent messaging, streams, and consumers.

**NATS**

| Resource                                       | Criteria   | Limits   | Scope        |
|------------------------------------------------|------------|----------|--------------|
| NATS account                                   | Max number | 10       | Organization |
| NATS message payload                           | Max size   | 512 KB   | Message      |
| NATS queue/stream storage                      | Max size   | 300 MB** | NATS account |
| NATS queue/stream memory                       | Max size   | 0        | NATS account |
| Max number of NATS streams                     | Max number | 50       | NATS account |
| Max number of NATS consumers                   | Max number | 50       | NATS stream  |

**This implies stream replication. If you choose to replicate your stream across all nodes (3), a storage limit of 100 MB applies.
Note that in memory stream are not supported, please create your NATS stream using the `File` storage type.

## Queues

Scaleway Queues is a product for creating managed messaging queues based on the [SQS](/queues/concepts/#sqs) protocol.
Limits that apply to regular queues also apply to [dead letter queues](/queues/concepts/#dead-letter-queue).
The following usage limits are enforced as Organization quotas when using Scaleway Queues:


| Resource                                       | Criteria   | Limits   | Scope            |
|------------------------------------------------|------------|----------|------------------|
| Queue storage                                  | Max size   | 100 MB** | Scaleway Project |
| Maximum payload                                | Max size   | 256 KB   | Queue            |
| Max number of queues                           | Max number | 50       | Scaleway Project |
| Message age / retention period                 | Max        | 14 days  | Message          |
| Visibility timeout                             | Max        | 12 hours | Queue            |

** This limit applies to all queues within your Scaleway Project, and covers the total storage used by all the queues in your Project.

## Topics and Events

Topics and Events is a product for creating managed messaging topics based on the [SNS](/topics-and-events/concepts/#sns) protocol. The following usage limits are enforced as Organization quotas when using Scaleway Topics and Events:

| Resource                                       | Criteria   | Limits   | Scope            |
|------------------------------------------------|------------|----------|------------------|
| Max number of topics                           | Max number | 50       | Scaleway Project |
| Max number of subscribers per topic            | Max number | 50       | Scaleway Project |

## Storage

Local and Block Storage options are available with our compute offers.

<Message type="note">
  Regardless of the quotas displayed below, be aware that:
    - A virtual Instance can bear up to 16 volumes, including the mandatory local volume. Therefore, the maximum number of block volumes that can be attached to an Instance is 15.
    - The maximum size of a block volume is 10 TB.
    - The maximum Local Storage for a DEV Instance depends on the DEV Instance type. For example, for the DEV1-XL the maximum Local Storage is 120 GB.
