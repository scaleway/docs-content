VPC Peering is currently in Public Beta, and available only via he Scaleway API. For specific API calls, read our API-based quickstart in the [Site-to-Site VPN API documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/vpc-peering/#quickstart).

Scaleway VPC Peering is a networking service that enables two Scaleway VPCs to establish a private peering connection. You can then securely route traffic between them, away from the public internet. For more details about VPC Peering, [read the Understanding VPC Peering page](/vpc-peering/referece-content/understanding-vpc-peering/)

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [A VPC](/vpc/how-to/create-vpc) over which you have appropriate [IAM permissions](/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/)
- The unique VPC ID of the VPC you want to peer with
- [Acivated routing](/vpc/how-to/manage-routing/#how-to-activate-routing) on both VPC peers

1. [Create a peering connector](TODO LINK TO API), defining your VPC as origin, and the VPC you want to peer with as target.

        <Message type="tip">
        Both VPCs must be in the same Scaleway region. They may be in different Projects/Organizations. The target VPC must be identified by its unique VPC ID.
        </Message>

        The peering connector will be in `Orphan` status, until the next step is carried out.

2. An owner or manager of the target VPC must create a matching peering connector on their end, defining their VPC as origin and your VPC as target.

        <Message type="tip">
        They will not receive any requests or notifications prompting them to create the matching connector. They must do this autonomously and independently.
        </Message>

3. Scaleway detects that two matching peering connectors have been created, and automatically carries out a compatibility check. This entails verifying that the Private Networks of the two VPCs do not contain any overlapping CIDR blocks.

        - If the two VPCs are compatible, both connectors go into `Peered` status, and the peering connection is created.
        - If the two VPCs have overlapping CIDR blocks, both connectors go into `Conflict` state. They cannot be peered until you [resolve the conflict](TODO).

4. [Create custom routes](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/vpc/#path-routes-create-a-route) in the route table of each peered VPC, to establish rules for routing traffic for the IP ranges you specify, across the peering connection.

        <Message type="tip">
        Creating custom routes is an essential step for facilitating the flow of traffic across the peering connection. Traffic will not be routed between the peered VPCs automatically or via any auto-created, managed routes.
        </Message>

5. When you no longer need your VPC peering connection, you and an owner of the matching connector can [delete your connectors](TODO).
