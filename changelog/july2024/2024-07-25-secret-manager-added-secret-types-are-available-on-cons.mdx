Secret types are now displayed on Console for better usability of Secrets.

All secrets not explicitly tagged appear as opaque, but you can now decide to create new secrets of a specific type (among opaque, Username/password, Database Credential, SSH Key, Certificate, Key/Value), and secrets versions will be of the same type.

Read [our documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/api-cli/create-secret-with-type/) for more details on how to use types in API.
