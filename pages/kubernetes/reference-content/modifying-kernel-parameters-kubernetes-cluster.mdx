Kernel parameters control the behavior of the operating system at runtime. They allow you to configure and fine-tune various aspects of the Linux kernel, such as networking, memory management, process handling, and security. These parameters are located in the `/proc/sys` directory on each node and can be dynamically modified at runtime using the `sysctl` command.

This guide outlines how to modify kernel parameters across all nodes in a Kubernetes cluster using a DaemonSet.

## Identifying the kernel parameters to modify

Kernel parameters, managed via the `sysctl` command, are grouped into different categories depending on which part of the kernel they influence:

- **Networking (`net.*`)**: Controls network-related settings such as buffer sizes, TCP/IP settings, and routing.
  *Example*: `net.ipv4.ip_forward` enables or disables IP packet forwarding, often used in routing scenarios.

- **Memory Management (`vm.*`)**: Manages memory and swap behaviors.
  *Example*: `vm.swappiness` controls how aggressively the system swaps memory pages to disk.

- **File System (`fs.*`)**: Configures file system-related limits and behaviors.
  *Example*: `fs.file-max` sets the maximum number of file descriptors the system can allocate.

- **General Kernel Settings (`kernel.*`)**: Configures overall kernel behaviors.
  *Example*: `kernel.hostname` defines the system’s hostname.

- **Security (`kernel.random.*`, `net.ipv4.conf.*`, etc.)**: Manages security settings such as IP forwarding, source address validation, and firewall rules.
  *Example*: `net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter` enables reverse path filtering for added network security.

- **Process Limits (`kernel.*`)**: Controls limits for processes, such as the maximum number of processes or threads.
  *Example*: `kernel.pid_max` sets the maximum number of process IDs (PIDs) the system can allocate.

## Creating a DaemonSet to modify kernel parameters

To apply kernel parameter changes across all nodes in the cluster, you can create a Kubernetes DaemonSet that runs privileged Pods. This will ensure the changes are applied to every node.

Create a YAML file (e.g., `sysctl-daemonset.yaml`), copy/paste the following content into the file, save it and exit the text editor:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: sysctl-tuning
  namespace: kube-system
  labels:
    app: sysctl-tuning
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: sysctl-tuning
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: sysctl-tuning
    spec:
      hostNetwork: true  # Share the host's network namespace for network-related sysctl changes
      hostPID: true  # Access the host's PID namespace for sysctl commands
      initContainers:
      - name: sysctl-init  # Init container to set sysctl parameters
        image: busybox:latest
        command:
        - /bin/sh
        - -c
        - |
          sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=7500000  # Set the maximum receive buffer size
          sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=7500000  # Set the maximum send buffer size
        securityContext:
          privileged: true  # Privileged access to modify sysctl settings on the host
      containers:
      - name: sleep-container  # Main container to keep the Pod running
        image: busybox:latest
        command:
        - /bin/sh
        - -c
        - sleep infinity  # Keep the Pod alive indefinitely
```

## Applying the DaemonSet

To apply the configuration, use the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f sysctl-daemonset.yaml
```

This command deploys the DaemonSet, which ensures that the kernel parameters are modified on all nodes.

## Verifying changes

To verify that the DaemonSet is running on all nodes, use the following command:

```bash
kubectl get daemonset -n kube-system
```

To check if the kernel parameters were successfully updated on a node, SSH into the node and run:

```bash
ssh <node-name>
sysctl net.core.rmem_max
sysctl net.core.wmem_max
```

<Message type="note">
    On Scaleway Kapsule SSH access is blocked by default. You need to enable SSH in your security group before connecting to the node. Refer to [How to enable or disable SSH ports on Kubernetes Kapsule cluster nodes](/kubernetes/how-to/enable-disable-ssh/) for further information.

## Cleaning up (Optional)

If the DaemonSet is no longer needed after the kernel parameters have been modified, you can delete it with the following command:

```bash
kubectl delete -f sysctl-daemonset.yaml
```
