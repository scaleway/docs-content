The process of managing a secret might differ depending on whether your secret is [ephemeral](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#ephemeral-secret) or not.

Find out how to copy the ID of your [secret](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#secret), how to update its description and tags, how to enable [secret protection](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#secret-protection) on it, and how to update its [ephemeral policy](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#ephemeral-policy) using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Generated an API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) and enabled the `SecretManagerFullAccess` [permission set](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/)
- [Created a secret](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/how-to/create-secret/)

          <Message type="important">
            Updating a secret's ephemeral policy impacts the secret's disabled versions when you enable them again: if you have created a version with the previous ephemeral policy's settings, disabled the version, and updated the ephemeral policy, the version will inherit its settings from those of the current policy when you enable it again.
