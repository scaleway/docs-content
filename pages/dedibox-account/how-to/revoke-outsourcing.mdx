Outsourced services refer to services managed by a different technical contact than the owner of the service. This technical contact, who is another Scaleway Dedibox account holder, can manage these services without requiring full access to the owner's Scaleway Dedibox account.

<Requirements />

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)

### How to revoke an outsourcing agreement

1. Log in to the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net).
2. Click your username next to _logged in as_ in the top right corner of the Dedibox console. Then select **Outsourcing** from the pop-up menu.
3. On the outsourcing page, navigate to the **Outsourced** tab to view a list of your outsourced services. Select the checkbox next to each service you want to revoke the outsourcing for:

4. Click **Remove selected roles** to confirm and initiate the revocation of outsourcing for the selected services.

    Once you complete these steps, the services will no longer be associated with the outsourced account, and the technical management will revert to the owner of the service.
    <Message type="note">
      Revoking the outsourcing of a service does not cancel its subscription. The service will remain active, but management control will revert to the owner.
