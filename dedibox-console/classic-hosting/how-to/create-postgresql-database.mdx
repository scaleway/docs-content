<Macro id="webhosting-online" />

PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system that uses the SQL language. It is open source and well known for its stability, reliability and strong community.

Compared with MySQL, PostgreSQL has the following advantages:

* Better compliance with SQL standards,
* Stricter data integrity,
* More native data types,
* Much more customizable/extensible (define custom data types and functions),
* More advanced support of transactions, stored procedures, triggers, and views,
* Asynchronous notifications and treatments,
* Better scalability.

However, it has the following limitations:

* More complex to understand,
* Replication is harder to implement,
* Generally less well-supported than MySQL in current projects (CMS, for example).
