## How to use it

### Sending Inference requests

To perform inference tasks with your WizardLM model deployed at Scaleway, use the following command:

```bash
curl -s \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <IAM API key>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--request POST \
--url "https://<Deployment UUID>.ifr.fr-par.scw.cloud/v1/chat/completions" \
--data '{"model":"wizardlm-70B-V1.0", "messages":[{"role": "user","content": "Say hello to Scaleway's Inference"}], "max_tokens": 200, "top_p": 1, "temperature": 1, "stream": false}'
```

Make sure to replace `<IAM API key>` and `<Deployment UUID>` with your actual [IAM API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) and the Deployment UUID you are targeting.

<Message type="note">
  Ensure that the `messages` array is properly formatted with roles (system, user, assistant) and content.
</Message>

### Receiving Managed Inference responses

Upon sending the HTTP request to the public or private endpoints exposed by the server, you will receive inference responses from the Managed Inference server. 
Process the output data according to your application's needs. The response will contain the output generated by the LLM model based on the input provided in the request.
