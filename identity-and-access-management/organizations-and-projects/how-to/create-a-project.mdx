If you have a [Scaleway account](/console/account/how-to/create-an-account), and subsequently an [Organization](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#organization), you will also automatically have a [default Project](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#default-project), that contains all your existing [resources](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#resource). You can also create additional Projects, allowing you to group your resources.

<Message type="note">
  The default Project inherits the Organization ID. Therefore, the **default** status cannot be transferred to other Projects, and the name of the default Project cannot be changed.

1. Click the **Projects** tab from the [Organization Dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/organization). A list of your Projects displays.
2. Click **+ Create Project** on the right-hand side. A pop-up displays.
3. Enter a **Project Name** and a **Project description** in the corresponding field.
4. Click **Create Project**.

    The new Project is added to the list.
