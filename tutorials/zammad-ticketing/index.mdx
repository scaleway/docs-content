## Zammad - Overview

[Zammad](https://zammad.org/) is an open source helpdesk system with features to manage customer communication via several channels including telephone, Facebook, Twitter, chat and emails. The software is completely open-source and released under version 3 of the GNU AFFERO General Public License (GNU AGPLv3).

In this tutorial you will learn how to install Zammad on a Virtual  Instance running on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa) and take a quick walk through the application. The different steps of this tutorial are:


<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your SSH Key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
  - You have an Instance running on Ubuntu Focal Fossa (20.04 LTS)
  - You have a domain name pointed to your Instance
</Message>

## Installing Elasticsearch

Zammad requires an [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) database to increase search performance and to support advanced features like reports or searching by email attachment contents. Start by installing the Elasticsearch engine on your Instance.

1. Connect to your Instance using [SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).
2. Update the `apt` package manager repository inventory and upgrade the software already installed on the Instance to the latest version available in the repositories:
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
3. Install the prerequisites for the installation of Elasticsearch:
    ```
    apt-get install apt-transport-https locales wget
    ```
4. Add the Elasticsearch repository to the `apt` package manager and install the Elasticsearch GPG key on your instance:
    ```
    echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main" | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list
    wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | apt-key add -
    ```
5. Update the `apt` package manager to include the new repository:
    ```
    apt update
    ```
6. Install Elasticsearch using `apt`:
    ```
    apt install elasticsearch
    ```
7. Zammad requires the [ingest-attachment](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/5.0/ingest-attachment.html) plugin for Elasticsearch. Install it by running the following command:
    ```
    /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-plugin install ingest-attachment
    ```
8. Restart `elasticsearch` and enable the service:
    ```
    systemctl restart elasticsearch.service
    systemctl enable elasticsearch.service
    ```

## Installing Zammad

1. Make sure that your system is using a `UTF-8` locale, otherwise the PostgreSQL database engine installation may fail. In this tutorial we use the locale `en_US.UTF-8`:
    ```
    locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
    echo "LANG=en_US.UTF-8" > /etc/default/locale
    ```
2. Add the Zammad repository to the `apt` package manager and install the Zammad GPG key on your system:
    ```
    sudo wget -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/zammad.list \
    https://dl.packager.io/srv/zammad/zammad/stable/installer/ubuntu/20.04.repo
    wget -qO- https://dl.packager.io/srv/zammad/zammad/key | sudo apt-key add -
    ```
3. Update the `apt` package manager to activate the new repository and install Zammad:
    ```
    apt update && apt install zammad -y
    ```
4. Configure Zammad with Elasticsearch by running the following two commands:
    ```
    zammad run rails r "Setting.set('es_url', 'http://localhost:9200')"
    zammad run rake searchindex:rebuild
    ```

## Configuring Nginx

Zammad uses the [Nginx](http://nginx.org/) web server to serve the application. In the following step you configure the web server application and request a TLS certificate, issued by the [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate authority, to secure the connection to between your users and agents using HTTPS. A domain name pointing to the IP address of your Virtual Cloud Instance is required for this step (A-Record).

1. Open the Nginx configuration file, generated by Zammad, in a text editor. In this tutorial we use `nano` to edit the file:
    ```
    nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/zammad.conf
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      Please do not rename or move this file. Zammad will regenerate it, if the file is not available.
    </Message>
2. Look out for the `server {` block and replace the server's hostname `localhost` with your domain name. In this tutorial we use `zammad.example.com`:
    ```
    [...]
    server {
        listen 80;

        # replace 'localhost' with your fqdn if you want to use zammad from remote
        server_name localhost;
    [...]
    ```

    Once edited, save the file by pressing `CTRL`+`O`, then leave the editor by pressing `CTRL`+`X`.
3. Reload the Nginx configuration files to activate the new configuration:
    ```
    service nginx reload
    ```
4. Install `certbot`, a tool requesting the TLS certificate for the Let's Encrypt CA and doing all the required Nginx configuration for you:
    ```
    apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
    ```
5. Run `certbot`:
    ```
    certbot --nginx
    ```

    Follow the prompts and provide the requested information to certbot. Certbot will automatically request the certificate and reconfigure Nginx for HTTPS connections. For more information refer to our [dedicated documentation](/tutorials/configure-nginx-lets-encrypt/#installing-certbot-and-obtaining-a-certificate).

## Setting up Zammad

1. Open a web browser and point it to your Zammad installation (in our tutorial: `https://zammad.example.com`).
2. The interactive setup wizard displays. Click **Setup new system** to start the configuration of the tool.
3. Enter the required information for the administrator account and validate the form by clicking **Create**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-zammad_01.webp" alt="" />
4. Enter the required information about your organization. You can upload your company logo to customize the installation. Make sure the **System URL** corresponds with your domain name (`zammad.example.com` in our example):
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-zammad_02.webp" alt="" />
5. Choose how you want to deliver your emails. You can either use a local mail server, installed on your instance, or use an external mailing service by using SMTP:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-zammad_03.webp" alt="" />

  Enter the SMTP details of either the local MTA or the information you received from your messaging service.
6. To configure the email channel, click the **Email** button and enter the account POP3/IMAP information for your incoming mails.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-zammad_04.webp" alt="" />
7. You have completed the basic installation of Zammad. The agent dashboard displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-zammad_05.webp" alt="" />

    Your users and agents can now communicate efficiently by email and by logging into their helpdesk interface.

## Creating additional users

Currently your Zammad application has only the admin user. In the following step we create additional accounts for users and agents.

Zammad proposes three default roles of user accounts:

- **Customer:** Users who create tickets and ask for help.
- **Agent:** Your agents who deal with the requests made by your customers.
- **Admin:** Admin accounts have full control over the Zammad instance and can manage the system.

If required, you can create more detailed roles by adding more and allowing or disallowing features on a more finely granulated level.

1. From the Zammad dashboard click the cogwheel icon (1) to enter the management section of the system.
2. In the users section (2) of the management panel, click **New user** (3) to create a new account.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-zammad_06.webp" alt="" />
3. Enter the account information of the new user and tick the checkbox corresponding to its role on the application. Once all information is provided, click **Submit** to create the new user account.
    <Message type="tip">
      To create a large number of user accounts, you can also use the bulk upload feature to upload a file in the comma separated values (CSV) format. It must be saved as UTF-8.
    </Message>

## Creating additional channels

For now, your Zammad instance allows you to communicate with your users by e-mail, but the application provides a wide range of connectors to interact with your customers. You can configure modules for:

- Twitter
- Facebook
- Telegram
- Chat
- SMS (via twilio)

and much more.

1. Click the cogwheel icon (1) to enter the management section of Zammad.
2. Scroll down to the **Channels** section (2) and choose the communication channel you want to configure (3).
3. The configuration options vary depending on the channel you want to configure.
