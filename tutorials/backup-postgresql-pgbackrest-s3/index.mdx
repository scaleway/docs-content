## pgBackRest Overview
pgBackRest aims to be a reliable, easy-to-use backup and restore solution that can seamlessly scale up to the largest databases and workloads by utilizing algorithms that are optimized for database-specific requirements.

pgBackRest can back up in three ways:
- Full backup: This is a backup of every file under the database directory ($PGDATA). A full backup of a PostgreSQL server is required first. It is the only backup that pgBackRest can load by itself.
- Differential backup: This only retrieves files that have changed since the last full backup. Both the full backup and the differential backup must be intact.
- Incremental backup: This retrieves files that have changed since the last backup. The last backup can be a full backup or a differential backup.

## Installing pgBackRest

The **PostgreSQL Global Development Group (PGDG)** provides an apt and yum repository. After importing the repository, you can install the PgBouncer package.

For Ubuntu/Debian:
1. Create the file repository configuration:
    ```
    sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'
    ```
2. Import the repository signing key:
    ```
    wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | apt-key add -
    ```
3. Update the package lists:
    ```
    apt update
    ```
4. Install the `pgbackrest` package
    ```
    apt install -y pgbackrest
    ```

For RHEL/Rocky Linux:
1. Install the repository RPM:
    ```
    dnf install -y https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/reporpms/EL-9-x86_64/pgdg-redhat-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```
2. Disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:
    ```
    dnf -qy module disable postgresql
    ```
3. Install the `pgbackrest` package
    ```
    dnf install -y pgbackrest
    ```

## Setting up pgBackRest

1. Edit the `/etc/pgbackrest.conf` with the following changes (repository configurations for example purposes only):
    ```
    [global]
    repo1-type=s3
    repo1-s3-endpoint=<BUCKET-ENDPOINT>
    repo1-s3-bucket=<BUCKET-NAME>
    repo1-s3-key=<ACCESS-KEY>
    repo1-s3-key-secret=<SECRET-KEY>
    repo1-s3-region=<REGION>
    repo1-path=/pgbackrest

    repo1-retention-full=1
    start-fast=y
    archive-async=y

    [db-primary]
    pg1-path=/var/lib/pgsql/14/data
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      PostgreSQL data directory is `/var/lib/postgresql/14/main` in Ubuntu/Debian by default
    </Message>
2. Create a stanza for defining the cluster:
    ```
    sudo -u postgres pgbackrest --stanza=db-primary stanza-create
    ```

## Setting up PostgreSQL

1. Edit the PostgreSQL configuration file `/etc/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.conf` as follows:
    ```
    archive_mode = on
    archive_command = 'pgbackrest --stanza=db-primary archive-push %p'
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      Changing the `archive_mode` parameter requires a restart, but a reload is sufficient if you are only changing the `archive_command` parameter.
    </Message>

    <Message type="note">
      If you want WAL archiving to be done only during backup, you can add the following command:
      ```
      test -f /tmp/pgbackrest/db-primary-backup.lock || exit 0 && pgbackrest --stanza=db-primary archive-push %p
      ```
      It is not a method supported by pgBackRest. This should be monitored carefully.
    </Message>
2. Restart PostgreSQL to apply the changes:

    For RHEL/Rocky Linux:

    Restart the `postgresql-14.service` to apply the changes.
    ```
    systemctl restart postgresql-14.service
    ```

    For Ubuntu/Debian:

    Restart the PostgreSQL 14 `main` cluster to apply the changes.
    ```
    pg_ctlcluster restart 14 main
    ```
3. Use the following command to check the configuration:
    ```
    sudo -u postgres pgbackrest --stanza=db-primary check
    ```

## Performing backups

- To start a full backup for db-primary, use this command:
    ```
    sudo -u postgres pgbackrest --stanza=db-primary --type=full backup
    ```
- To start a differential backup for db-primary, use this command:
    ```
    sudo -u postgres pgbackrest --stanza=db-primary --type=diff backup
    ```
- To start an incremental backup for db-primary, use this command:
    ```
    sudo -u postgres pgbackrest --stanza=db-primary --type=incr backup
    ```
- To view a list of all backups available of db-primary, use this command:
    ```
    sudo -u postgres pgbackrest --stanza=db-primary info
    ```

<Message type="note">
  If there are no existing backups for a stanza, the backup type will be set to full.
</Message>


## Restoring from backups

- To restore from backup to the same location on the DB server, you can start the restore process with the following command:
    ```
    sudo -u postgres pgbackrest --stanza=db-primary restore
    ```
- To restore from backup to the same location on the DB server and at a specified time, you can start the restore process with the following command:
    ```
    sudo -u postgres pgbackrest --stanza=db-primary --type=time --target="2022-06-02 17:05:23" restore
    ```
- To restore from backup to a desired location on the DB server, you can start the restore process with the following command:
    ```
    sudo -u postgres pgbackrest --stanza=db-primary --reset-pg1-host --pg1-path=/var/lib/pgsql/14/restored restore
    ```

<Message type="tip">
  A full restore can take a long time on large databases. If the connection is lost, the restoration process may be interrupted. For this reason, running the restore command in `screen` or `tmux` will increase reliability.
</Message>

<Message type="note">
  If only missing files need to be added, you can use the `--delta` parameter. This parameter restores only missing files.
</Message>


## Automatizing backups
If you want to back up at certain time intervals, you can add this to the cron:

1. Edit the crontab of the postgres user:
    ```
    crontab -u postgres -e
    ```
2. Add the following line to the crontab and save it. This particular example runs a full backup at 00:00 on every Wednesday and an incremental backup at 00:00 on every Saturday:
    ```
    0 0 * * 3 /usr/bin/pgbackrest --stanza=db-primary --type=full backup
    0 0 * * 6 /usr/bin/pgbackrest --stanza=db-primary --type=incr backup
    ```

## Deleting old backups manually:

- To keep only the last full backup:
    ```
    sudo -u postgres pgbackrest --stanza=db-primary --repo1-retention-full=1 expire
    ```
- To keep only the last differential backup:
    ```
    sudo -u postgres pgbackrest --stanza=db-primary --repo1-retention-diff=1 expire
    ```
