This tutorial guides you through the process of migrating your Instance's Local Storage (`l_ssd`) to Scaleway Block Storage (SBS). 
By following these steps, you will be able to export your local storage and restart your Instance with SBS.

<Requirements />
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) using [Local Storage (`l_ssd`)](/local-storage/)
- An [Object Storage bucket](/object-storage/how-to/create-a-bucket/) in the same geographical region as your Instance

## Creating a snapshot of your Local Storage volume

To begin the migration process, you need to create a snapshot of your Local Storage volume. This will allow you to export the snapshot and import it into a new SBS volume.

1. Click **CPU & GPU Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The [Instances page](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) displays.
2. Click the Instance you want to snapshot.
3. Click the **Storage** tab to display the storage options of your Instance.
4. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Snapshot** next to the volume you want to snapsot.
5. A pop-up displays. Choose a **name** for the snapshot, or use the default suggested name.
6. Click **Create snapshot** to finish. You are redirected to the **Snapshots** tab in the **Local Storage** section of the Scaleway console, where your new snapshot now appears in the list.

## Exporting the snapshot

Once you have created the snapshot, you need to export it. This will allow you to import the snapshot into a new SBS volume.

1. Click the [snapshots](https://console.scaleway.com/local-storage/snapshots) tab in the **Local Storage** section of the Scaleway console.
2. A list of your Local Storage snapshots displays. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Copy to bucket**.
3. A pop-up displays. Enter a name for the QCOW2 export of your snapshot and select the Object Storage bucket to export your snapshot into from the drop-down list.
    <Message type="note">
      The Object Storage bucket must be in the same region as your snapshot.
    </Message>
4. Click **Copy snapshot to bucket** to start the export.

## Importing the snapshot into a new SBS volume

After exporting the snapshot, you need to import it into a new SBS volume. This will create a new volume with the same data as your local storage volume.

1. Click the [Object Storage section](https://console.scaleway.com/object-storage/buckets) of the Scaleway console, then click the bucket to which you have exported the snapshot. The snapshot copy should display in the list of your objects.
    <Message type="note">
    Depending on the size of your snapshot, the export to Object Storage may take some time. It is ready once the status indicator changes to green.
    </Message>
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the snapshot copy, then click **Import as snapshot**. A pop-up displays. Enter the name of the snapshot, select the destination AZ, and choose the snapshot type.
    Select **Block SSD** as the snapshot type. Click **Import file as snapshot** to import the snapshot into the destination AZ.
    <Message type="important">
      - Ensure that the QCOW / QCOW2 image file you want to import uses the file extension `.qcow` or `.qcow2` to avoid issues during import.
      - Imported snapshots must have a volume size between 1 GB and 1 TB.
    </Message>

## Attaching the new SBS volume to your Instance

Once the new SBS volume is created, you need to attach it to your instance. This will allow you to use the new volume as your primary storage.

1. Click **Block Storage** in the **Storage** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The Block Storage page displays.
2. Click **Attach an Instance** under the **Linked Instance** section.
3. Select the Instance to which you want to attach your volume from the drop-down.
4. Click **Attach volume to Instance**.

<Message type="tip">
  Alternatively you can [create a new Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) and use the SBS volume as boot volume for your Instance.
</Message>

## Restarting your Instance

After attaching the new SBS volume, you need to restart your instance. This will ensure that your Instance is using the new SBS volume as its primary storage.

1. Click **CPU & GPU Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The [Instances page](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) displays.
2. Click the Instance you want to reboot.
3. Click **Actions** > **Reboot** in the top right corner of the Instance overview page.
4. A pop-up displays to confirm the Instance reboot. Click **Reboot Instance**.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you have successfully migrated your local storage (`l_ssd`) to Scaleway Block Storage (SBS).
Your Instance is now up and running using SBS, and you can benefit from the advantages of Scaleway's advanced Block Storage solution.

<Message type="note">
  This tutorial does not cover specific modifications done by the user in the Instance that would break the mounting system.
  If you have made any modifications, ensure that they are compatible with SBS before proceeding with the migration.
