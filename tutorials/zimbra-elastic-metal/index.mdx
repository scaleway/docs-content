## Zimbra - Overview

The **Zimbra Open Source Collaboration Suite** is designed to provide an end-to-end mail solution that is scalable and highly reliable. It consists of both a client and server components.

The web client provides a full-featured collaboration suite that supports email and group calendars.

The complete messaging architecture is built using open technology and well-known standards. It provides POP3 and IMAP access and relies on open-source applications such as Postfix, ClamAV and SpamAssassin.

During this tutorial you will learn how to install the latest version of open-source version of Zimbra on a [Elastic Metal server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/elastic-metal/) running on Ubuntu Bionic Beaver server.

## Installing Zimbra Open Source Edition

1. Connect to your server using SSH:
    ```code
    ssh root@SERVER_IP
    ```
2. Update your system to the latest version:
    ```code
    apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
    ```
3. Edit your `/etc/hosts` file so it looks like the following example:
    ```code
    51.159.31.9   zimbra.example.com     zimbra
    127.0.0.1       localhost
    ```
4. Configure the DNS settings of your server by editing the file `/etc/resolv.conf`. Set it to `62.210.16.6` and `62.210.16.7` to use Scaleway's DNS servers.
    ```code
    nameserver 62.210.16.6
    nameserver 62.210.16.7
    ```
5. [Download](https://www.zimbra.com/downloads/zimbra-collaboration-open-source/) and extract the latest version of Zimbra
    ```code
    wget https://files.zimbra.com/downloads/8.8.15_GA/zcs-8.8.15_GA_3869.UBUNTU18_64.20190918004220.tgz
    tar xfz zcs-8.8.15_GA_3869.UBUNTU18_64.20190918004220.tgz
    ```

    <Message type="important">
      Request the download link for the latest version directly from Zimbra to make sure you are installing the latest version available.
    </Message>
6. Enter the Zimbra directory:
    ```code
    cd zcs-*
    ```
7. Run the Zimbra installation tool:
    ```code
    ./install.sh
    ```
8. Confirm that you agree to the software license, by typing `y`:
    ```code
    Do you agree with the terms of the software license agreement? [N]y
    ```
9. Confirm that you want to use the repository of Zimbra, by pressing on `Enter`:
    ```code
    Use Zimbra's package repository [Y]
    ```
10. Zimbra will ask you which packages to install. You can keep the default values confirm their installation by typing `y`:
    ```code
    Select the packages to install

    Install zimbra-ldap [Y]

    Install zimbra-logger [Y]

    Install zimbra-mta [Y]

    [...]
    ```
11. Confirm the modification of the system by pressing `Y`:
    ```code
    The system will be modified.  Continue? [N]
    ```

    > The required packages will be downloaded and installed. This may take a while.
12. By default Zimbra is configured to use the domain name `zimbra.example.com`. Set it to your own domain name which you want to use for Zimbra, for example `mydomain.com`
    ```code
    DNS ERROR resolving MX for zimbra.example.com
    It is suggested that the domain name have an MX record configured in DNS
    Change domain name? [Yes] Y
    Create domain: [zimbra.example.com] mydomain.com
      MX: zimbra.mydomain.com (123.123.123.123)

      Interface: 127.0.0.1
      Interface: 123.123.123.123

    done.
    ```
13. The Zimbra store configuration displays. Check the configuration:

    ```

The installation of Zimbra Open Source is complete now and you can continue with the configuration of your collaboration suite.

## Configuring Zimbra Open Source Edition

1. You can now login to the admin console at `https://YOUR_SERVER_IP:7071/zimbraAdmin/`. Use the user `admin@domin.tld` and the password that you have set during the installation to login:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-zimbra-admin-login.webp" alt="" />
2. Once you are logged you can click **Get Started** to begin with the configuration of the Zimbra server:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-zimbra-admin-logged.webp" alt="" />

Add users and accounts as required.

## Logging into Zimbra Open Source Edition

The user interface of your Zimbra collaboration suite is available at `https://YOUR_SERVER_IP`. Use your complete email address and password to login:

<Lightbox src="scaleway-zimbra-interface.webp" alt="" />

You can now check your emails, manage your contacts and your calendar.

## Securing the Connection to Zimbra

By default Zimbra uses a self-signed certificate which can cause warnings in a web browser. To avoid these warnings, request a free [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) TLS/SSL certificate.

1. Log into to your server, as `root` user, via SSH, add the [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) repository, and install `certbot` to manage the certificate:
    ```code
    apt install software-properties-common -y
    add-apt-repository universe
    add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
    apt update
    apt install certbot -y
    ```
2. Switch into the Zimbra user:
    ```code
    su zimbra
    ```
3. Stop the following services:
    ```code
    zmproxyctl stop
    zmmailboxdctl stop
    ```
4. Exit from the Zimbra user:
    ```code
    exit
    ```
5. Lauch the following command to use the `certonly` feature of certbot:
    ```
    certbot certonly --standalone
    ```

    Fill in the required information when asked. If you need a certificate for multiple domain names, specify them with the `-d`-flag:

    ```
    certbot certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.org
    ```
6. The certificate has been issued once the following message appears:
    ```
      Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
      /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem
      Your key file has been saved at:
      /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem
    ```

    You can find the following files in the directory `/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com`:

      - **cert.pem** is the certificate

      - **chain.pem** is the chain

      - **fullchain.pem** is the concatenation of cert.pem + chain.pem

      - **privkey.pem** is the private key

    Lets Encrypt creates the `chain.pem` file without the root CA. Copy the [IdenTrust root Certificate](https://www.identrust.com/certificates/trustid/root-download-x3.html) and merge it after the `chain.pem`. The root certificate is available for download [here](https://letsencrypt.org/certs/trustid-x3-root.pem.txt):

    Your `chain.pem` should look like:

    ```code
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    YOUR_CERTIFICATE
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    ```

    > In short: chain.pem has to be merged with the root CA. First your certificate chain, and the end of the file the root CA. The order is important.
7. Copy the Let's Encrypt folder with all files `/etc/letsencrypt/live/zimbra.example.com` into `/opt/zimbra/ssl/letsencrypt`:
    ```code
    mkdir /opt/zimbra/ssl/letsencrypt
    mv /etc/letsencrypt/live/mydomain.com/* /opt/zimbra/ssl/letsencrypt/
    chown zimbra:zimbra /opt/zimbra/ssl/letsencrypt/*
    ```
8. Change into the Zimbra user:
    ```code
    su zimbra
    ```
9. Verify the certificate:
    ```code
    cd /opt/zimbra/ssl/letsencrypt/
    /opt/zimbra/bin/zmcertmgr verifycrt comm privkey.pem cert.pem chain.pem
    ```

    If everything is working fine, the following message will appear:

    ```code
    ** Verifying 'cert.pem' against 'privkey.pem'
    Certificate 'cert.pem' and private key 'privkey.pem' match.
    ** Verifying 'cert.pem' against 'chain.pem'
    Valid certificate chain: cert.pem: OK
    ```
10. Backup the existing certificate:
    ```code
    cp -a /opt/zimbra/ssl/zimbra /opt/zimbra/ssl/zimbra.$(date "+%Y%m%d")
    ```
11. Copy the private key into Zimbra's SSL path:
    ```code
    cp /opt/zimbra/ssl/letsencrypt/privkey.pem /opt/zimbra/ssl/zimbra/commercial/commercial.key
    ```
12. Finally deploy the SSL certificate:
    ```code
    /opt/zimbra/bin/zmcertmgr deploycrt comm cert.pem chain.pem
    ```

    <Message type="note">
    This may take a little while
    </Message>
13. Restart the Zimbra services:
    ```code
    zmcontrol restart
    ```
14. Go to `https://YOUR_SERVER_IP` and you will notice that the connection is now signed by a valid certificate:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-zimbra-with-ssl.webp" alt="" />

    <Message type="note">
      If you are using Zimbra on an Instance, note that the internal IP address might change after a stop/restart of your instance.
    </Message>

You have now successfully installed the Zimbra Collaboration Suite and secured it with Let's Encrypt certificate.
