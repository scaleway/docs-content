The AWS-CLI is an open-source tool built on top of the [AWS SDK for Python (Boto)](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) that provides commands for interacting with AWS services. With minimal configuration, you can start using all the functionalities provided by AWS Management.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)

  This page explains how to install the AWS-CLI v2. If you want to follow the installation procedure for v1, refer to the official [AWS-CLI documentation page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) for more information. Furthermore, you must install the `awscli-plugin-endpoint` to allow the AWS-CLI v1 to interact with Scaleway Object Storage.

## How to install the AWS-CLI

1. Follow the official [AWS CLI installation instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html#getting-started-install-instructions) to download and install the tool according to your environment.

2. Create the file `~/.aws/config` by running the following command:

    ```
    aws configure
    ```

3. When prompted, enter the following elements:
    - your API access key
    - your API secret key
    - your preferred default S3 region (`fr-par`, `nl-ams`, or `pl-waw`)
    - `json` as the default output format

4. Open the `~/.aws/config` file in a code editor and edit it as follows:

    ```
    [default]
    region = nl-ams
    output = json
    services = scw-nl-ams
    s3 =
      max_concurrent_requests = 100
      max_queue_size = 1000
      multipart_threshold = 50 MB
      # Edit the multipart_chunksize value according to the file sizes that you
      # want to upload. The present configuration allows to upload files up to
      # 10 GB (1000 requests * 10 MB). For example, setting it to 5 GB allows you
      # to upload files up to 5 TB.
      multipart_chunksize = 10 MB

    [services scw-nl-ams]
    s3 =
      endpoint_url = https://s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      Set the `endpoint_url` and `region` corresponding to the geographical region of your bucket. It can either be `fr-par` (Paris, France), `nl-ams` (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) or `pl-waw` (Warsaw, Poland).
    </Message>

    You can also configure additional profiles by adding new blocks under `[default]`. For example, you can add a second profile, `[profile two]`, to set a different region and endpoint from your default one:

    ```
    [default]
    region = nl-ams
    services = scw-nl-ams
    ...


    [profile two]
    region = fr-par
    services = scw-fr-par
    ...
    ```

5. Optionally, open the `~/.aws/credentials` file and create other profiles by adding a block to indicate their credentials as follows:

    ```
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id=<ACCESS_KEY>
    aws_secret_access_key=<SECRET_KEY>

    [two]
    aws_access_key_id=<ACCESS_KEY>
    aws_secret_access_key=<SECRET_KEY>
    ```

6. Run the following command to test your AWS CLI installation:

    ```
    aws s3 ls
    ```

    A list of your buckets in the region specified in your profile displays.

    <Message type="note">
        Use the `--profile` option if you want to test it using a different profile. Remember to replace `two` with the name of your profile. 
        ```
        aws --profile two s3 ls
        ```
