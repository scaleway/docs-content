The [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) lists your Object Storage incomplete multipart uploads to allow you to consult and manually delete them to clear storage space and optimize your storage costs.

You can automate the process of aborting incomplete multipart uploads using [lifecycle rules](/storage/object/how-to/manage-lifecycle-rules).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)
- At least one incomplete [multipart upload](/storage/object/api-cli/multipart-uploads/)

## How to view the information of an incomplete multipart upload

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the name of your bucket. The list of your objects displays.
3. Click the **Incomplete MPU** tab. A list of your incomplete multipart uploads displays.
4. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the Object you want to consult.
