<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/)
- At least one [snapshot](/instances/how-to/create-a-snapshot/)

## Creating an image from a snapshot via the Scaleway console

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The [Instances page](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) displays.
2. Click the **Images** tab. A list of your images displays.
3. Hover over the <Icon name="plus" /> button to **Create image**. The overview page displays.
4. Choose the **Availability Zone** in which you want your image to be created.
5. Enter a **name** for your image.
    <Message type="note">
      Your image's name can only contain alphanumeric characters and dashes.

## Creating an image via the Scaleway CLI

You can also create an image using the [Scaleway CLI](/scaleway-cli/quickstart/). Use the following command:

```bash
scw instance image create snapshot-id="$SCW_VOLUME_ID_1" additional-volumes.0.id="$SCW_VOLUME_ID_2" arch="x86_64"
```

- Replace `$SCW_VOLUME_ID_1` with the ID of the snapshot or volume you want to use as the root volume.
- Replace `$SCW_VOLUME_ID_2` with the ID of any additional volume to be included.
- Ensure the architecture (`arch`) is set to a valid value (e.g., `x86_64`).

<Message type="note">
  Supported volume IDs include:
  - Local Storage volumes (`l_ssd`)
  - Block Storage Low Latency volumes (`sbs`)
  - Block Storage legacy (`b_ssd`) volumes (deprecated).

## Creating an image via the Scaleway API

You can also create an image using the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/#path-images-create-an-instance-image). Use the following `curl` command:

```bash
curl --location "https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/$SCW_AVAILABILITY_ZONE/images" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
--data '{
    "root_volume": "'$SCW_VOLUME_ID_1'",
    "arch": "x86_64",
    "name": "image_name",
    "extra_volumes": {
        "1": {"id":"'$SCW_VOLUME_ID_2'"}
    },
    "project": "'$SCW_PROJECT_ID'"
}'
```

- Replace `$SCW_VOLUME_ID_1` with the ID of the snapshot or volume to use as the root volume.
- Replace `$SCW_VOLUME_ID_2` with the ID of any additional volume.
- Use `$SCW_PROJECT_ID` for the ID of your project.
- Ensure the architecture (`arch`) is set to a valid value (e.g., `x86_64`).
