All Instance offers, including DEV, GP, RENDER, and Stardust can now boot on Block volumes. This type of storage is safer and can be moved from one Instance to another.
Make sure you check our [documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) to create an Instance booting on a block volume or to [change the boot volume](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes/#how-to-change-the-boot-volume) of your Instance.

For API users, note that the local volume `min_size` returned by a call to `/instance/v1/zones/{zone}/products/servers` is now `0`, whereas it was previously equal to the `max_size`.

Be careful if you are using this value in your automation scripts, as trying to create an Instance with a local volume of size `0` will fail.

  This impacts our Terraform provider. We have currently implemented a workaround, which will be deprecated when the next release of Terraform is available. Make sure to keep your Terraform up to date.
