All users are able to view and delete their own API keys as necessary. API keys can also be edited, to change the description or [preferred Project](/identity-and-access-management/iam/api-cli/using-api-key-object-storage/). Instructions for these actions are given below. If you are the Owner of your Organization, or have [sufficient permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/permission-sets) to do so, you can also view and delete the API keys of other IAM users, and of IAM applications.

## How to view, edit and delete your own API keys

</Message>

1. Click **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** from the top-right of your [**Organization Dashboard**](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) in the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) displays.

2. Click your name in the list of users. You are taken to your user dashboard.
    <Message type="note">
      It is possible that you will only see yourself in the list of users. This happens when you do not have the required [permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/) to list users in the Organization. 
    </Message>
3. Click the **Credentials** tab. The following screen displays:

5. Edit the description and/or [preferred Project](/identity-and-access-management/iam/api-cli/using-api-key-object-storage/) of the API key as required, and click **Validate**.  
    The API key is edited, and you are returned to the list of API keys. To delete an API key, continue to the next steps.
6. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the API key you wish to delete, and select **Delete**.  
    A warning displays, reminding you that this action is permanent.
