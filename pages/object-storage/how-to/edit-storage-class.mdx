Scaleway Object Storage offers several [storage classes](/object-storage/concepts/#storage-class) to choose from depending on the performance, access, resiliency, and cost requirements of your workloads. The [Scaleway console](https://console/) allows you to edit the storage class of objects individually.

<Message type="note">
To change the storage class of several or all objects in a bucket, create a [lifecycle rule](/object-storage/how-to/manage-lifecycle-rules/).

      If you transfer objects to `Glacier` class, you might have to restore your data at a later date. To facilitate the steps of restoration and ensure fast restitution of your data, we recommend you use average-sized files (larger than 1 MB).
