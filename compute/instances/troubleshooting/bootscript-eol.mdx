On certain older legacy Instance types (e.g. VC1, VC2, and VC3) the option to use a bootscript (a preconfigured boot configuration) to start your Instances was proposed. However, this option has become deprecated and will no longer be supported. 
If you are still using one of these Instance types, you have to change your boot configuration in order to maintain your Instance operational.
