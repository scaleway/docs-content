You may have problems with connectivity between resources in a VPC or Private Network, or issues with routing packets.

This page helps you solve potential errors that are related to VPC connectivity and routing.

## My Managed Database cannot communicate with other resources in my VPC

This is normal, as VPC routing is not yet supported by Managed Databases for PostgreSQL or Managed Databases for Redis. Adding support for Managed Databases is planned for the future.

## I cannot deactivate routing on my VPC

This is standard behavior:

- Once you have activated routing on a VPC, you cannot deactivate it
- You do not have the option to create a new VPC where routing is deactivated

## I cannot route between VPCs/Private Networks in different regions, or different Scaleway Projects.

Currently, routing is only supported between Private Networks in a single VPC. We do not support:

- Routing between two different VPCs
- Routing between Private Networks in different Scaleway Projects, or different regions

Watch out for our VPC Peering solution, planned for the future, which will enable communication between different VPCs.

## I am experiencing issues with Elastic Metal server connectivity to a Private Network

Note that some manual configuration of the network interface is required when attaching Elastic Metal servers to Private Networks. Follow the steps in our [dedicated documentation](/elastic-metal/how-to/use-private-networks/#how-to-configure-the-network-interface-on-your-elastic-metal-server-for-private-networks).

## I am experiencing issues with VM (hosted on Elastic Metal server) connectivity to a Private Network

Ensure you have correctly attached the VM to the Private Network by specifying the MAC address, and carried out the necessary configuration of the network interface for your VM, e.g. [via the Proxmox interface](/tutorials/setup-elastic-metal-proxmox-cluster-with-private-networks/#configuring-the-private-network).

<Message type="tip">
Using the same MAC address on VMs in different AZs, or switching such MAC addresses between AZs, is not compatible with VPC routing. Ensure each VM has a unique MAC address.

## My resources cannot communicate via their hostnames

See our dedicated documentation on [resolving private DNS errors](/vpc/troubleshooting/private-dns-dhcp-not-working/).

## I am experiencing other connectivity issues

Check the [Scaleway Status page](https://status.scaleway.com/), to see whether there are any ongoing incidents which could affect the connectivity or network access of your resources.
