Access logs are now available in Cockpit for buckets in Amsterdam and Warsaw, making Object Storage logs available in all Scaleway regions!

Access logs are invaluable tools that record detailed information about every interaction with your objects. These logs include essential data such as who accessed your objects, when they accessed them, and from which IP address. With access logs enabled, you can gain deeper insights into how your data is being used, and enhance your security and compliance efforts.
