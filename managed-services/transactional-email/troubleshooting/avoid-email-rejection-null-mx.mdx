When using Scaleway's Transactional Email service, you might have [set a null MX record](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/add-mx-record-to-your-domain/#how-to-add-a-null-mx-record) to avoid receiving emails on your domain.
However, your emails might be rejected with a message such as `Sender address rejected: Domain yourdomain.com does not accept mail (nullMX)`. This documentation shows you how to solve this issue.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />
 
<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/).
  - You have a domain name.
  - You have [configured your domain with Transactional Email](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/configure-domain-with-transactional-email).
  - You have [added SPF and DKIM records](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/add-spf-dkim-records-to-your-domain/) to your domain.
  - You have [set a null MX record](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/add-mx-record-to-your-domain/#how-to-add-a-null-mx-record).
</Message>

1. Add an [MX record](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#mx-record) type in the root zone of your domain on your DNS zone.
2. Set the priority to `0`.
3. Enter `mx.yourdomain.com` in the **Hostname** field. Make sure you replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain.
4. Save your newly-added MX record.
5. Add an A record.
        <Message type="note">
         A records or address records are mostly used to map domain names to the IPv4 address of a specific server.
        </Message>
6. Enter `mx` in the **Name** (or **Hostname**) field.
7. Enter `127.0.0.1` as a value.
