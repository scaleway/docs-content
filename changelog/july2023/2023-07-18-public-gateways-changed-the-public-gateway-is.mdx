With the release of VPC in GA, Public Gateway no longer supports the DHCP server.
Public Gateway now focuses on its primary functions such as:
- Internet access: allowing external traffic to access the internal resources of a Private Network
- NAT-Gateway: distributing requests to the right IP addresses
- SSH Bastion: allowing and monitoring SSH connections
- Local DNS server: customizing resource names on the Private Network

See our [dedicated documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/network/vpc/reference-content/vpc-migration/) for full details.
