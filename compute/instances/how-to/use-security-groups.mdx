[Security Groups](/compute/instances/concepts#security-group) act as firewalls, filtering traffic on your Instances. They can be stateful or stateless, and allow you to create rules to drop or allow traffic to and from your Instance. On this page, we show you how to create, edit and configure a security group via the Scaleway console.

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance)

</Message>

## How to create a security group

1. Click **Instances** (A) in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Instances dashboard displays.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-security-groups.png" alt="" />

2. Click the **Security Groups** tab (B). The Security Groups dashboard displays.

  <Message type="note">

  You will see that at least one **Default security group** already exists in your account. A default security group is auto-generated for each [Availability Zone](/compute/instances/concepts#availability-zone) you have created Instances in. All your Instances within that Availability Zone are automatically added to that default security group unless you specify a different configuration.

  </Message>

3. Click <Icon name="plus" /> (C) to launch the security group creation wizard.

4. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 

    - Choose an **Name** and description for your security group, or leave the name at the randomly generated default suggestion. 
    - Choose an **Availability Zone**, which is the geographical location in which your security group will be created. Only Instances from the same Availability Zone can be added to this security group.
    - Define the inbound and outbound **Rules** which will be applied to your security group, including whether you wish to enable SMTP ports. See [How to choose security group settings](/compute/instances/how-to/use-security-groups#how-to-choose-security-group-settings) for more information.
    - Select the **Instances** you wish to add to the security group.

5. Click **Create a new security group** to finish. Your security group is created and you are redirected to the Security Groups tab where it now appears.

## How to edit a security group

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Instances dashboard displays.

2. Click the **Security Groups** tab. The Security Groups dashboard displays.

3. Click the security group you want to edit. Alternatively, click the <Icon name="more" /> icon to the right of the security group in question, and select **More info**. Either way, you are taken to the dashboard for that security group.

4. Navigate to the required tab depending on the edit you want to make:

On the **Overview** tab, you can:
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-security-group-overview.png" alt="" />

- set/unset this security group as the project default (A)
- enable/disable SMTP for outgoing emails (B)
- enable/disable stateful group rules (C)
- delete the security group (D)

On the **Instances** tab, you can:
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-security-group-instances.png" alt="" />

- link Instances to this security group, using the dropdown menu (A)
- unlink Instances from the security group, using the <Icon name="unlink"/> button (B)

On the **Rules** tab, you can:
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-security-group-rules.png" alt="" />

- set default inbound and outbound policies, by clicking <Icon name="edit"/> (A) and then choosing **drop** or **accept** for inbound and outbound traffic.
- create, edit or delete rules to drop or incoming traffic from defined sources:
  - click <Icon name="edit"/>  (B)
  - click the **Add inbound rule** or **Add outbound rule** buttons that appear
  - create your rule and click <Icon name="validate"/>  when you have finished to confirm the new rule.
  
  See [How to choose security group settings](/compute/instances/how-to/use-security-groups#how-to-choose-security-group-settings) for more information on these choices.

## How to choose security group settings

### Enabling SMTP
By default, SMTP ports are blocked for security reasons to prevent email spam. This means that you cannot send outgoing emails from the Instance. We recommend leaving this default setting unless you specifically need to send emails from your Instance. 

To enable or disable SMTP for a security group, follow the instructions for [how to edit a security group](/compute/instances/how-to/use-security-groups/#how-to-edit-a-security-group) and check the relevant box in the **Overview** tab at step 4.

### Enabling stateful group
By default, security groups that you create are stateful. To disable or reenable stateful groups, follow the instructions for [how to edit a security group](/compute/instances/how-to/use-security-groups/#how-to-edit-a-security-group) and check the relevant box in the **Overview** tab at step 4. Note that Default Security Groups cannot be stateful.

  - **Stateless** security groups strictly apply the default policy and inbound/outbound rules, regardless of whether a connection is initiated from your Instance or not. [Read more about stateless security groups](/compute/instances/concepts#stateless-security-groups)
  - **Stateful** security groups disregard the default policy and inbound/outbound rules if a connection is initiated from your Instance. [Read more about stateful security groups](/compute/instances/concepts#stateful-security-groups)

### Setting default inbound and outbound policies
You can set default policies to drop or accept all inbound traffic, and drop or accept all outbound traffic. We recommend blocking incoming traffic by default to prevent intrusions. To change your default inbound and outbound policies, follow the instructions for [how to edit a security group](/compute/instances/how-to/use-security-groups/#how-to-edit-a-security-group), checking the relevant boxes in the **Rules** tab at step 4.

### Creating inbound and outbound rules
You can create customized inbound and outbound rules to drop or accept traffic on particular protocols, ports and IP ranges. To do so, follow the instructions for [how to edit a security group](/compute/instances/how-to/use-security-groups/#how-to-edit-a-security-group), clicking the edit icon in the **Rules tab** at step 4.

For each rule, choose the following options:
<Lightbox src="scaleway-security-group-custom-rule.png" alt="" />

- **Rule**: The value can either be **Drop** to drop connections that match the rule or **Accept** to accept these connections.
- **Protocol**: This field specifies the protocol on which the rule applies. The value can either be TCP, UDP or ICMP.
- **Port**: This field specifies the port on which the rule applies. If the **All Ports** box is checked, the rule applies to all ports.
- **IP Range**: The IP range in CIDR notation on which the rule applies.
