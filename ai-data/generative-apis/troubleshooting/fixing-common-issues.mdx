Below are common issues that you may encounter when using Generative APIs, their causes, and recommended solutions.

## 504: Timeout

### Cause
- The query is too long.
- The model goes into an infinite loop while processing the input.

### Solution
- Set a stricter **maximum token limit** to prevent overly long responses.
- Reduce the size of the input tokens, or split the input into multiple API requests.
- Use [Managed Inference](/ai-data/managed-inference/), where no query timeout is enforced.

## Structured output (e.g., JSON) is not working correctly

### Cause
- Incorrect field naming in the request, such as using `"format"` instead of the correct `"response_format"` field.
- Lack of a JSON schema, which can lead to ambiguity in the output structure.

### Solution
- Ensure the proper field `"response_format"` is used in the query.
- Provide a JSON schema in the request to guide the model's structured output.
- Refer to the [documentation on structured outputs](/ai-data/generative-apis/how-to/use-structured-outputs/) for examples and additional guidance.


## Multiple "role": "user" successive messages

### Cause
- Successive messages with `"role": "user"` are sent in the API request instead of alternating between `"role": "user"` and `"role": "assistant"`.

### Solution
- Ensure the `"messages"` array alternates between `"role": "user"` and `"role": "assistant"`.
- If multiple `"role": "user"` messages need to be sent, concatenate them into one `"role": "user"` message or intersperse them with appropriate `"role": "assistant"` responses.

#### Example error message (for Mistral models)
```json
{
  "object": "error",
  "message": "After the optional system message, conversation roles must alternate user/assistant/user/assistant/...",
  "type": "BadRequestError",
  "param": null,
  "code": 400
}
```

## Best practices for optimizing model performance

### Input size management
- Avoid overly long input sequences; break them into smaller chunks if needed.
- Use summarization techniques for large inputs to reduce token count while maintaining relevance.

### Use proper parameter configuration
- Double-check parameters like `"temperature"`, `"max_tokens"`, and `"top_p"` to ensure they align with your use case.
- For structured output, always include a `"response_format"` and, if possible, a detailed JSON schema.

### Debugging silent errors
- For cases where no explicit error is returned:
  - Verify all fields in the API request are correctly named and formatted.
  - Test the request with smaller and simpler inputs to isolate potential issues.
