This page shows you how to allow remote access to your Web Hosting databases.

By default, Web Hosting databases can only be accessed from within your hosting environment for security reasons. If you want to connect to your MySQL database remotely (for example, from your computer or a third-party server), you need to add the IP address of the device as an authorized host in cPanel.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Ordered](/webhosting/how-to/order-webhosting/) a **cPanel** Web Hosting plan
- [Created](/webhosting/how-to/manage-databases/#how-to-create-a-database) at least one database
- The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the device you want to use to connect to the database


## How to allow remote access to your Web Hosting database

1. Click **Web Hosting** in the **Domains & Web Hosting** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> and **More info**, or the domain name of the Web Hosting you want to configure. The **Hosting information** page displays.
3. Click the **Overview** tab, then click **Open hosting dashboard**. The cPanel login page displays in a new tab.
4. Log in to cPanel using your username and password.
5. In the cPanel search bar type `Remote Database Access` and click the first result that displays in the drop-down.

          Paste one of the following links into your browser if you do not know what your IP address is:
           - `ip.scw.site` to find out what your current public IP is (IPv4 or IPv6),
           - `v4.ip.scw.site` to find out what your IPv4 address is, or,
           - `v6.ip.scw.site` to find out what your IPv6 address is.
          If your device supports both IPv4 and IPv6, you can add both addresses.
    </Message>

7. Optionally, add a comment in the **Comment** field. For example you can specify who the host is (`my-computer`, `IP-address-from-work`, etc.)
8. Click **Add Host** to confirm. A green message box displays informing you that the IP address was added as a host.

      For security reasons, we recommend only adding trusted IP addresses.
