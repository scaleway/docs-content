**I**nternet **P**rotocol **V**ersion **6** is the most recent version of the IP protocol used for IP addresses. Each IPv6 address has 128 bits. Written in human-readable form, an IPv6 address can be shown as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, each group representing 16 bits and separated by a colon, e.g. `2001:0DB8:0000:0003:0000:01FF:0000:002E`. This can also be notated as `2001:DB8::3:0:1FF:0:2E`. The Scaleway Dedibox network is IPv6 compatible. IPv6 can be used as the main IP of your server, and also as an [IP failover](/dedibox-network/ip-failover/concepts/#failover-ips) using the principle of [virtual MAC](/dedibox-network/ip-failover/concepts/#virtual-mac-address).

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net)
  - You have [created](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/order-a-server) a Dedibox dedicated server

<Message type="note">
  You need to have at least one Dedibox dedicated server to order an IPv6 prefix.

## How to request a IPv6 prefix

All Scaleway Dedibox dedicated servers support IPv6. You can request a free /48 IPv6 prefix for your account. This prefix can then be divided into multiple /56 or /64 subnets. IPv6 is available for Dedibox servers in Paris and Warsaw. 

1. Click **Server** > **Network configuration** in the Dedibox console. The network configuration page displays. 
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Order a free /48 IPv6 block**.

    The IPv6 prefix will be delivered within 30 minutes and will be visible on the network configuration page. 

<Message type="important">
  The DUID of your prefix (and each of its subnets) is like a private key and grants you access to your prefix. Keep it secret and do not share it.

## How to enable IPv6 SLAAC 

Activation of IPv6 SLAAC assigns **one** `/128` IPv6 subnet to your server (one usable IPv6 address). This IP will be statically linked to your server and can not be attributed to another server.

<Message tyoe="note">
  This feature is not yet available for all servers. Only the servers that are compatible will show the related button.
</Message>

1. Click **Server** > **Server list** to display a list of all your servers.
2. Click **Manage** next to the server you want to configure. The server's status page displays.
3. Scroll down to the server's network section and click **Activate IPv6 SLAAC**.

    Your server's IPv6 SLAAC is activated now and displays in the network section. 

### How to configure the DHCPv6 client

1. Log into your server using SSH. 
2. Open the file `/etc/dhcp/dhclient6.conf` in a text editor, for example: `nano`, and edit it as shown below:
    ```
    interface "eno1" {
        send dhcp6.client-id DUID;
    }
    ```

    Make sure to adapt the interface name (`eno1`) to the Internet interface name of your system and replace `DUID` with the DUID of your subnet. 

### How to autostart the DHCPv6 client during system boot 

To enable automatic start of the DHCPv6 client during system boot, a SystemD service is required. 

1. Log into your server using SSH. 
2. Open the file `/etc/systemd/system/dhclient.service` in a text editor, for example: `nano`, and edit it as shown below:
    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=dhclient for sending DUID IPv6
    After=network-online.target
    Wants=network-online.target

    [Service]
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=10
    Type=forking
    ExecStart=/sbin/dhclient -cf /etc/dhcp/dhclient6.conf -6 -P -v eno1
    ExecStop=/sbin/dhclient -x -pf /var/run/dhclient6.pid

    [Install]
    WantedBy=network.target
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      The path to the `dhclient` binary may vary depending on your OS. To see the exact path for your system, use the following command: `which dhclient`.
    </Message>
3. Enable the service so it will start at each reboot of the machine:
    ```
    sudo systemctl enable dhclient.service
    ```
