## Extension best practices

- When you use functions installed by postgres extensions, the best practice is to specify the namespace of the function if you do not modify the `search_path`. When functions come from extensions or are used in postgresql objects, it is necessary to specify the namespace of these functions independently of `search_path` management to avoid errors when restoring backups.

## Extension usage example

For example, if the `unaccent` extension is installed in a public schema and the `search_path` is not set to public, you should run the following function instead of running `SELECT unaccent('a')`:

```
SELECT public.unaccent('a')
```

Likewise, when the view is restored from a database backup, you can use the following function to avoid an error:

```
CREATE VIEW myview AS SELECT public.unaccent(mycolumn) from mytable;
```
