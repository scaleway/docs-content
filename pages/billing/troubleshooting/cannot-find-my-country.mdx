You tried to create an account or update your billing address, but can't find your country on the list.

### Cause
Due to regulatory and legal restrictions, it is currently not possible to create a Scaleway account if you reside in one of the following countries:

- Afghanistan;
- Belarus;
- Burundi;
- Central African Republic;
- Cuba;
- Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea);
- Crimea;

Note that this applies to any address update. If you were previously located in a supported locality and plan on relocating to one of the countries listed above, it will not be possible to update your postal address.
