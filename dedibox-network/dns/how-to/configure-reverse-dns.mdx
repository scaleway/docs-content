Reverse DNS is the opposite of classic "forward" DNS, and maps an IP address to a hostname. This can be useful if, for example, you want to send emails from your server. If you are using the default reverse (`*.poneytelecom.eu`), you may experience problems with deliverability of your mails and during the subscription of certain tools like [JMRP](https://postmaster.live.com/snds/JMRP.aspx).

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net)
  - You created a corresponding A record for your reverse DNS at least 24 hours ago
</Message>

1. From the [console](https://console.online.net), click **Server** in the top menu, then select **Server list**.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-dedibox-server-list.webp" alt="" />
2. Click **Manage** next to the relevant server.
3. Under **Network**, click **Edit Reverses**.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-edit-reverse-button.webp" alt="" />
4. Enter the new reverse DNS of your IP (generally this corresponds to your hostname) and click **Update**.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-edit-reverse-panel.webp" alt="" />

    Your reverse DNS is now updated.
