This page shows you how to create a Slack app, a Slack webhook, and a Slack integration in Grafana using the Scaleway Alerting and the Grafana alert managers, and how to configure notification policies to receive your Grafana alert notifications to your Slack channel.

3. Enter a name for your app. For the purpose of this documentation, we are naming the app `Grafana alerts`.
4. Pick the workspace you want to receive alerts in from the drop-down.
5. Click **Create App** to confirm. You app's **Basic information** page displays.
6. Optionally, scroll down to **Display information** to customize the way your app will display in Slack. For example, you can:

4. Click the drop-down and select one or all Slack channels.
5. Click **Allow**.
6. Click **Copy** under the **Webhook URL** section, as you will need it in the next steps.

12. Click **Save contact point**.

    <Message type="important">
     If you have already created contact points, you need to [configure a nested notification policy](#configuring-a-notification-policy) to define which contact point should receive which alert.

## Configuring a notification policy

If you have created multiple contact points in Grafana, the default contact point will receive alerts by default. To make sure your alerts are sent to the desired contact point, you need to define notification policies.

1. [Access](/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards/) your Grafana dashboard.
2. Click the **Toggle menu** icon next to **Home** in the top left corner of your screen.
3. Click **Alerting**, then click **Notification policies**.
4. Click **+ New nested policy**.
5. In the **Label** field, enter the label `alertname`.
6. In the **Operator** field, select **Equals**.
7. In the **Value** field, enter the name of an existing alert you want your contact point to be notified for. For example, `alert-for-high-cpu-usage`.
8. Optionally, click **+Add matcher** to add more labels.
9. In the **Contact point** field, select the contact point you have configured for Slack.
10. Click **Save policy**. Your nested policy displays. You should now get notified on Slack.
