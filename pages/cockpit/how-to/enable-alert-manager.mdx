This page shows you how to enable Scaleway's regionalized alert manager, add and manage contacts that will be notified when your alerts are triggered, using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/).

You can add or manage contacts at any time to ensure the right people are notified when alerts fire.

<Requirements />

  - A Scaleway account logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to enable the alert manager

Enabling Scaleway's regionalized alert manager allows you configure preconfigured alerts for your Scaleway resources.

1. Click **Cockpit** in the **Monitoring** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Cockpit** overview page displays.
2. Click the **Alerts** tab.
3. Click the **Region** drop-down and select the desired region.
      <Message type="important">
        Make sure that you select the same region as the [data sources](/cockpit/concepts/#data-sources) you want to be alerted for.
      </Message>
4. Click **Enable alert manager** under the **Alert manager** section. A pop-up displays prompting you to configure alert notifications.
    <Message type="tip">
      Configuring alert notifications consists of two steps:
      - Enabling the alert manager, and
      - Adding contacts
      This allows the contacts to receive notifications whenever alerts you have configured are triggered.
    </Message>
5. Click **Enable alert manager** to confirm. The step for adding contacts displays.
6. Enter an email address, then click **+ Add email** and **Add contacts**. Your email address displays in the **Contacts** section, and by default, the **Resolved notifications** box is ticked. This means that you will receive notifications for resolved alerts.
7. Optionally, click **Skip for now** if you do not want to add contacts yet.
    <Message type="note">
     You are prompted to create contacts when enabling the alert manager for the first time, or when re-enabling it after disabling. However, you can also add or manage them independently from the alert manager configuration at any time.
    </Message>

## How to add contacts

You are prompted to create contacts when [enabling the alert manager](/cockpit/how-to/enable-alert-manager/) for the first time, or when re-enabling it after disabling. However, you can also perform this step independently from the alert manager configuration at any time.

1. Click **Cockpit** in the **Monitoring** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Cockpit** overview page displays.
2. Click the **Alerts** tab.
3. Click the **Region** drop-down and select the desired region.
    <Message type="important">
     Make sure that you select the same region as the [data sources](/cockpit/concepts/#data-sources) you want your contacts to be alerted for.
    </Message>
4. Click **Add email** in the **Contacts** section. A pop-up displays.
5. Enter an email address, then click **+ Add email**. Your email address displays and by default, the **Resolved notifications** checkbox is ticked. This means that you will receive notifications for resolved alerts.
6. Optionally, enter another email and click **+ Add email** to add another contact.
7. Click **Add contacts** to confirm. The email addresses appears in the list of your contacts.

Refer to the dedicated documentation to find out how to manage your contacts.

## How to manage contacts

1. Click **Cockpit** in the **Monitoring** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Cockpit** overview page displays.
2. Click the **Alerts** tab.
3. Click the **Region** drop-down and select the desired region.
    <Message type="important">
     Make sure that you select the same region as the [data sources](/cockpit/concepts/#data-sources) you want your contacts to be alerted for.
    </Message>
4. Scroll to the **Contacts** section and:
  - click **Send test alert** to ensure that your alerts are sent to your contacts. You **must have [activated preconfigured alerts](/cockpit/how-to/activate-managed-alerts/)** beforehand.
  - clear the checkbox under **Resolved notifications** to **stop receiving resolved notifications**.
  - click the trash icon next to the contact you wish to **delete**, then click **Delete contact** to confirm.
    <Message type="important">
     The contact you delete will no longer receive alerts. If this is your only configured contact, alert notifications will stop until you add a new contact.
