7. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click **Order**.
8. If you didn't select hosting backup, a pop-up may display asking you to confirm your choice. Click **Continue without backup** or **Add backup**. The **Contact information** page displays.
9. Complete the contact information for the domain name.
    <Message type = "important">
      You must always keep the domain owner's contact details accurate and up to date. If you wish to change details pertaining to the identity of the owner (full name(s) of a natural person or corporate name for a legal entity) this must be done by the [change of owner / applicant](/dedibox-console/domains/how-to/change-ownership) process via the relevant page of the [console](https://console.online.net/fr/domain/trade).

10. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click **Confirm**. The **Summary** page displays.
11. Check the summary of your order and select a payment mode from the drop-down menu. You must also agree to the terms of service as well as the web hosting specific terms, and choose whether to activate automatic renewal of your domain.
12. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click **Confirm my command**. You are redirected to the payment gateway to complete your payment.
    <Message type="note">
      You will generally receive one or more emails to confirm the transfer. However, since the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force, it is possible that the process will be completed without the use of email. This depends on your registrar and registry. If you receive no e-mail, the transfer will be validated after 14 days.
