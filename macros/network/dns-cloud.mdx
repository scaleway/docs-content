The **D**omain **N**ame **S**ystem (DNS) is a name management system for computing devices connected to a network, be it public (Internet) or private. It translates text-based [domain names](/network/domains-and-dns/concepts/#domain-name) to numerical [IP addresses](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#ip-address). Scaleway provides a [managed DNS](/network/domains-and-dns/concepts/#scaleway-domains-and-dns) service.
