In this tutorial, you will learn how to get started with Cockpit using a Terraform configuration file containing all the code you need to create:

- A [Grafana user](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#grafana-users)
- A folder in the Grafana user interface
- A Cockpit [token](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#tokens) with permission to query and push metrics
- A metric [data source](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#data-sources)

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Configured an SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/#how-to-generate-an-ed25519-ssh-key-pair-on-macos-and-linux)
- [Installed Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html/) on your local machine


## Configuring your environment

### Clone the repository

Open a terminal on your local machine and clone the `cockpit-terraform` repository containing the Terraform configuration file:

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:scaleway/cockpit-terraform.git
    ```

### Add your information

1. Access the `main.tf` file inside the `cockpit-terraform` directory. We recommend that you do it manually, as you need to add your values.
2. Replace `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` line 5, with your Scaleway Project ID.
3. Replace `your-grafana-user` line 28, with a name for the [Grafana user](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#grafana-users) you will be creating.
4. Replace `Test Folder` line 39, with a name of your choice.
5. Replace `your-push-token` line 45, with a name for your Cockpit token.
6. Replace `your-data-source` line 57, with a name for your [metric](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#metric) data source.
7. Save your changes and close the file.

## Build and deploy your infrastructure

1. Open a terminal and access the `cockpit-terraform` file:

    ```
    cd cockpit-terraform
    ```
2. Run the following command to download the dependencies and initialize Terraform:

    ```
     terraform init
    ```
3. Run the following command to deploy your infrastructure. Terraform generates an execution plan showing you what actions are about to be performed.

    ```
     terraform apply
    ```

    ```
    Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan.
    Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
      + create

    Terraform will perform the following actions:

      # grafana_folder.folder_test will be created
      + resource "grafana_folder" "folder_test" {
          + id                           = (known after apply)

        }

      # scaleway_cockpit_source.main will be created
      + resource "scaleway_cockpit_source" "main" {
          + created_at                = (known after apply)

          + type                      = "metrics"
          + updated_at                = (known after apply)
          + url                       = (known after apply)
        }

      # scaleway_cockpit_token.main will be created
      + resource "scaleway_cockpit_token" "main" {
          + created_at = (known after apply)
          + id         = (known after apply)
          + name       = "your-push-token"
          + project_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
          + region     = (known after apply)
          + secret_key = (sensitive value)
          + updated_at = (known after apply)

          + scopes {
              + query_logs          = false
              + query_metrics       = true
              + query_traces        = false
              + setup_alerts        = false
              + setup_logs_rules    = false
              + setup_metrics_rules = false
              + write_logs          = false

            }
        }

    Plan: 5 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

    Do you want to perform these actions?
      Terraform will perform the actions described above.
      Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.
    ```
4. Type `yes` and Enter to apply the changes. An output similar to the following displays:

    ```
    Apply complete! Resources: 4 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

    Outputs:

    cockpit_url = "https://xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.dashboard.obs.fr-par.scw.cloud"
    cockpit_user_login = "your-grafana-user"
    cockpit_user_password = "your-grafana-user-password"
    ```

    <Message type="important">
      We recommend that you store your Grafana user password displayed in the output in a safe place so you do not lose it.

2. Click the **Grafana users** tab. Your newly created user displays.
3. Click **Open dashboards** in the top right-hand corner.
4. Log in to Grafana using your Grafana credentials. The **Cockpit Dashboards** page displays.
5. Click **Toggle menu** in the top left-hand corner, then click **Dashboards**. Your newly created folder displays.
6. Click **Toggle menu** in the top left-hand corner, then click **Connections**.
7. Click **Data sources**. Your metrics data source displays. You can now push your data into it, and [build a dashboard](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/getting-started/build-first-dashboard/) to visualize your metrics.
