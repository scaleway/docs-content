## Problem
You are unable to connect to your Scaleway Elastic Metal server using remote access (KVM over IP).

### Symptoms
- The remote access session does not start or remains stuck.
- You see a black screen or no video output.
- Keyboard and mouse inputs are unresponsive.
- The KVM session disconnects frequently.
- Error messages appear when launching the remote console.

## Possible causes
- The remote access feature is not properly activated.
- Network issues preventing KVM connection.
- Browser or Java compatibility problems.
- The server is in an unresponsive state.

## Solution

#### Ensure remote access is enabled
- Log in to the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) and navigate to your Elastic Metal server.
- Confirm that the **remote access* feature is available for your machine and activated.
- If not enabled, follow our [instructions on how to activate remote access](/elastic-metal/how-to/activate-remote-access/) to activate it.

#### Check network and firewall settings
- Ensure that your local network does not block KVM over IP connections.
- Try using a different network or disable VPNs that may interfere.
- Allow the necessary ports for remote access in your firewall settings.

#### Try a different browser or system
- Some remote access solutions require specific browsers or Java versions.
- Try launching the KVM session in a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- Prefer using the HTML5 remote console over the Java version (if available).
- Ensure that [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) is updated and enabled if required.

#### Restart the remote access session
- Close any existing remote access session and relaunch it from the Scaleway console.
- If the session remains unresponsive, try rebooting your server.

#### Check server status
- If your server is unresponsive, attempt a soft reboot from the Scaleway console.
- If that does not work, use the power cycle option to restart the machine.

#### Contact Scaleway support
If remote access is still unavailable, contact [technical support](https://console.scaleway.com/support) with:
  - Your server ID and IP address.
  - Screenshots of any error messages.
  - Details of the browser and system used for the connection.
