Once your [cluster is created](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/), a `.kubeconfig` file is available for download to manage several Kubernetes clusters. You can use this with `kubectl`, the Kubernetes command line tool, allowing you to run commands against your Kubernetes clusters. You can use `kubectl` from a terminal on your local computer to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created a [Kubernetes Kapsule cluster](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/)

1. [Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) on your local computer.
2. Download the `.kubeconfig` files from your cluster's **overview** page:

3. Configure access to your cluster. You can do this in one of two ways:

    Set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable:
    ```
    export KUBECONFIG=/$HOME/Downloads/Kubeconfig-ClusterName.yaml
    ```

    Or use `use $HOME/.kube/config file`:
    ```
    mv $HOME/Downloads/Kubeconfig-ClusterName.yaml $HOME/.kube/config
    ```

    Either way, make sure you replace `/$HOME/Downloads/Kubeconfig-ClusterName.yaml` with the correct name and path of your downloaded `.kubeconfig` file.
4. Run the following command to finish:
    ```
    kubectl get nodes
    ```
