excerpt: |
  A simple solution to begin with Object Storage is to use the S3cmd tool, which is a client for S3 Object Storage.
  S3cmd allows you to create, list and delete buckets, download, upload, and delete objects inside the Object Storage.
  Object Storage allows you to store any kind of object (documents, images, videos, etc.) and retrieve them at a later time from anywhere.

## Using Object Storage with s3cmd

Learn how to use s3cmd with Object Storage by following this tutorial.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have generated [your API key](/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key/)

</Message>

Object Storage allows you to store any kind of objects (documents, images, videos, etc.).
You can retrieve them anytime and from anywhere.

For instance, you can store images and they will be accessible using HTTP.
You can use the control panel to manage your storage.
As the our API is S3 compatible, a lot of tools exist to interact with the object storage.

This tutorial details how to use the Object Storage with s3cmd.

## Retrieving your Credentials

To access Objectt Storage using s3md, you require your [API key](/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key/).

## Downloading S3cmd

A simple solution to begin with Object Storage is to use the S3cmd tool, which is a client for S3 Object Storage.

S3cmd allows you to create, list and delete buckets, download, upload, and delete objects inside the Object Storage.
Download S3cmd [S3cmd](https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd) on github.

If you use Linux or OS X, your package manager probably has a package for s3cmd.

<Message type="important">

Make sure you have at least the version 2.0 (`s3cmd --version`). Upgrade `s3cmd` if it is not the case. Previous versions might not work properly.

</Message>

## Configuring S3cmd

1. In a terminal, create a file named `.s3cfg` in your home directory.

2. Replace `access_key = <ACCESS_KEY TO INSERT HERE>` and `secret_key = <SECRET_KEY TO INSERT HERE>` with your credentials.
  ```sh
  [default]

  # Object Storage Region NL-AMS

  host_base = s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud
  host_bucket = %(bucket)s.s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud
  bucket_location = nl-ams
  use_https = True

  # Login credentials

  access_key = <ACCESS_KEY TO INSERT HERE>
  secret_key = <SECRET_KEY TO INSERT HERE>
  ```
  <Message type="tip">

  Alternatively you can also use the configuration file generator by running `s3cmd --configure` to generate a configuration file.

  </Message>

### Using Multiple Configuration Files

It is possible to configure s3cmd to use different configuration files on the same computer to manage buckets in multiple regions.

1. Create a default configuration file as indicated in the [previous step](#configuring-s3cmd).

2. In a terminal, create a new file named `.s3cfg-fr-par` in your home directory.

3. Replace `access_key = <ACCESS_KEY TO INSERT HERE>` and `secret_key = <SECRET_KEY TO INSERT HERE>` with your credentials.
  ```sh
  [default]
  signature = s3v4

  # Object Storage Region FR-PAR

  bucket_location = fr-par
  host_base = https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud
  host_bucket = https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud

  # Login credentials

  access_key = <ACCESS_KEY TO INSERT HERE>
  secret_key = <SECRET_KEY TO INSERT HERE>
  ```

4. Use s3cmd by specifying the new configuration file in the command:
  ```
  s3cmd ls -c ~/.s3cfg-fr-par
  ```

## Using Object Storage with S3cmd

### Creating a new bucket

The following command creates a bucket to store objects with S3cmd.
A bucket name must contain only alphanumeric and lowercase characters.

```sh
john@localhost:~$ s3cmd mb s3://mynewbucket

Bucket 's3://mynewbucket/' created
```


### Uploading objects into the bucket

The following command uploads `movie1.avi` and `photo1.jpg` into the bucket `mynewbucket`:

```sh
john@localhost:~$ s3cmd put movie1.avi photo1.jpg s3://mynewbucket

movie1.avi -> s3://mynewbucket/movie1.avi [1 of 2]
0 of 0 0% in 0s 0.00 B/s done
photo1.jpg -> s3://mynewbucket/photo1.jpg [2 of 2]
0 of 0 0% in 0s 0.00 B/s done
```

<Message type="important">

When uploading files from a Scaleway Compute Instance an error message may appear. Your file will be uploaded and you can ignore this message:

```
ERROR: Cannot retrieve any response status before encountering an EPIPE or ECONNRESET exception
WARNING: Upload failed: /bucket_name?partNumber=1&uploadId=ZWY5ZWRhNzItMjE3NS00ZTY4LWFkOTMtYTFhODRkYTRkNzdl ([Errno 32] Broken pipe)
```
We are currently working to avoid this behaviour.

</Message>

### Listing objects inside a bucket

The following command lists the objects inside a bucket:

```sh
john@localhost:~$ s3cmd ls s3://mynewbucket

2014-09-10 08:44 0 s3://mynewbucket/movie1.avi
2014-09-10 08:44 0 s3://mynewbucket/photo1.jpg
```

### Downloading an object from a bucket

The following command downloads the object `movie1.avi` locally:

```sh
john@localhost:~$ s3cmd get s3://mynewbucket/movie1.avi movie1.avi

s3://mynewbucket/movie1.avi -> movie.avi [1 of 1]
0 of 0 0% in 0s 0.00 B/s done
```

### Removing objects from a bucket

The following command removes the object `movie1.avi` from the bucket `mynewbucket`:

```sh
john@localhost:~$ s3cmd del s3://mynewbucket/movie1.avi

File s3://mynewbucket/movie1.avi deleted
```

### Removing a bucket

The following command removes the bucket `mynewbucket`:

```sh
john@localhost:~$ s3cmd rb s3://mynewbucket

Bucket 's3://mynewbucket/' removed
```

## Configuring CORS

### Setting a CORS configuration on a bucket

1. Create a [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) configuration file and open it in a text editor:
  ```
  nano cors.xml
  ```

2. Put your configuration in the file, save it and exit the editor:
  ```
  <CORSConfiguration>
    <CORSRule>
      <AllowedOrigin>http://www.example.com</AllowedOrigin>
      <AllowedMethod>PUT</AllowedMethod>
      <AllowedMethod>POST</AllowedMethod>
      <AllowedMethod>DELETE</AllowedMethod>
      <AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
      <MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
      <ExposeHeader>x-server-side-encryption</ExposeHeader>
    </CORSRule>
  </CORSConfiguration>
  ```

3. Set the information on the bucket:
  ```
  s3cmd setcors cors.xml s3://bucketname
  ```

### Deleting the CORS configuration of a bucket

To delete the CORS configuration of a bucket, run the following command:
  ```
  s3cmd delcors s3://bucketname
  ```

  <Message type="important"> 

  It is currently not possible to get the CORS configuration of a bucket with `s3cmd`. It is recommended to use [aws-cli](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-operations/#get-bucket-cors) to get the CORS settings of a bucket.

## Getting further

For more information about the different s3cmd commands, refer to the official documentation by running `s3cmd --help`.
