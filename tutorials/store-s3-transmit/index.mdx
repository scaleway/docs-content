## Transmit 5 - Overview 

Object Storage allows you to store any kind of object (documents, images, videos, etc.) and retrieve them at a later time from anywhere.

For instance, you can store images and they will be accessible using HTTPS.
You can use the control panel to manage your storage. Some tools exist to interact with Object Storage.

## Configuring Transmit

1. Open the application. On the right hand side you see the remote server list.

2. Click `+` to create a new server profile.

3. Choose **Amazon S3** in the list of service types and name the profile. Confirm by clicking **Next**:
<Lightbox src="scaleway-transmit-00.webp" alt="" />

4. Enter the following information in the form and **Save** it:
    - **Address:** `s3.REGION.scw.cloud`
    - **Port:** `443`
    - **Access Key ID:** your Access key
    - **Secret:** your Secret key
    - **Root URL:** `https://s3.REGION.scw.cloud`

    <Message type="important">

    Edit the **Address** and **Root URL** parameters to the region of your bucket. It can either be `fr-par` (Paris, France), `nl-ams` (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) or `pl-waw`(Warsaw, Poland).

    </Message>

5. Log in to the server:

<Lightbox src="scaleway-transmit-02.webp" alt="" />

You can now create a bucket and store objects inside.
A bucket name must contain only alphanumeric and lowercase characters.
