This page shows you how to set up [SPF](/transactional-email/concepts/#spf-record) and [DKIM](/transactional-email/concepts/#dkim-record) records to your domain to verify it.

After you have configured your domain with Transactional Email, you are prompted to verify your domain by adding [SPF](/transactional-email/concepts/#spf-record), [DKIM](/transactional-email/concepts/#dkim-record), [DMARC](/transactional-email/how-to/add-dmarc-record) and [MX](/transactional-email/concepts/#mx-record). You can choose to do so right after you have validated your domain, or at a later time.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A domain name
- [Configured your domain with Transactional Email](/transactional-email/how-to/configure-domain-with-transactional-email/)

1. Click **Transactional Email** in the **Domains & Web Hosting** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. Your newly-added domain displays.
2. Click your domain. You are redirected to the SPF, DKIM, DMARC and MX configuration page.
3. Copy the value that applies to your case to add an SPF record.
    <Message type="important">
     - If you have no SPF record on this domain, copy the following value: `v=spf1 include:_spf.tem.scaleway.com -all`
     - If you already have configured an SPF record, copy the following value: `include:_spf.tem.scaleway.com`
    </Message>

4. Add a `TXT` record type in the root zone of your domain on your DNS zone.
5. Paste the value you have copied in the root zone of your domain.
6. Add an additional `TXT` record type in the root zone of your domain on your DNS zone.
7. Copy the name that displays in the console.

10. Add an [MX record](/transactional-email/how-to/add-mx-record-to-your-domain/).
11. Check the box "I have added these DNS records to my DNS zone" to confirm.
12. Click **Verify domain**. Your domain displays in the list of your domains.
