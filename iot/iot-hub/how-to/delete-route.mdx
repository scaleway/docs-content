Routes allow your IoT Hub to forward messages to non-MQTT destinations.

Currently the following routes are available:

 - **REST route** allowing you to call a REST API with the content of your messages.
 - **Database route** allowing you execute queries on a PostgreSQL or MySQL database with the content of your messages.
 - **Scaleway Object Storage route** allowing you to store your messages in your Scaleway [Object Storage](https://www.scaleway.com/en/object-storage/) bucket.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have [created an IoT Hub](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/create-hub)
- You have created at least one IoT Hub route
