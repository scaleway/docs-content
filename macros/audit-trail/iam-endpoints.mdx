  ## IAM

  ### IAM supported endpoints

    The following IAM endpoints are supported and will be logged in Audit Trail:

    - CreateSSHKey (`POST /iam/v1alpha1/ssh-keys`)
    - UpdateSSHKey (`PATCH /iam/v1alpha1/ssh-keys/{ssh_key_id}`)
    - DeleteSSHKey (`DELETE /iam/v1alpha1/ssh-keys/{ssh_key_id}`)

    ### Additional information

    - When a Scaleway Organization is created, default policies and groups are automatically generated. These actions are logged in Audit Trail.
    - Invitations to join a Scaleway Organization expire after seven days. On day seven, the user is removed, and this action is logged in Audit Trail.
