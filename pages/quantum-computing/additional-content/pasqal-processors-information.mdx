Scaleway provides access to Pasqal's "Fresnel" generation devices and their digital twins.

## Hardware & Emulator
* **Fresnel (100+ Qubits):** The QPU allows you to trap and control over 100 atoms. It exploits the **Rydberg blockade** mechanism to create entanglement between atoms.
* **Locations:** We provide access to two geographically distinct units:
    * `QPU-FRESNEL-100PQ-FR` (Located in France)
    * `QPU-FRESNEL-100PQ-CA` (Located in Canada)
    * *Note: Both devices offer similar specifications.*
* **Emulator:** `EMU-FRESNEL-100PQ` is a high-performance digital twin running on A100 GPU cluster. It simulates the physics of the Fresnel device to validate your pulse sequences before running on real hardware.

## Pulser: The native SDK

To program neutral atoms, you don't typically use "Gates" (like CNOT or Hadamard) as the primary abstraction. Instead, you define **Pulse Sequences** using **Pulser**, Pasqal's open-source Python SDK.

**Pulser allows you to:**
* **Define the register:** Place your atoms at specific coordinates.
* **Design the sequence:** Define the laser pulses (amplitude, detuning, phase) applied to the atoms over time.
* **Execute:** Run the sequence locally or remotely.

On Scaleway QaaS, the integration is handled by the `pulser-scaleway` package, which acts as a remote backend for your sequences.
