**Commitment Plan for Apple silicon** is a flexible pricing option that allows you to choose between a fully flexible pay-as-you-go pricing or a long-term monthly commitment period for their Apple silicon servers.
By committing to a plan, you can enjoy better rates compared to pay-as-you-go pricing.

The initial commitment is for one month from the order of the server. At the end of your initial commitment period, the commitment is automatically renewed every month on the anniversary date, unless you choose to delete the machine, in which case the deletion will take effect on the anniversary date of the commitment. 

It is important to note that the commitment concerns the server and it's associated options (such as the VPC option), which also have lower prices with monthly billing.

  Currently, it is not possible to switch from a monthly commitment to hourly billing.

    - No commitment: You can terminate the subscription of your Mac mini at any time after the initial 24 hours, which is a mandatory period required by Apple's software license.

    - Commitment: You subscribe to a [Commitment Plan for Apple silicon](/apple-silicon/concepts/#commitment-plan) and benefit from a discounted monthly price depending on your commitment. The commitment period can be chosen at the time of creation or later, but it is automatically renewed every month on the anniversary date.
