The Private Network feature of the managed Load Balancers product lets you attach your Load Balancer to up to eight different Private Networks. [Scaleway Private Networks](/network/vpc/concepts/#private-networks) allow your cloud resources to communicate in an isolated and secure network. Load Balancers using Private Networks can communicate with their backend servers without using the public Internet. The feature supports both static IP and DHCP configuration for the Load Balancer IP in each Private Network.

[Private Load Balancers](/network/load-balancer/concepts/#private-load-balancer) must be connected to a Private Network in order to be functional, as they do not have a public IP address and can only receive requests from other resources on the Private Network. This is in contrast to public Load Balancers, which are accessible for requests via the internet through their public IP address, but can optionally use Private Networks to communicate with their backend servers. The procedure for attaching either a public or a private Load Balancer to a Private Network is the same, and described below.

## How to attach a Private Network to your Load Balancer

1. Click [Load Balancers](https://console.scaleway.com/load-balancer/lbs) in the **Network** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The Load Balancer dashboard displays.
2. Click on the Load Balancer that you want to add to a Private Network. The Load Balancer's overview page displays.
3.  Click the **Private Networks** tab.
4. Click **Attach to a Private Network**. A pop-up displays.
5. Select whether to attach to a new Private Network, or an existing one, then choose the IP configuration for your Load Balancer. You can choose either dynamic configuration using DHCP, or static IP configuration. 

    With dynamic configuration, a DHCP server in your Private Network will automatically assign the IP configuration to your Load Balancers. When using static configuration, you can manually assign an IP address from your network's IP subnet to the Load Balancer. 
6. Click **Attach to Private Network** to validate the form. The Private Network is attached to the Load Balancer and displays in the **Private Network** tab. Its private IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on the network are also visible, if you activated DHCP.

    To attach several Private Networks to your Load Balancer, repeat the steps above for each of them.

    For more information on Private Networks, see our [dedicated documentation](/network/vpc/concepts/#private-networks).

## How to detach a Private Network from your Load Balancer

1. Click [Load Balancers](https://console.scaleway.com/load-balancer/lbs) in the **Network** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The Load Balancer overview page displays. 
2. Click on the Load Balancer that you want to detach from a Private Network.
3. Click the **Private Networks** tab. The list of Private Networks attached to your Load Balancer displays.
4. Click the <Icon name="unlink" /> button next to the Private Network that you want to detach from the Load Balancer.

The Private Network is detached from the Load Balancer, and disappears from the **Private Network** tab.
