A Project can only be deleted once it has been emptied of its [resources](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#resource). To effectively delete your Project, you must therefore **empty its resources first**.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created a Project](/console/my-project/how-to/create-a-project) other than the [default Project](/console/my-project/concepts/#default-project)
  - The Project you want to delete has been emptied of its resources.
</Message>

1. Click **Project Dashboard** in the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu.
2. Click the **Settings** tab.
3. Scroll down to find the **Delete Project** section.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-delete-project.webp" alt="" />
4. Click **Delete Project**. A pop-up appears requesting you to confirm that you want to delete the selected Project.
    <Message type="important">
     If your project contains existing ressources, a list of said resources appears. You must delete each resource before continuing, as only empty project can be deleted. <br /><br />
     The default project cannot be deleted.
    </Message>

    <Message type="tip">
      Alternatively, you can:
      - Go to your Organization dashboard.
      - Go to the **Projects** tab.
      - Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Delete** next to the name of the Project you want to delete.
    </Message>
5. Click **Delete Project** to confirm. You are redirected to the Default Project dashboard.
