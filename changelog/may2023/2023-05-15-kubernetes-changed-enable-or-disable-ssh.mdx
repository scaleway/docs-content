Kubernetes Kapsule nodes come now pre-installed with an SSH server that a security group protects. This SSH server is intended solely for debugging purposes. To activate or deactivate the SSH server on your nodes, refer to the [documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/containers/kubernetes/how-to/enable-disable-ssh/) for detailed instructions.
