## Account access and security

### My account is locked. What do I do?
If your account is locked, [contact our support team](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create) to learn the reason for the blockage and discover how to regain access.

### I've been invited to an Organization, but can’t see any resources
When you create a Scaleway account after being invited to join a specific Organization as a [Guest](/iam/concepts/#guest), a personal Organization is automatically created for you.

If you only want to work on the Project you have been invited to, you can switch Organizations and Projects using the drop-down menu on the console dashboard.

### I cannot access my account but I am still being billed

First you must contact the support to help you [unlock your account](/account/troubleshooting/cannot-log-into-my-account/). Once you have regained access, identify what resources are still running and delete them. You can also [close your account](/account/how-to/close-account), and have all your remaining resources automatically shutdown.

### Can I reopen a closed account?
Yes, you can [reopen a closed account](/account/how-to/close-account/#how-to-reopen-your-account). However, a closed account's resources are permanently deleted, and you cannot retrieve them.

### How can I report spam content that I received?
You can report spam easily by installing the Signal Spam plugin, which is available for web browsers, email clients, and iOS devices. The plugin, represented by an owl-shaped button, allows you to flag unwanted emails or malicious URLs (such as phishing or scams) directly from your inbox.

When you report spam, your information is processed in real-time and shared with authorized entities that can take appropriate actions, such as identifying spammers, enforcing legal measures, and blacklisting harmful URLs. While Signal Spam does not filter emails or act as an antivirus, your reports help improve security measures and contribute to a safer online environment.

To get started, install the [plugin](https://www.signal-spam.fr/en/nos-modules/) (available for Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera browsers and Mac Mail, Outlook, and Thunderbird mail clients) or follow the official reporting path at [Signal Spam](https://www.signal-spam.fr/en/parcours-signalant/) for further support.

## Account management

### Can I change my Organization’s country?
If you need to change your Organization country and region, you must [create a support ticket](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create).

To make the process faster, when creating your ticket, inform us of your Organization’s new address, including: street address, city, postal code, region, and country.

### Can I change the name of my Organization?
If you have a Corporate, Startup, or Consultant account, you need to [create a support ticket](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create) to change your Organization’s name. If you have a Personal project account type, you can change your Organization’s name in the [Organization settings](https://console.scaleway.com/organization/settings). It may take a few minutes for the new name to be fully updated across the console.

### How do I delete my Organization?
[Closing your account](/account/how-to/close-account/#how-to-close-your-account) permanently deletes your Organization, along with its servers, resources, services, and backups.

<Message type="note">
  We recommend that you delete all resources before closing your account. Otherwise, the remaining resources will be billed for usage before their manual deletion, which can take up to 10 days.
</Message>

### I would like to delete my personal data
Refer to the [How to delete your account and personal data](/account/how-to/close-account/) documentation.

<Message type="note">
  Once you request the deletion of your account and personal data, you will no longer be able to access your account or invoices. The request will take at least 72 hours to be processed. You must make sure all your bills are paid, and that you have not used any resources since the beginning of the current calendar month.
</Message>

### Where can I find my Organization ID?
You can find your Organization ID by accessing the [Settings](https://console.scaleway.com/organization/settings) page of your Organization dashboard.

You can also click the **Copy ID** button next to the Organization name to do so.

### How do I change my email address?
To change your email address:

1. On the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com), go to your [profile](https://console.scaleway.com/account/profile).
2. Under the section **User information**, click **Edit profile**.
3. Enter a new address under **Email address**, then click **Confirm changes** to save your modification.
4. Confirm your new email address by clicking the link sent to your inbox.

## Projects and resource management

### Can I move a Project to another account?
At this moment, it is not possible to move a Project from one account to another.

### I have created a resource in the wrong Project. Can I move it?
At this moment, it is not possible to move a resource from one Project to another.
If you need to move a resource, you must delete it and create it again in the right Project.

### How can I get more quotas?
You can get more quotas by adding and verifying your [payment method](/billing/how-to/add-payment-method/) and [identity](/account/how-to/verify-identity/).

If you have already completed these two steps and still need an increase in quotas, contact our [support team](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create) and inform them which product you need more quotas for.

### I don’t seem to have access to my Organization's resources
If you do not have access to certain Organization resources, you might not have the necessary [IAM](/iam/concepts/#iam) **permission set**.

[Read the documentation on permission sets](/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/)​ to learn more about the different access levels.

Contact an Organization owner or a member with the necessary permissions to request rights to the resources you require access to.

## Support

### What is my current support plan?
You can find your support plan on [the support plan page within the Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/support/plans). The free, Basic support plan is included for all Scaleway customers automatically.

### How can I change my current support plan?
You can [change your support plan](/account/how-to/configure-support-plans/) on the support plan page via the Scaleway console.

### How frequently can I change my plan?
You can switch plans once a month.

### I would like to upgrade my plan to get faster responses. Once I upgrade, how soon will I receive the benefits of my new plan?
When you change your plan, the upgrade is applied immediately.

### If I upgrade my support plan in the middle of the month, how will I be billed?
You will be billed on a pro rata basis. For example, if you switch from the Silver plan to the Gold plan on the 20th of the month, you will be billed from the first to the 19th for the Silver plan. Starting from the 20th until the end of the month, you will be charged for the Gold plan.

### How do the Advanced, Business and Enterprise support plans pricing work?

When you subscribe to a support plan (besides Basic), you either pay a set monthly fee, or a percentage of your net spend.

This means your support plan fees depend on how much you spend per month. You will pay whichever fee out of the two is the greater.

To determine your monthly payment, calculate the percentage of your monthly spend. If the result is:
    - Less than the fixed monthly fee, you will pay the fixed price.
    - Equal to or higher than the fixed price, you will pay a percentage of your net monthly spend.

The fixed monthly fees and the percentages vary according to your support plan:

| Plan            | Fixed monthly fee     | Percentage of net spend     |
| :--------------------------: | :----------------: | :----------------:  |
| **Advanced**        | €50         | 5%   |
| **Business**        | €250          |  10%  |
| **Enterprise**        | €999         |  20%  |

For example, with the:
    - **Advanced plan**:
        - If you spend €1,000 in a month, then 5% of €1,000 = €50. In this case, €100 is less than €250, so you will pay the fixed price of €250.
        - If you spend €5,000 in a month, then 10% of €5,000 = €500. In this case €500 is higher than €250, so you will pay the price of 500€ for the month.
    - **Business plan**:
        - If you spend €1,000 in a month, then 10% of €1,000 = €100. In this case, €100 is less than €250, so you will pay the fixed price of €250.
        - If you spend €5,000 in a month, then 10% of €5,000 = €500. In this case €500 is higher than €250, so you will pay the price of 500€ for the month.

### Which language does the support team speak?
Our support team can assist you in English and French, via ticket and/or phone, depending on your support plan level.
