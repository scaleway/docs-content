Once you have a Dedibox server, have installed an OS and connected via SSH you are ready to get started using it. This document gives you some tips and hints about the basics.

## How to use the shell

By default, there is no graphical desktop available on a server. Instead, you run all commands in text mode in a shell/terminal. The shell is very powerful. It allows you to carry out a huge range of actions, including installing, configuring and using software, creating, editing and deleting files and folders, and configuring your machine. You can [connect to the shell via SSH](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/connect-to-server/#how-to-connect-via-ssh)

The most basic commands required for using your server via the shell can be found in our [basic Linux commands](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/reference-content/basic-linux-commands/) tutorial.

## How to use a graphical desktop

If you prefer a graphical desktop on your Dedibox, you can install one of our Desktop orientated distributions and connect to the server using the X2Go Client. Refer to our documentation to [connect via Windows Remote Desktop](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/connect-to-server/#how-to-connect-via-remote-desktop)

## How to install software (Linux OSes)

After you create and install your Dedibox, only an SSH server and an operating system are installed on the server. A package manager will help you install and manage software on your server. There are several package managers available, depending on your distribution.

  - On Debian/Ubuntu, the package manager is called APT. See our documentation on getting started with the APT package manager [here](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/manage-packages/).
  - On CentOS/RedHat, the package manager is called YUM.
  - On SuSE Linux, the package manager is called YAST.

You can use package managers to install, update and delete software directly from the shell.

## How to back up your Dedibox 

You are responsible for the data on your server. Therefore, we recommend making regular backups. Each Dedibox can order a Dedibackup option, with different disk sizes. Dedibackup gives you secure FTP storage where you can keep your backups. You can also automatize your backups, with tools like Backup Manager.
