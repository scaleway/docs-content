This page shows you how to configure alerts for Scaleway resources that are not integrated into Cockpit using the [Mimir](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#mimir) alert manager. As Grafana's alert manager does not run indefinitely, we recommend using Mimir's alert manager to receive alerts on your resources.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
  - You have [activated your Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/how-to/activate-cockpit/)
  - You have created Scaleway resources to monitor
  - You have [created your Grafana credentials](/observability/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/) and selected the **Editor** role
  - You have [activated managed alerts and created at least one contact point](/observability/cockpit/how-to/activate-managed-alerts/)
