Default Instance images for Ubuntu, Debian, and CentOS support auto-configuration of interfaces plugged into a Private Network.

They leverage helper scripts provided by the `scaleway-ecosystem` package. These scripts:

- Enable DHCP on the interfaces plugged into a Private Network
- When Instances are attached to Private Networks plugged into Public Gateways, make the default route received by DHCP the primary route for all traffic on the Instance
- Keep the route to the Scaleway Metadata API more specific (see below).

If your Instance does not get auto-configured, it may be that you are using an old version of the `scaleway-ecosyste`m package. `scaleway-ecosystem` version 0.0.4 or later is required. Use the following command to update it:

- On Ubuntu (Focal and Jammy) or Debian (Stretch and Buster):

    ```bash
    add-apt-repository ppa:scaleway/stable && apt update && apt install scaleway-ecosystem
    add-apt-repository ppa:scaleway/stable && apt update && apt install scaleway-ecosystem
    apt list scaleway-ecosystem
    ```

- On Debian distributions (Bookworm, Bullseye and Buster):

    ```bash
    cat << EOF > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/scaleway-ubuntu-debian-stable-jammy.list
    deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/scaleway/debian-stable/ubuntu jammy main
    # deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/scaleway/debian-stable/ubuntu jammy main
    EOF
    apt -y update
    apt install scaleway-ecosystem
    apt list scaleway-ecosystem
    ```

- On CentOS 7:

    ```bash
    yum -y install yum-plugin-copr
    yum -y copr enable @scaleway/instances
    yum -y install scaleway-ecosystem
    ```

- On Centos Stream 8 and later, RockyLinux, AlmaLinux, or Fedora:

    ```bash
    dnf -y copr enable @scaleway/ecosystem
    dnf -y install scaleway-ecosystem
    ```

These scripts register a custom `SystemD` unit named `scw-vpc-iface` that seamlessly configures the Instance's IPs for all the Private Networks it is a part of. Your own unit services may need to [depend on this unit.](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html#Wants=)
