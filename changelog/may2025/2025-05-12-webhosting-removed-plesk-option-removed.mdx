To streamline our Web Hosting offer, the Plesk option has been removed for new orders. Existing web hostings with Plesk remain fully functional and supported. However, we encourage users to explore alternative solutions available in the [Scaleway console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elementswebhosting) for new deployments.
