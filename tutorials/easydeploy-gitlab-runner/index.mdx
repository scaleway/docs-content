GitLab Runner is a powerful tool that executes CI/CD jobs in GitLab.
When hosted on Kubernetes, it leverages the scalability and resilience of container orchestration to efficiently manage and run your pipelines.
By deploying GitLab Runner on a Kubernetes cluster, you can dynamically scale the number of runners based on demand, ensure high availability, and seamlessly integrate with your existing Kubernetes infrastructure.
This setup enables you to optimize resource utilization, reduce overhead, and enhance the performance of your continuous integration and deployment processes.

<Macro id="requirements" />
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner/) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission/) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
- Created a Scaleway Kubernetes [Kapsule](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/) or [Kosmos](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-kosmos-cluster/) cluster
- A GitLab repository

## Deploying the GitLab Runner application using Easy Deploy

1. In the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/), navigate to the **Kubernetes** section under **Containers**.
2. Click the name of the cluster where you wish to deploy GitLab Runner. The **Cluster Information** tab will display.
3. Click the **Easy Deploy** tab. The application dashboard displays.
4. Click **Deploy Application**. The application deployment wizard displays.
5. Choose **Application Library** to see the list of available applications.
6. Select the **GitLab Runner** application.

        If you cannot find GitLab Runner on the first page, use the search bar or navigate through the library using the arrow buttons.
    </Message>
7. Optionally, customize the default configuration for GitLab Runner using [Helm Charts](/tutorials/kubernetes-package-management-helm/). If you do not need any customized configuration you can skip this step.
8. Enter a name (e.g. `gitlab-runner`) and a Kubernetes namespace for your application. If no name is entered, GitLab Runner will be installed in the default namespace of the cluster.
9. Click **Deploy Application** to deploy GitLab Runner on your Kubernetes cluster.
10. Verify that the GitLab Runner is successfully installed and running:
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n default # replace "default" with the name of the Kubernetes namespace in which you have installed your GitLab Runner.
    ```
    You should see a pod with a name similar to `gitlab-runner-xxxxxx-xxxxx` in the `Running` state.

## Configuring a GitLab CI/CD pipeline to use your Kubernetes Runner

  If you do not have a GitLab repository yet, you can deploy a [GitLab server using Easy Deploy](/tutorials/gitlab-server/) on your Kubernetes cluster.

### Register the GitLab Runner with GitLab

Before your GitLab Runner can start executing jobs from your GitLab repository, it needs to be registered with your GitLab server, as shown below:

1. Obtain the GitLab Runner Registration Token:
   - Go to your GitLab project.
   - Navigate to **Settings** > **CI/CD** > **Runners**.
   - Under the **Specific Runners** section, you will see the registration token.

2. Register the GitLab Runner:
   - Connect to your Kubernetes cluster where the GitLab Runner is deployed.
   - Use the following command to start the registration process:
     ```bash
     kubectl exec -it <gitlab-runner-pod-name> -- gitlab-runner register
     ```
   - When prompted, enter the following details:
     - **GitLab instance URL:** The URL of your GitLab server (e.g., `https://gitlab.com` or your self-hosted GitLab URL).
     - **Registration Token:** The token you obtained in the previous step.
     - **Description:** A description for this runner (e.g., `k8s-runner`).
     - **Tags:** Tags for the runner (e.g., `k8s-runner`). These tags should match the tags specified in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
     - **Executor:** Select `kubernetes` as the executor.

### Verify Runner registration

After registering the runner, verify that it is correctly registered and active:

1. In your GitLab project, navigate to **Settings** > **CI/CD** > **Runners**.
2. You should see your newly registered runner listed under the **Specific Runners** section.

### Configure the GitLab CI/CD pipeline

1. Create/Edit the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:
    - Ensure your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file includes jobs with tags that match your runner’s tags. Refer to the configuration example below to picture what your file should look like:
    ```yaml
    stages:
      - build
      - test

    build:
      stage: build
      script:
        - echo "Building the project..."
        - # Add your build steps here
      tags:
        - k8s-runner

    test:
      stage: test
      script:
        - echo "Running tests..."
        - # Add your test steps here
      tags:
        - k8s-runner
    ```

2. Push the configuration to GitLab:
    - Push your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to your GitLab repository:
    ```bash
    git add .gitlab-ci.yml
    git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline configuration"
    git push origin main
    ```

### Monitor the pipeline

Navigate to **CI/CD** > **Pipelines** in your GitLab project to view the status of your pipeline.

<Message type="tip">
  If the pipeline fails, you can check the logs of the GitLab Runner pod for more information:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n default <gitlab-runner-pod-name>
   ```
</Message>

# Conclusion

You have successfully set up a GitLab Runner hosted on Kubernetes and configured your GitLab CI/CD pipeline to use it. This setup allows you to leverage the scalability and flexibility of Kubernetes for your CI/CD workflows.

For more detailed information on configuring your GitLab Runner, refer to the [official GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/kubernetes.html#configuring-gitlab-runner-using-the-helm-chart/).
