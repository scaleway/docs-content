When you [order an Elastic Metal server](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/create-server/), you can see the estimated impact of your Elastic Metal server of choice before you order. In this page we explain how the estimation is measured.

<Message type="note">
  The estimation described on this page is based on the calculation methodology detailed in the [Environmental Footprint calculation breakdown](/environmental-footprint/environmental-footprint/additional-content/environmental-footprint-calculator) documentation page.

## Availability Zone footprint estimation

When you select the Availability Zone of your Elastic Metal, you can see the indication of quantity of CO2e emitted per kW consumed per zone.

This data is determined by the [PUE]() of the datacenter and the [energy mix](#energy-mix) of the country in which the datacenter is located.

<Message type="note">
  We use [Ember's](https://ember-climate.org/) Electricity Data Explorer to determine the impact linked to the energy mix. You can also refer to [Electricity Maps' Environmental Impact by Zone map](https://app.electricitymaps.com/map) for a visual representation of the energy mix of each region, including France, Poland, and the Netherlands.

A data at the offer level, which is an estimate of the environmental impact for the use of this offer for 1 hour or 1 month depending on the billing method chosen (as is done for the price). This data is different for each offer but also for each DC (the same offer will not have the same impact on par2 as on waw2). This estimate takes into account the impact of the manufacturing and use of all the elements that make the service work (see documentation on the calculation methodology). This figure is only an estimate because the server's power consumption will depend on the use made of it. We make this estimate based on internal tests where the server is tested according to different configurations and where the DC power consumption is measured (see https://confluence.infra.online.net/display/HDS/Qualification+-+Power+Tests, internal documentation that explains the tests carried out by the hardware team).
A recap that recalls the environmental impact estimate at the end of the page
It is important to specify that the data at the AZ level are not added to the offer data, but are an indication that will make it possible to evaluate the impact of the power consumption which is then integrated into the calculation of the impact of the offer.

Whether for AZ or Offers, the data is represented in the form of a sheet (three sheets for the greenest, 1 sheet for the least green) in order to easily see the best choices from an environmental impact point of view. It is also possible to display the exact data when hovering over the map with your mouse.
