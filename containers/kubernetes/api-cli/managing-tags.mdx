<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/) a Scaleway Kubernetes cluster
</Message>

The Scaleway Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) will also synchronize the tags of Scaleway Instances to Kubernetes Labels on the nodes.

<Message type="note">
  When using Scaleway's managed Kubernetes, Kapsule, the tags on the pool will be transformed into tags on the pool's Instances, so applying to all Kubernetes nodes of the pool.
  This also works on Kosmos Scaleway pools, but not on `multi-cloud pool`, nor external nodes.

## Labels

In order for a tag to be synced to a label, it needs to be of the form `foo=bar`.
In this case, the Kubernetes nodes will have the label `k8s.scaleway.com/foo=bar`.

Once the tag is removed from the Instance, it will also be removed as a label on the node.

### Non prefixed labels

It is possible to add labels not prefixed with `k8s.scaleway.com`. The downside is that deleting the associated tag does not remove the label.
In order to have non prefixed labels, you should prefix the tag with `noprefix=`.

For instance, the tag `noprefix=foo=bar` will yield the `foo=bar` label on the Kubernetes nodes.

This is the only way to add custom prefixed labels like `node.kubernetes.io`.

## Taints

In order for a tag to be synced to a taint, it needs to be of the form `taint=foo=bar:Effect`, where `Effect` is one of `NoExecute`, `NoSchedule` or `PreferNoSchedule`.
In this case, the Kubernetes nodes will have the taint `k8s.scaleway.com/foo=bar` with the effect `Effect`.

Once the tag is removed from the instance, it will also be removed as a taint on the node.

### Non prefixed Taints

It is possible to add taints not prefixed with `k8s.scaleway.com`. The downside is that deleting the associated tag does not remove the taint.
In order to have non prefixed taints, you should prefix the taint with `taint=noprefix=`.

For instance, the tag `taint=noprefix=foo=bar:Effect` will yield the `foo=bar` taint on the Kubernetes nodes with the `Effect` effect.

This is the only way to add custom prefixed taints like `node.kubernetes.io`.

## Special Kubernetes labels

- `node.kubernetes.io/exclude-from-external-load-balancers` can be set on the Kubernetes nodes if this same value is set as a tag on the Instance. It will have the value `managed-by-scaleway-ccm` and will be deleted if deleted from the tags.
