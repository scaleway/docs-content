[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is a mature and advanced open-source relational database system. With more than 30 years of active development, the software has earned a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

It runs on all major operating systems, including Linux, different Unix variants, MacOS X and Windows. This tutorial describes how to run it on an Ubuntu based server.

## Installing PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL provides an APT mirror with the latest builds of the software.

Add the Postgres mirror, update the APT packet cache and install the required packages:

```
apt-get install wget ca-certificates
wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -
sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
apt-get install postgresql-10 postgresql-contrib
```

## Using PostgreSQL Roles and Databases

Postgres uses a concept similar to regular Unix-style accounts, called **roles**. However Postgres does not distinguish between users and groups and uses the more flexible term role.

By default Postgres is configured to use ident authentication, which means matching a role with a Unix/Linux system account

If a role exists in Postgres a system user with the same name is able to sign in as that role.

During the installation a user called `postgres` has been created and is used to log into that account having the default Postgres role.

### Logging into PostgreSQL from the postgres Account

It is possible to login from the postgres account by using an intermediate bash.

Switch into the postgres account:

```
sudo -i -u postgres
```
 
To access the command prompt, type:

```
psql
```

To exit the prompt, type:

```
\q
```

## Creating New Roles

By default, only the **postgres** role is configured within the database. Adding of new roles can be done with the command `createrole`.

When you are logged as the **postgres** user, launch the command as following:

```
createuser --interactive
```

You will be asked to enter the name of the new role and some additional questions:

```
root@pgsql:~# sudo -u postgres createuser --interactive
Enter name of role to add: bill
Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) n
Shall the new role be allowed to create databases? (y/n) y
Shall the new role be allowed to create more new roles? (y/n) n
```

More information about the usage of the `createuser` command is available in the [official documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/static/app-createuser.html).

## Creating New Databases

The authentication system of Postgres assumes by default that a database exists with the same name as the role .

This means if you have created a role **bill** in the previous step, Postgres will by attempt by default to connect to a database bill.

When you are logged directly as the postgres user, run the following command:

```
createdb bill
```

For more information, you may consult the [official documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/static/app-createdb.html).

## Connecting to a Postgres Prompt with the new Role

The `ident` based authentication requires a matching Linux user with the same name as the Postgres role and database. If it does not exist yet, create the user with the following command:

```
sudo adduser bill
```

If the previous steps have been followed, login now into the database with the following command:

```
sudo -u bill psql
```

## Creating and Querying Databases

To understand the basic SQL syntax, we create a phonebook that contains a user personal details:

1. Connect to the Postgres prompt.

2. Create a new table called phonebook, that contains fields for the phone number, first and last name and the city:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE phonebook(phone VARCHAR(32), firstname VARCHAR(32), lastname VARCHAR(32), city VARCHAR(64));
  ```

3. Insert data into the table. You may repeat this command if you want to add more than one set of data:

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO phonebook(phone, firstname, lastname, city) VALUES('+33 1 23 45 67 89', 'Paul', 'Smith', 'Paris, FR');
  ```

4. Select data from the table. Run the following command to retrieve all data sets, sorted by the lastname

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM phonebook ORDER BY lastname;
  ```

  This will give you an result like the following:

  ```sql
  bill=# SELECT * FROM phonebook ORDER BY lastname;
        phone       | firstname | lastname |     city
  -------------------+-----------+----------+---------------
  +33 1 23 45 67 89 | Paul      | Smith    | Paris, FR
  +33 9 87 65 43 21 | Jessica   | White    | Marseille, FR
  (2 rows)
  ```

  To retrieve all entries in the phonebook where the family name is Smith, run:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM phonebook WHERE lastname = 'Smith';
  ```

  You will get an result as the following:

  ```sql
  bill=# SELECT * FROM phonebook WHERE lastname = 'Smith';
        phone       | firstname | lastname |   city
  -------------------+-----------+----------+-----------
  +33 1 23 45 67 89 | Paul      | Smith    | Paris, FR
  (1 row)
  ```

5. Update the city of a user:

  ```sql
  UPDATE phonebook SET city = 'London, UK', phone = '+44 7123 456789' WHERE firstname = 'Paul' AND lastname = 'Smith';
  ```

6. Delete the data of a user:

  ```sql
  DELETE FROM phonebook WHERE firstname = 'Paul' AND lastname = 'Smith';
  ```
