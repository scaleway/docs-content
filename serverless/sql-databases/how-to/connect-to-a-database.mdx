This page shows you how to set up the connection to a Serverless SQL Database using the Scaleway console.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [signed up to the private beta](https://www.scaleway.com/en/betas/#serverless-db) and received a confirmation email.
  - You have created a [Serverless SQL Database](/serverless/sql-databases/how-to/create-a-database/)
</Message>

## How to set up credentials

1. From the **Overview** tab of your database, click the **Set up credentials** button. The setup wizard displays.

2. Select the [principal](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#principal) to connect to the database:
    - Yourself, as an [IAM user](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#user).
    - An [application](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#application) that you [previously created](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-application/) in the IAM section of the console.
    <Message type="note">
        Refer to the [IAM documentation](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/overview/) for more information on identities and access rights.
    </Message>
3. Set up the **connection string** or **connection parameters**:
    - If you already have a secret key, replace the `[INSERT_SECRET_KEY_HERE]` placeholder with your key.
    - If you do not have a secret key, click **Generate new secret key**.
4. Copy your connection string or parameters and store them securely.

## How to connect to a database as a user

1. Run the following command in a terminal:

    ```bash
    psql "[YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING]"
    ```

    An output similar to the following response displays:

    ```bash
    psql (15.3, server 14.8 (Debian 14.8-1pgsg120+1))
    SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, compression: off)
    Type "help" for help.
    ```

2. Run the following command to see the version of your Serverless SQL Database:

    ```
    SELECT version();
    ```

    An output similar to the following displays:

    ```
    PostgreSQL 14.8 (Debian 14.8-1.pgdg120+1) on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu,
    compiled by gcc (Debian 12.2.0-14) 12.2.0, 64-bit
    ```

3. Press `q` to quit the version overview.

You can now perform the authorized actions in the database.

## How to connect an application to a database

Use the connection parameters (host, port, user, password, database name) previously saved to connect your application to the database.
