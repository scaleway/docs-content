Starting **October 15th, 2025**, Cockpit will be integrated with **Scaleway IAM**, allowing you to authenticate to your Cockpit's Grafana using your **Scaleway credentials** instead of Grafana credentials.

This page explains how to prepare for the transition.


## Reasons for the change

We are simplifying authentication and improving security by:

- Removing the need to manage Grafana-specific users and passwords.
- Enabling login using your existing **Scaleway credentials**.
- Allowing central IAM-based access management.
- Supporting **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.

## Transition timeline

| Event | Date |
|------|------|
| IAM authentication becomes available | **October 15th, 2025** |
| Creating new Grafana users disabled | **October 15th, 2025** |
| Legacy Grafana user login deprecation | **January 20th, 2026** |

Grafana users not linked to Scaleway IAM will be deprecated. Refer to the table below to find out until when you can perform which actions.

| Action | Available until |
|--------|-----------------|
| Logging in using Grafana user credentials | **January 20th, 2026** |
| Generate passwords for existing Grafana users | **January 20th, 2026** |
| Create new Grafana users | **Disabled after October 15th, 2025** |

## What is changing?

### New login method

From **October 15th**, you will be able to log in using your Scaleway credentials via the Scaleway console or saved links.

### New dashboard URLs

To support both login methods during the transition, Grafana dashboards will have a **new URL**:

- **Old URL:**
  `https://<project_id>.dashboard.obs.fr-par.scw.cloud`

- **New URL (IAM-authenticated):**
  `https://<project_id>.dashboard.cockpit.scaleway.com`


Both links will be functional until **January 20th, 2026**, after which only the new IAM-based URLs will remain valid.

## Who can access your Cockpit's Grafana?

Users must:

- Be **Members** of your Scaleway Organization
- Have access to the Scaleway Project where the Cockpit is located
- Have been granted either the `ObservabilityReadOnly`, the `AllProductsFullAccess`, or the `ObservabilityFullAccess` IAM permission set

You can manage Members and permission sets in the [IAM section of the Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/members).

    <Message type="tip">
     Make sure that you review and manage permissions sets granted to current Members of your Organization, to either revoke or grant access accordingly.

## How to access your Cockpit's Grafana

### From the Scaleway console

Access to Grafana using the Scaleway console remains the same as before.

1. Click **Cockpit** in the **Monitoring** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Cockpit** overview page displays.
2. Click **Open dashboards** to open your preconfigured dashboards in Grafana. You will be automatically logged in using your Scaleway account.

### From a saved/shared link

You can also access your Cockpit's Grafana using bookmarked links if you cannot access the Scaleway console.

1. Open the new IAM-compatible URL. The Scaleway login page displays.
2. Log in using your Scaleway credentials. Your Grafana dashboard displays.

## How to prepare for this transition

1. Make sure that you review and manage permissions sets granted to current Members of your Organization, to either revoke or grant access accordingly.

    If you have Grafana users who are not in your Scaleway Organization:

2. [Invite them as Members](/iam/how-to/manage-members/#how-to-create-a-member) to your Organization.
3. Assign the `ObservabilityReadOnly` or the `ObservabilityFullAccess` permission sets only to the Projects they need to access.
