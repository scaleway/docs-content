You can delete an Edge Services pipeline at any time by following the steps below.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An Edge Services pipeline

1. Click **Edge Services** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Pipelines** tab displays.

2. Click the pipeline that you want to delete. You are taken to the pipeline's **Overview** page

4. In the **Delete Edge Services pipeline** panel at the bottom of the screen, click **Delete Edge Services pipeline**.

    A pop-up displays, asking you to confirm that you want to delete the pipeline.
      - The Load Balancer/Object Storage bucket will no longer be accessible via its Edge Services endpoint, or any customized domains pointing to this endpoint.
      - Any files stored in the Edge Services cache will be removed.
    
    <Message type="tip">
    Remember to:
      - Delete any CNAME records created for this pipeline from your domain provider, unless your domain is managed with Scaleway Domains and DNS, in which case we take care of deletion for you.
      - Delete any SSL/TLS certificates you imported into Secret Manager for this pipeline (if no longer required elsewhere), so that you are no longer billed for them. If you generated a managed Let's Encrypt certificate however, Scaleway takes care of the deletion for you.

5. Click **Confirm**.

    The Edge Services pipeline is deleted. You can create a new pipeline for this origin at any time, but you will need to reconfigure your custom domain, and the cache will initially be empty.
