Learn how to install and configure OpenVPN on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with this comprehensive guide. Follow our step-by-step instructions to establish a secure VPN connection via your Scaleway Instance with ease.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An [Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) running on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

## Installing OpenVPN and Easy-RSA

1. Connect to your Instance via SSH.
   ```sh
   root@<YOUR_INSTANCE_IP>
   ```
2. Update the package list and upgrade already installed packages:
   ```sh
   apt update
   apt upgrade -y
   ```
3. Install OpenVPN and Easy-RSA using `apt`:
   ```sh
   apt install -y openvpn easy-rsa
   ```

## Setting up the Certificate Authority (CA)

1. Create a directory for Easy-RSA and navigate to it:
   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/openvpn-ca
   cd ~/openvpn-ca
   ```
2. Initialize the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI):
   ```sh
   cp -r /usr/share/easy-rsa/* /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/
   cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/
   ./easyrsa init-pki
   ```
3. Build the Certificate Authority (CA):

   ```sh
   ./easyrsa build-ca
   ```
   You will be prompted to set a passphrase and provide a Common Name (e.g., "OpenVPN-CA").

## Generating server and client certificates

1. Generate the server certificate and key:
   ```sh
   ./easyrsa gen-req server nopass
   ./easyrsa sign-req server server
   ```
   Approve the signing request when prompted.
2. Generate Diffie-Hellman parameters:
   ```sh
   ./easyrsa gen-dh
   ```
3. Generate a shared secret for additional security:
   ```sh
   openvpn --genkey secret /etc/openvpn/ta.key
   ```

## Configuring the OpenVPN Server

1. Copy the necessary files to the OpenVPN directory:
   ```sh
   cp pki/ca.crt pki/private/server.key pki/issued/server.crt /etc/openvpn/
   cp /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/dh.pem /etc/openvpn/
   cp /etc/openvpn/ta.key /etc/openvpn/
   ```
2. Create the OpenVPN server configuration file:
   ```sh
   nano /etc/openvpn/server.conf
   ```
3. Add the following configuration:
   ```
   port 1194
   proto udp
   dev tun
   ca ca.crt
   cert server.crt
   key server.key
   dh dh.pem
   auth SHA256
   tls-auth ta.key 0
   server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0
   ifconfig-pool-persist ipp.txt
   push "redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp"
   push "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.8.8"
   push "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.4.4"
   keepalive 10 120
   cipher AES-256-GCM
   user nobody
   group nogroup
   persist-key
   persist-tun
   status openvpn-status.log
   log-append /var/log/openvpn.log
   verb 3
   ```
   Save and exit the editor.

## Enabling IP forwarding and configuring the firewall

1. Enable IP forwarding:
   ```sh
   echo 'net.ipv4.ip_forward=1' | tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
   sysctl -p
   ```
2. Configure the firewall ([UFW](/tutorials/installation-uncomplicated-firewall/)):
   ```sh
   ufw allow 1194/udp
   ufw allow OpenSSH
   ```
3. Edit the UFW configuration to allow forwarding:
   ```sh
   nano /etc/ufw/before.rules
   ```
4. Add the following lines before the `*filter` line:
   ```
   *nat
   :POSTROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]
   -A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
   COMMIT
   ```
5. Save and exit, then reload UFW:
   ```sh
   ufw disable
   ufw enable
   ```

## Starting the OpenVPN server

1. Start and enable the OpenVPN service:
   ```sh
   systemctl start openvpn@server
   systemctl enable openvpn@server
   ```
2. Check the status of the OpenVPN service:

   ```sh
   systemctl status openvpn@server
   ```
   Ensure it is active and running.

## Generating client configuration

1. Generate client certificates:

   ```sh
   cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/
   ./easyrsa gen-req client1 nopass
   ./easyrsa sign-req client client1
   ```
   Approve the signing request when prompted.

2. Create the client configuration file:
   On your server, create a new client configuration file named `client1.ovpn`:
   ```sh
   nano ~/client1.ovpn
   ```
3. Add the following configuration in the file, replacing `your_server_ip_or_domain` with your server's IP address or domain name:
   ```
   client
   dev tun
   proto udp
   remote your_server_ip_or_domain 1194
   resolv-retry infinite
   nobind
   persist-key
   persist-tun
   remote-cert-tls server
   auth SHA256
   cipher AES-256-GCM
   verb 3
   <ca>
   -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
   # Insert the content of /etc/openvpn/ca.crt here
   -----END CERTIFICATE-----
   </ca>
   <cert>
   -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
   # Insert the content of /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/issued/client1.crt here
   -----END CERTIFICATE-----
   </cert>
   <key>
   -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
   # Insert the content of /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/private/client1.key here
   -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
   </key>
   <tls-auth>
   -----BEGIN OpenVPN Static key V1-----
   # Insert the content of /etc/openvpn/ta.key here
   -----END OpenVPN Static key V1-----
   </tls-auth>
   key-direction 1
   ```
   <Message type="note">
   Replace the placeholder text (e.g., `# Insert the content of /etc/openvpn/ca.crt here`) with the actual contents of the respective files. You can use the `cat` command to display the contents of each file and then copy and paste them into the appropriate sections of the `client1.ovpn` file.
    - For example:
      ```sh
      cat /etc/openvpn/ca.crt
      ```
   Copy the output and paste it between the `<ca>` and `</ca>` tags in the `client1.ovpn` file.
   </Message>

4. Transfer the client configuration file to the client device:
   Use a secure method to transfer the `client1.ovpn` file to the device you intend to use as a client. You can use `scp` (secure copy) for this purpose:
   ```sh
   scp ~/client1.ovpn user@client_device_ip:/path/to/destination/
   ```
   Replace `user` with your username on the client device, `client_device_ip` with the client's IP address, and `/path/to/destination/` with the desired directory on the client device.
5. Install OpenVPN on the client device:
   Ensure that the OpenVPN client is installed on your client device. Installation methods vary depending on the operating system:

   - **Linux:**
     ```sh
     apt update
     apt install -y openvpn
     ```

   - **Windows:**

     Download and install the OpenVPN client from the [official website](https://openvpn.net/community-downloads/).

   - **macOS:**

     Download and install [Tunnelblick](https://tunnelblick.net/), a free OpenVPN client for macOS.

6. Connect to the VPN:

   - **Linux:**

     Use the following command to start the VPN connection:
     ```sh
     openvpn --config /path/to/client1.ovpn
     ```

   - **Windows/macOS:**

     Import the `client1.ovpn` file into your OpenVPN client application and initiate the connection through the application's interface.

7. Verify the connection:
   Once connected, verify that your public IP address matches the VPN server's IP address, indicating that your internet traffic is being routed through the VPN. You can check your public IP address by visiting [WhatIsMyIP.com](https://www.whatismyip.com/) or a similar service.

Your OpenVPN server is now configured on your Ubuntu 24.04 LTS instance, and your client device is set up to connect securely.

## Maintenance

For ongoing maintenance, remember to renew your Let's Encrypt certificates regularly (they expire every 90 days). You can automate this process with a cron job:
```sh
echo "0 0 1 */2 * certbot renew --quiet" | tee -a /etc/crontab
```
This cron job runs the `certbot renew` command on the first day of every second month at midnight.
