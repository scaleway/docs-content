This page explains how to secure your function.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created a functions namespace](/serverless/functions/how-to/create-a-functions-namespace/)
  - You have [created a Function](/serverless/functions/how-to/create-a-function/)

## Use Secrets to store access keys and sensitive information

Instead of using environment variables (which are stored in clear text) for your functions, use Secrets. These are pieces of information that can be used via environment variables, but are encrypted in storage.

<Message type="tip">
    You can [create an API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) and store it with Secrets to grant your functions access to the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/)
</Message>

### Configure Secrets from the Scaleway console

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.
2. Click the relevant function namespace.
3. Click the name of the function for which you want to define Secrets.
4. Click the **Settings** tab.
5. Scroll to the **Secrets** section of the page and click **Add new secret**. Enter the key and value for your Secret. Repeat for additional secrets.
    <Message type="important">
        Be careful when you type your Secrets. You will not be able to read the value in the console once submitted.
    </Message>
6. Click **Save settings** to submit your secrets and redeploy your function.

### Configure Secrets using the Serverless framework

Add `secret` to your function's description (more information in the [plugin documentation](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-scaleway-functions#security-and-secret-management)).
We recommend using them with global environment variables or a `.env` file stored independently (and kept secret).

```
secret:
      secret_1: ${env:SCW_SECRET_KEY}
```
<Message type="important">
    We strongly suggest that you do not commit this in a Version Control System (VCS), and do not share your Project ID or access key. This helps to ensure the security of your configuration file, which may contain sensitive data.
</Message>

### Configure Secrets using Terraform

Add the following [resource description](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/scaleway/scaleway/latest/docs/resources/function) in Terraform:

```
secret_environment_variables = { "key" = "secret" }
```

## Restrict access to your functions

You can set Serverless Functions as private if you want to protect your functions from unwanted or unauthorized calls.
Unauthenticated calls will be rejected, and your function will not be triggered. This feature is handy if an event triggers your function (CRON, SQS or NATS trigger) or if you put them behind an API gateway or a proxy server (see examples in [serverless-examples](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-examples)).

### Restrict access from the Scaleway console

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.
2. Click the relevant function namespace.
3. Click the name of the function for which you want to define Secrets.
4. Click the **Security** tab.
5. Set the **Privacy Policy** of the function to **Private**.
6. If required, create an access token for your function:
    * Click **Generate token** in the **Tokens** section of the page. A pop-up displays.
    * Enter a description and set an optional expiration date. To generate a permanently-valid valid token tick **No expiration date**. Then click **Generate token**.
    * The token is displayed. Copy and store the token in a secure environment.
        <Message type="important">
            The token key will be shown only once. Copy and safely store it before leaving this page.
        </Message>

### Restrict access using the Serverless framework

Set `privacy: private` in your functions description.

You can generate access tokens for your function using the Scaleway console:

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.
2. Click the relevant function namespace.
3. Click the name of the function for which you want to define Secrets.
4. Click the **Security** tab.
5. Click **Generate token** in the **Tokens** section of the page. A pop-up displays.
6. Enter a description and set an optional expiration date. To generate a permanently-valid valid token, tick **No expiration date**. Then click **Generate token**.
    The token is displayed. Copy and store the token in a secure environment.
    <Message type="important">
        The token key will be shown only once. Copy and safely store it before leaving this page.
    </Message>

### Restrict access using Terraform

Set `privacy = "private"` in your Terraform [resource description](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/scaleway/scaleway/latest/docs/resources/function).

You can generate access credentials to inject in other applications (containers, functions etc.) directly from Terraform using the [function_token resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/scaleway/scaleway/latest/docs/resources/function_token)

## Set up alerts in Observability Cockpit (upcoming feature)

Using Scaleway [Observability Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/quickstart/), a managed Grafana solution to which all your functions are connected, you can:
* Monitor your functions using the default dashboard or create custom ones.
* Set up notifications to be alerted in case of unexpected behavior.
