This document covers the behavior of transitive peering when using Scaleway VPC Peering.

## Overview

Scaleway VPC Peering natively supports transitive peering relationships across chained VPCs, connected one another using peering connectors. In a setup where three VPCs A, B and C are peered in a chained manner (A ↔ B ↔ C), VPC A can communicate with VPC C via an intermediate VPC B (A ↔ B ↔ C), even though VPC A and C are not directly connected with a peering connector.

To enable transitive peering, you must create additional [custom routes](/vpc-peering/concepts/#custom-routes) in each VPC of the transitive chain, indicating the destination VPC and peering connector to use as a next hop. 

Routing complexity therefore increases with the number of chained VPCs. For this reason, transitivity is limited to 4 consecutively chained VPCs.
