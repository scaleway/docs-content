Abuse tickets are complaints regarding the use of Scaleway services for illegal behavior or hosting of illegal content. Abuses for the same issue on the same resource within a given timeframe are grouped by case.
Scaleway’s clients are responsible for taking the appropriate security measures in order to solve the case and prevent any further abuse from their resources in order to avoid the locking of their services.
However, Scaleway reserves the right to immediately suspend the infringing services if it is deemed necessary and proportionate to keep Scaleway’s network safe or to abide by legal requirements.

If you encounter any issue with the resolution of your abuse tickets, please contact the abuse team by opening a [support ticket](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create) directly from your console.

    In case you receive an abuse ticket for hosting illegal content (including copyright), please delete the content from Scaleway infrastructure promptly.
    * In case you receive an abuse ticket for hosting illegal content (including copyright), please delete the content from Scaleway infrastructure promptly. 
    * For other types of abuse, here are some suggestions to help you to correct it:
        * Backup all your server data
        * Check for recent file changes
        * Check log files on your server
        * Check your PHP and cgi files for any backdoors
        * Check if any software you use is vulnerable, and update them
        * Reinstall your server after backup
        * Change passwords of your server
        * Backup your website and your email data
        * Check for recent files changes, security holes in common CMS you may use (Joomla, SPIP, WordPress…)
        * Check version in some software you may use on your computer (email client, FTP client)
        * Change your FTP and email passwords
    If you do not know how to correct the problem, you can contact our [outsourcing partners(https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/outsourcing/)] or reach out to Scaleway’s abuse team by opening a ticket directly from your console.

4. The case will be closed at the end of its lifetime by Scaleway’s abuse team, and so will the abuse tickets forming the case.
   In case you receive further abuse tickets on the same resource within the case lifetime, it means that you did not take the appropriate measures to prevent further abuse from happening. 
   Therefore, please take additional actions and contact our support team if you need assistance. Failure to take appropriate measures to solve the case may result in the locking of your service as per our [Terms of Services](https://www.scaleway.com/en/contracts/) and the legal framework in force. 

In specific instances, the case will be closed automatically:
* abuse reports submitted by Scaleway’s abuse partners may be closed automatically after the automated locking of your service if several complaints are received within the same case or if Scaleway considers that the type of abuse reported requires the immediate locking of your service.
* cases regarding security holes will be closed automatically. Please refer to the description of the abuse in order to find more details on patches and updates available.
