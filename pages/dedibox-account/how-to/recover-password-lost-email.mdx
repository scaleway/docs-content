To ensure the security of your Scaleway Dedibox account, it is strongly advised that you regularly verify and update your contact details, especially your email address.
This precaution helps prevent potential account lockouts if you lose access to both your console password and email account.

In the unlikely event that you encounter such a situation, follow these steps to recover access to your Scaleway Dedibox account.

<Requirements />

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)

### How to recover your password

If you cannot access your email address, please contact our Trust and Safety team with the following information:
- Your username
- Your current and new email addresses
- The telephone number registered on your account
- If you have an individual account, your passport or local ID card
- If you have a corporate account, the certificate of incorporation and a copy of the last Scaleway invoice you received

Submit the complete set of required documents via email to `document@scaleway.com`.

Once your email address is updated, you can submit a [lost password form](https://console.online.net/en/user/recovery) to request the recovery codes for your account.
