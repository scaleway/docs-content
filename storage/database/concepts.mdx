## Allowed IPs

Access control list (ACL) rules [define permissions for remote access to an Instance](/storage/database/how-to/manage-allowed-ip-addresses/). A rule consists of an IP address or an IP range.

</Concept>

<Concept opened>

## Clone feature

Allows you to create a full copy of your Database Instance (including users and permissions) at a point in time. This new Instance is fully independent of its parent.

</Concept>

<Concept opened>

## Database backup

A database backup is a complete dated export of a Database Instance stored on an offsite backup backend. Once a backup is [created](/storage/database/how-to/manage-manual-backups/), it can be used to fully restore the database.

</Concept>

## Database snapshot

A snapshot is a full copy of a **volume** of your Database Instance at a certain point in time. [Creating a snapshot](/storage/database/how-to/manage-snapshots/) allows you to recover your volume data, much like [backups](#database-backup), but the snapshotted volume is deployed on a new Database Instance. Snapshots by themselves are not backups, since they are only of particular volumes, but can be used as part of the backup process.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Endpoint

A point of connection to a database. The endpoint is associated with an IPv4 address and a port, and contains the information of whether the endpoint is read-write or not.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Engine

A database engine is the software component that stores and retrieves your data from a database. Currently PostgreSQL version 9.6, 10, 11, 12 and 13 are available. MySQL is available in version 8.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## High availability

Is an option that allows you to create a secondary server, with an up-to-date replica of the database. If the primary server fails for any reason, the secondary can take over requests, reducing downtime.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Instance

An Instance is made up of multiple (at least 1) dedicated compute nodes, and is running a single Database Engine. Exactly one database engine is running on each node.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Managed database

Compared to traditional database management, which requires customers to provision their infrastructure and resources to manage their databases, managed databases offer the user access to a Database Instance without setting up the hardware or configuring the software.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Relational database

A database type that uses the relational model, which means that it stores and provides access to inter-related data points within the same database. Relational databases provide an intuitive, straightforward way of representing data in tables.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Region

A region is represented as a Geographical area such as France (Paris: `fr-par`), the Netherlands (Amsterdam: `nl-ams`) or Poland (Warsaw: `pl-waw`).
