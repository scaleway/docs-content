<Macro id="webhosting-online" />

The [webmail](https://webmail.online.net/) used at Scaleway to read your emails, offers options to encrypt your mails with PGP, helping to ensure:

- Confidentiality of emails
- That the sender is who they claim to be

<Message type="note">
  PGP encryption of your email includes a non-repudiation character. This means once the email is sent and received, you cannot deny having sent it.
</Message>

The [Scaleway webmail interface](https://webmail.online.net) currently offers one way of encrypting your emails: `Mailvelope`.

## How to configure Mailvelope

`Mailvelope` works on the client side and requires you to install an extension in your browser:

* [Extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mailvelope/kajibbejlbohfaggdiogboambcijhkke).
* [Extension for Firefox](https://download.mailvelope.com/releases/latest/mailvelope.firefox.xpi).

1. Install the `Mailvelope` extension depending on the browser you use.
2. Once the extension is installed, click **Options**.
3. **Generate** or **import** an already existing key. You can keep the advanced parameters in their default values.

4. Once generated or imported, the key appears in the list of available keys in the extension.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_once_generated.webp" />
5. Enter your Scaleway webmail interface and click the logo of the extension, then **Add**.

## How to write a PGP signed or encrypted email

1. Once you have configured the extension, go back to your webmail and open the interface for writing new emails.
2. Click the **icon of the extension** to write an email with PGP. A pop-up displays.
3. Write your email and click **sign** or **encrypt** the email.
4. Enter your key password:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_key_password.webp" />
5. Click **OK**.

## How to encrypt and sign an email

1. Choose your identity in the drop-down box.
2. Choose the addressee of your email to be able to encrypt it with their public key.
    <Message type="note">
    To sign an email, you must choose your identity in both the drop-down box and **Encrypt for** section.
    </Message>

## How to send an email

1. Once you have been redirected after encrypting and/or signing, your email will appear in its final form in the window of the extension displaying:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_send_email.webp" />
2. Click **Transfer** to transfer your email into your webmail's interface.
3. Once transferred, you can send the email from your interface.
