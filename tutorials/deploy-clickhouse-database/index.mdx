It uses a user-friendly SQL query dialect, provides built-in analytics capabilities, and its performance exceeds all other column-oriented database management systems.

# Installing ClickHouse

1. [Log into your Instance using SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).
2. Update the `apt` package cache and upgrade the software already installed on the Instance to the latest version available in the distribution repositories.
    ```
    apt update && apy upgrade -y
    ```
3. Install the prerequisites using the `apt` package manager:
    ```
    apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates dirmngr
    ```
4. Install the ClickHouse GPG key to check the packages for validity:
    ```
    apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 8919F6BD2B48D754
    ```
5. Add the ClickHouse repository to the configuration of the `apt` package manager:
    ```
    echo "deb https://packages.clickhouse.com/deb stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/clickhouse.list
    ```
6. Update the `apt` configuration to initialize the newly added repository:
    ```
    apt update
    ```
7. Install the ClickHouse server and client:
    ```
    apt install -y clickhouse-server clickhouse-client
    ```
8. Start the ClickHouse server:
