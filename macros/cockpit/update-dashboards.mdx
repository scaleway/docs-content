**Cockpit dashboard updates** <br /><br />

 Starting April 2024, a **new version of Cockpit will be released**. <br /><br />

 In this version, the concept of **regionalization** will be introduced to offer you more flexibility and resilience for seamless monitoring. If you have created customized dashboards with data for your Scaleway resources before April 2024, you will need to update your queries in Grafana, with the new regionalized [data sources](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#data-sources).
