Scaleway Managed MongoDB® allows you to run your Database Instances without setting up or managing infrastructure. Scaleway is responsible for implementing and maintaining features that improve the performance, scalability and security of your Database Instances.

If you have a self-managed MongoDB®, or you if use a different cloud provider, you can easily migrate your databases to Scaleway.

The migration processes described below are defined by the expected downtime. You can select the right option for your use case, depending on your downtime tolerance.

| Downtime tolerance | Recommended migration method | Benefits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Can afford downtime | [Classic mongodump/mongorestore workflow](/managed-mongodb-databases/api-cli/backup-and-restore/) | Easy, straightforward |
| Cannot afford downtime | [MongoDB® Cluster-to-Cluster sync tool](/managed-mongodb-databases/api-cli/cluster-to-cluster-sync) (`mongosync` binary) | Zero downtime, real-time data sync, flexible migration windows, easy rollback. Refer to the official PostgreSQL documentation for a list of the tool's [limitations](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/cluster-to-cluster-sync/current/reference/limitations/#std-label-c2c-limitationsl) |
