\* Lower limits may apply before account verification. Please contact our support team if you have any questions.

\** Total container memory is the sum of the memory allocated to all your containers at their maximum Scale.

These limits are enforced as [Account quotas](/console/my-account/reference-content/account-quotas/#serverless-containers).

## Configuration Restrictions

In order to ensure the proper functioning of the product, we restrict the use of certain ports and environment variables

* Blocked ports:
  * **25**: Due to potential abuse (spam), no outbound traffic is allowed through this port.
  * **465**: Due to potential abuse (spam), no outbound traffic is allowed through this port.
* Unavailable custom ports
  Please don't make your containers listen on these ports which are used by our service.
  * 8008
  * 8012
  * 8013
  * 8022
  * 9090
  * 9091
* Reserved environment variables:
  * `PORT`: Port on which your server should listen to default is 8080
  * `SCW_*`: Reserved for product configuration (for example: token validation)

## Architecture

Scaleway Containers only supports `amd64` [architecture](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images#architectures-other-than-amd64/) for
images.

For example, if you build an image using an ARM CPU, such as Apple Silicon, your image will be in the `arm64` architecture and you will have
an error message during deployment.

You must ensure to build your image to target `amd64` architecture.
