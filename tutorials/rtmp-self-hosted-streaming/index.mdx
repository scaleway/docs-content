## RTMP Overview

Live video streaming is something becoming more and more popular on the Internet and platforms like Twitch or YouTube provide a infrastructure to consume endless hours of live and recorded media. While these services provide a basic solution for free, they hold contents generally behind advertisements without a paid subscription. To have full control over your contents and thanks to open-source solutions it is easy to configure an own live streaming server that uses the [RTMP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-Time_Messaging_Protocol).

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have [configured your SSH Key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- You have a virtual cloud server running on Ubuntu Bionic Beaver (18.04)

## Setting up the server

1. Log into the instance via [SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/)

2. Update the apt sources lists and upgrade the software already installed on the instance:

  ```
  apt update && apt upgrade -y
  ```

3. All required packages for the basic server configuration are available via APT. Install `nginx` and the required packages:

  ```
  apt install build-essential libpcre3 libpcre3-dev libssl-dev nginx libnginx-mod-rtmp ffmpeg -y
  ```

4. Open the Nginx configuration file `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` in a text editor:

  ```
  nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
  ```

  And add the following lines at the end of the configuration file:

  ```
  rtmp {
          server {
                  listen 1935;
                  chunk_size 4096;
                  notify_method get;

                  application live {
                              on_publish http://localhost/auth;
                              live on;
                              #Set this to "record off" if you don't want to save a copy of your broadcasts
                              record all;
                              # The directory in which the recordings will be stored
                              record_path /var/www/html/recordings;
                              record_unique on;
                  }
          }
  }
  ```

  This sets up the live streaming server as well as recording of the streams. These will be stored in the directory `/var/www/html/recordings` of the instance.

5. Create the directory for recordings and make it writeable to the web server software:

  ```
  mkdir -p /var/www/html/recordings
  chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/recordings/
  ```

7. Open the file `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` in a text editor and add a `location` block to the server configuration:

  ```
  nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
  ```

  `libnginx-mod-rtmp` does not support authentication by default. To avoid that anybody knowing the stream key may broadcast media, copy / paste the following content into the server configuration block, under the `server_name` block, to setup a basic authentication mechanism. It will ask for a password when streaming. If the password is not correct, the user will see a `401 - Unauthorized` message:

  ```
  location /auth {
          if ($arg_pwd = 'a_secret_password') {
              return 200;
              }
              return 401;
  }
  ```

  Replace `a_secret_password` with a secret password of your choice which authenticates against the server for broadcasting streams.

8. Restart the Nginx web server:

  ```
  systemctl restart nginx.service
  ```

## Configuring the OBS client

To broadcast a stream from a local computer to the streaming server, a broadcast system is required. Download [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/), an open source broadcasting solution, which is available for Linux, Mac OS and Windows.

1. In the **Controls** section of the Interface, click **Settings** to enter the OBS configuration interface:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-obs_settings.png" alt="" />

2. Enter the **Stream** tab and enter the Information about your streaming instance:
   Server:

    - Service: Custom
    - Server: `rtmp://<instance_ip>/live`
    - Stream Key: _your_stream?pwd=a_secret_password_ (replace _your_stream_ with a custom name of your stream and _a_secret_password_ with the password you have set in the Nginx configuration)

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-obs_stream_settings.png" alt="" />

  Save the configuration and setup your scene within OBS Studio.

3. When ready, start broadcasting to your instance by clicking on **Start Streaming** in the **Controls** section of OBS.

## Connecting to the stream

The stream can be viewed in your favourite media player, for example [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/).

1. Start VLC and click **Open Media**

2. Click the **Network** tab and enter the URL of your Stream:

    - URL: `rtmp://<instance_ip>/live/<your_stream>`

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-vlc_source.png" alt="" />

3. Click **Open** and your stream will be visible in the media player.

## Setting up multi-streaming

It is also possible to rebroadcast a stream to platforms like Youtube, Facebook or Twitch to stream on multiple platforms at the same time.

1. Open the Nginx configuration file `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` in a text editor:

  ```
  nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
  ```

2. Edit the file as required for the different streaming services that you want to use:

  ```
  rtmp {
          server {
                  listen 1935;
                  chunk_size 4096;
                  notify_method get;

                  application live {
                              on_publish http://localhost/auth;
                              live on;
                              record all;
                              record_path /var/www/html/recordings;
                              record_unique on;
                              # Define the applications to which the stream will be pushed, comment them out to disable the ones not needed:
                              push rtmp://localhost/twitch;
                              push rtmp://localhost/facebook;
                  }

                        # Twitch Stream Application
                        application twitch {
                            live on;
                            record off;

                            # Only allow localhost to publish
                            allow publish 127.0.0.1;
                            deny publish all;

                            # Push URL with the Twitch stream key
                            push rtmp://live-cdg.twitch.tv/app/<twitch_stream_key>;
                        }

                        # Facebook Stream Application
                        application facebook {
                            live on;
                            record off;

                            #Only allow localhost to publish
                            allow publish 127.0.0.1;
                            deny publish all;

                            # Push URL with the Facebook stream key
                            push rtmps://live-api-s.facebook.com:443/rtmp/<facebook_stream_key>;

                        }
                    }
  }
  ```

  It is possible to add additional applications in the same way as the examples above.

3. Restart Nginx to activate the new configuration:

  ```
  systemctl restart nginx.service
  ```

4. Start broadcasting from OBS. You can now either view your stream via a media player like VLC, but also from broadcasting platforms like twitch:
