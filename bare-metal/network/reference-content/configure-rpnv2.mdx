[RPNv2](/dedibox-network/rpn/concepts/#rpn-v2) can be configured on any operating system supporting VLANs. The feature is available for selected Dedibox servers.


## How to configure RPNv2 on Debian

1. Install the vlan package by running the following command: 
    ```
    sudo apt-get install vlan
    ```
2. Edit your `/etc/network/interfaces` file as follows (assuming your RPN NIC is `eth1` and your VLAN ID is `3900`):
    ```
    auto eth1.3900
    iface eth1.3900 inet static
        address my.pri.vate.address
        netmask my.custom.net.mask
    ```

## How to configure RPNv2 on Ubuntu

<Message type="note">
  The following configuration example uses [Netplan](https://netplan.io/). If you are using a classic network configuration, refer to the [Debian documentation](https://www.debian.org/doc/).

```
network:
    version: 2
    renderer: networkd
    ethernets:
        mainif:
            match:
                macaddress: "de:ad:be:ef:ca:fe"
            set-name: mainif
            addresses: [ "10.3.0.5/23" ]
            gateway4: 10.3.0.1
            nameservers:
                addresses: [ "8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4" ]
                search: [ example.com ]
    vlans:
        vlan15:
            id: 15
            link: mainif
            addresses: [ "10.3.99.5/24" ]
```

## How to configure RPNv2 on CentOS

In the following 'how to' we assume your RPN NIC is `eth1`.

1. Create a configuration file for the parent interface, called `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1`:
    ```
    DEVICE=eth1
    TYPE=Ethernet
    BOOTPROTO=none
    ONBOOT=yes
    ```
2. Create another file for the vlan interface (assuming the VLAN ID is `3900`). The file is called `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1.3900`:
    ```
    DEVICE=eth1.3900
    BOOTPROTO=none
    ONBOOT=yes
    IPADDR=my.pri.vate.address
    PREFIX=CIDR.Netmask
    NETWORK=my.private.address.0
    VLAN=YES
    ```
## How to configure RPNv2 on Rocky Linux 9

For the purpose of this how to, we assume that your RPN NIC is `eth1`, the VLAN ID is `2001` and the new connection name is `VLAN2001`. 

To add a new VLAN connection using the nmcli command, follow the steps below:

```
[root@srv1 ~]# nmcli connection add type vlan ifname VLAN2001 dev eth1 id 2001
Connection 'vlan-VLAN2001' (116121e0-4dca-4fb7-82ac-6e38b0f7d277) successfully added.d
```

Show the updated VLAN connection :

```
[root@srv1 ~]# nmcli connection show 
NAME           UUID                                  TYPE      DEVICE   
vlan-VLAN2001  116121e0-4dca-4fb7-82ac-6e3888f7d277  vlan      VLAN2001
```

Configure the second server to enable reachability from the group members.

Assign an IP address to VLAN `2001` (your VLAN ID) on `serv1` and change `ipv4.method` to use the manual method

```
nmcli connection modify vlan-VLAN2001 ipv4.addresses 192.168.10.101/24 ipv4.method manual ipv4.addresses
nmcli connection up vlan-VLAN2001
```

Assign an IP address to VLAN `2001` (your VLAN) on `serv2` and change `ipv4.method` to use the manual method

```
nmcli connection modify vlan-VLAN2001 ipv4.addresses 192.168.10.100/24 ipv4.method manual ipv4.addresses
nmcli connection up vlan-VLAN2001
```

Test your configuration via `ping`:

From 192.168.0.100 to 192.168.0.101

```
[root@srv1 ~]# ping 192.168.0.101
PING 192.168.0.101 (192.168.0.101) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.0.101: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=12.9 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.0.101: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=12.9 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.0.101: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=13.1 ms
```

From 192.168.0.100 to 192.168.0.100

```
[root@frontend-srv ~]# ping 192.168.0.100
PING 192.168.0.100 (192.168.0.100) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.0.100: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=13.2 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.0.100: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=13.1 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.0.100: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=13.1 ms
```

## How to configure RPNv2 on FreeBSD

Edit your `/etc/rc.conf file`, assuming `ix0` is your RPN NIC, and `3900` your VLAN ID:

```
ifconfig_ix0="up"
cloned_interfaces="vlan3900"
ifconfig_vlan3900="inet my.pri.vate.IP/CIDR.NETMASK vlan 3900 vlandev ix0"
```

Do not forget to adapt the VLAN ID, Interface Name, and Network configuration to your needs.

## How to configure RPNv2 on ESXi

On ESXi you can create virtual switches that talk directly on the corresponding VLAN ID.

1. Check your network interfaces, to discover which one corresponds to the RPN interface. In the following example, the RPN interface is `vmnic2`. 
    <Lightbox src ="scaleway_esxi_interfaces.webp" alt="" />
2. Enter the **Virtual switch** section and add a new one by clicking **Add standard virtual switch**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_esxi_vswitch.webp" alt="" />
3. Enter a name for the virtual switch, set the MTU to `9000` and select the RPN interface as uplink:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_esxi_rpn.webp" alt="" />
4. Click the **Port groups** tab and click **Add port group** to create a new one:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_esxi_port_group.webp" alt="" />
5. Enter a name for the new port group and set the VLAN IP, then select the virtual switch and click **Add**.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_esxi_vlan.webp" alt="" />

The virtual switch is configured now. 

Create a NIC directly linked on your new Group (**VM Network** in the example above) and configure it in your virtual machine using your address-plan.

  No VLAN Configuration is required in your VM, everything is handled in your vSwitch directly.

## How to configure RPNv2 on Proxmox

1. Login to the Proxmox web interface anc click **System** > **Network**.
2. Click **Create** on the network page.
3. Configure your bridge with a `bridge_port` which will be named after your RPN NIC, and your VLAN ID.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_proxmox_rpn.webp" width="" />

    <Message type="tip">
      For instance, if your RPN NIC is eth2 and your VLAN ID 3900, name it `eth2.3900`.
