<Requirements />

Open a terminal and run the following command to export your API secret key and Organization ID.

   ```bash
   export SCW_SECRET_KEY="<API secret key>"
   export SCW_ORGANIZATION_ID="<Scaleway Organization ID>"
   ```

## Consumption of the current month

Run the following command to obtain your consumption over the current month.

   ```bash
   scw billing consumption list \
   --organization-id=$SCW_ORGANIZATION_ID
   ```

## Consumption of a product category

Run the following command to obtain your consumption over the current month for just one category of products.

   Specify the target `category_name` as one of:

   - `BareMetal`
   - `Compute`
   - `Containers`
   - `Labs`
   - `Managed Databases`
   - `Managed Services`
   - `Network`
   - `Object Storage`
   - `Observability`
   - `Security and Identity`

   ```bash
   scw billing consumption list \
   --organization-id=$SCW_ORGANIZATION_ID \
   --category-name=Compute
   ```

## Consumption of a specific month

Run the following command to obtain your consumption for a specific month.

   Specify the target billing period as `YYYY-MM`, e.g. `2023-11`.

   ```bash
   scw billing consumption list \
   --organization-id=$SCW_ORGANIZATION_ID \
   --billing-period=2023-11
   ```

## Consumption of a specific Project

Run the following command to obtain your consumption for a specific Project only.

   First, choose your target `project_id`:

   ```bash
   export SCW_PROJECT_ID="<Scaleway Project ID>"
   ```

   Then inject it in your API request:

   ```bash
   scw billing consumption list \
   --project-id=SCW_PROJECT_ID
   ```
