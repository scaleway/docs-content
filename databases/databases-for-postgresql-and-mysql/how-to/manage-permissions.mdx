Permissions define the actions a user can perform on a logical database. A database user is generated automatically when you create your Database Instance and this user is attributed all permissions. 
However, newly created users have no permissions by default.

## Set permissions for a new user

During user creation, the permissions panel can be accessed through the top tab menu. 
For more information see [how to add users](/databases/databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/add-users).

<Message type="note">

Permissions are applied on existing items **at the moment the configuration is set**, and not applied to any items created afterward. 
When you modify your Database configuration, your configured permissions are automatically set to **Custom**. The **Custom** setting ensures that your permissions are still valid for items created before you reconfigured your Database. 
Any items created after you change your configuration will not have permissions applied to them, you must set new permissions.
