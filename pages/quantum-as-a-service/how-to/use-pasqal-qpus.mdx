**Pasqal** is a full-stack quantum computing company based in France, pioneering the use of **Neutral Atoms** (manipulated by optical tweezers) to build quantum processors.

Their technology is fundamentally different from superconducting circuits. Instead of fixed wires, Pasqal uses lasers to hold individual atoms (Rubidium or Strontium) in 2D or 3D arrays. This allows for **arbitrary topology**: you can arrange the qubits (atoms) in any shape (triangle, square, honeycombs) to match the geometry of the problem you are trying to solve.

Pasqal processors operate primarily in **Analog Mode** (applying pulses to the whole system to evolve the Hamiltonian), making them exceptionally powerful for quantum simulation and combinatorial optimization.

## Pasqal Processors on Scaleway

Scaleway provides access to Pasqal's "Fresnel" generation devices and their digital twins.

### Hardware & Emulator
* **Fresnel (100+ Qubits):** The QPU allows you to trap and control over 100 atoms. It exploits the **Rydberg blockade** mechanism to create entanglement between atoms.
* **Locations:** We provide access to two geographically distinct units:
    * `QPU-FRESNEL-100PQ-FR` (Located in France)
    * `QPU-FRESNEL-100PQ-CA` (Located in Canada)
    * *Note: Both devices offer similar specifications.*
* **Emulator:** `EMU-FRESNEL-100PQ` is a high-performance digital twin running on A100 GPU cluster. It simulates the physics of the Fresnel device to validate your pulse sequences before running on real hardware.

## Pulser: The native SDK

To program neutral atoms, you don't typically use "Gates" (like CNOT or Hadamard) as the primary abstraction. Instead, you define **Pulse Sequences** using **Pulser**, Pasqal's open-source Python SDK.

**Pulser allows you to:**
* **Define the register:** Place your atoms at specific coordinates.
* **Design the sequence:** Define the laser pulses (amplitude, detuning, phase) applied to the atoms over time.
* **Execute:** Run the sequence locally or remotely.

On Scaleway QaaS, the integration is handled by the `pulser-scaleway` package, which acts as a remote backend for your sequences.

## Accessing Pasqal via Scaleway QaaS

### 1. Prerequisites

* A Scaleway account with a valid **Project ID**.
* A Scaleway **API Key** (Secret Key).
* Python installed with `pulser` and `pulser-scaleway`.

### 2. Installation

```bash
pip install pulser-scaleway
```

### 3. Accessing Pasqal QPUs via Scaleway QaaS

The following example shows how to create a simple register, define a pulse, and send it to Fresnel QPU emulator.

```python
from pulser import Pulse, Sequence, Register
from pulser_scaleway import ScalewayProvider

# 1. Initiate provider
qaas_connection = ScalewayProvider(
    project_id="your-project-id",
    secret_key="your-secret-key",
)

# 2. Retrieve all QPU devices (emulated or real) and select the good one
devices = qaas_connection.fetch_available_devices()
fresnel_device = devices["EMU-FRESNEL-100PQ"]

# 3. Create a register of trapped atoms before performing operation on them
# and declare the sequence of pulses to perform on the register
register = Register.square(5, 5).with_automatic_layout(fresnel_device)
sequence = Sequence(register, fresnel_device)
sequence.declare_channel("rydberg_global", "rydberg_global")
t = sequence.declare_variable("t", dtype=int)

amp_wf = BlackmanWaveform(t, np.pi)
det_wf = RampWaveform(t, -5, 5)
sequence.add(Pulse(amp_wf, det_wf, 0), "rydberg_global")

# 4. Declare a backend based on the sequence and remote connection
backend = QPUBackend(sequence=sequence, connection=qaas_connection)

# 5. Run jobs with different arguments over the same sequence and register
results = backend.run(
    job_params=[
        {"runs": 100, "variables": {"t": 1000}},
        {"runs": 20, "variables": {"t": 2000}},
    ],
    wait=True,
)

print("Results:", results)
```

<Message type="tip"> Analog vs Digital: While Pulser focuses on Analog computing (Pulses), it also supports a "Digital" mode to emulate gate-based circuits. However, Pasqal's hardware advantage lies primarily in the Analog approach for optimization problems (MIS, MaxCut). </Message>
