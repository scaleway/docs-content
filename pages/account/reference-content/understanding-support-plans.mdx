## Support plans pricing

When you subscribe to a support plan, besides the free, Basic plan, you either pay a set monthly fee, or a percentage of your net spend.

This means your support plan fees depend on how much you spend per month. You will pay whichever fee out of the two is the greater.

To determine your monthly payment, calculate the percentage of your monthly spend. If the result is:
    - Less than the fixed monthly fee, you will pay the fixed price.
    - Equal to or higher than the fixed price, you will pay a percentage of your net monthly spend.

The fixed monthly fees and the percentages vary according to your support plan:

| Plan            | Fixed monthly fee     | Percentage of net spend     |
| :--------------------------: | :----------------: | :----------------:  |
| **Advanced**        | €50         | 5%   |
| **Business**        | €250          |  10%  |
| **Enterprise**        | €999         |  20%  |
