Serverless SQL Databases is based on PostgreSQL engine, and thus provides standard PostgreSQL compatibility for most PostgreSQL features and commands. Due to autoscaling, the cold start can take a couple of seconds and be interpreted as an error by some drivers or third party libraries.

If you require strict compatibility with all PostgreSQL features, use [Managed Databases for PostgreSQL](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/quickstart/) instead.

## Connection timeouts using Prisma

Prisma's default connection timeout is 5 seconds. In some cases, when performing a `prisma` command, the following error will display:

```
Error: P1001

Can't reach database server at `{15ad0be1-5610-8b4c-8276-f4f38e1f7895}.pg.sdb.fr-par.scw.cloud`:`5432`

Please make sure your database server is running at `15ad0be1-5610-8b4c-8276-f4f38e1f7895.pg.sdb.fr-par.scw.cloud`:`5432`.
```

To fix this issue, set a higher connection timeout in the Prisma connection parameters, such as 10 seconds. Update your `schema.prisma` file or your `.env` file by adding `?pool_timeout=10&connect_timeout=10` at the end of your connection string:

```js
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://{username}:{password}@{host}:5432/{databasename}?pool_timeout=10&connect_timeout=10"
}
```
