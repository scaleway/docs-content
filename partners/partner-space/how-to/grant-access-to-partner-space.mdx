    ## How to create a policy for Partner Space access

    Only users to whom this policy applies will have access to the Partner Space. 
    1. Click **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** from the top-right of your [Organization dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) in the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) displays.
    2. Click the **Policies** tab. A list of the Organization’s existing policies displays.
    3. Click **Create policy**. The creation wizard displays.
    4. Complete the steps on the first page of the creation wizard:
        - Enter a name for the policy (e.g., “Reseller”)
        - Add a description and/or a tag (optional)
    5. Set the principal type as **Group**. 
    6. Define the Group as either **Administrators** (access to the entire Organization) or **Billing Administrators** (access to the billing features, including the Partner Space). 
    7. Select the **Access to Organization features** scope.
    8. Click **Validate** to continue. 
    9. Choose **Reseller** from the permission sets list. 
    10. Tick the **ResellerFullAccess** box.
    11. Click **Validate**. The rule, with its scope and permission sets, is added to the list of the policy’s rules.
    12. Click **Create policy** to finish. You are returned to the **Policies** tab, where the newly created policy appears in the list.

    ## How to grant access to the Partner Space

    Now that you have created the Reseller policy, you can apply it to users who need access to the Partner Space. 
    
    1. Click the **Users** tab. 
    2. Locate the user you want to grant access to. If the user is not yet part of the Organization, you will need to [invite them](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/invite-user-to-orga/) first. 
    3. Click <Icon name="more" /> to the right of the row. The overview of the user’s information displays.
    4. Click the **Group & Policies** tab. 
    5. Click **Add to group**. 
    6. Select either **Administrator** or **Billing Administrator**, depending on the policy you created.

    Refer to the [IAM documentation](/identity-and-access-management/iam/) for more details about user permission and access management.
