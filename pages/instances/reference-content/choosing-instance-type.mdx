Scaleway **CPU & GPU Instances** are virtual machines in the cloud. You can create and manage Instances via our [console](https://console.scaleway.com/), [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/), [CLI](https://www.scaleway.com/en/cli/), or [other developer tools](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/). When you [create an Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/), you must select the **Instance type** you want to create. This page explains the different ranges of Instances available at Scaleway and helps you to choose the best one for your needs.

## Different Instances for different use cases

Different Instance types have different prices and are designed for different use cases. They offer different levels of power and performance, based on their **vCPU** (cores), **memory**, **storage**, and **bandwidth**.

You may not need a super powerful Instance if you just want to play around and do some experiments for personal projects, so a **Learning** Instance could be perfect for you in this case. But if you want to use your Instance to host a business-critical application in production, you need the power and reliability of a **Production-Optimized** Instance, precisely designed to reliably handle this type of demanding workload.

## Instance technical specifications

Instances are virtual machines: multiple Instances can run on one "real" physical host machine in a data center. The physical host has a **hypervisor**, which **virtualizes** the real physical resources of the host (CPU, memory, storage, etc.) and ensures that each Instance receives its share of those resources. The different types of resources that go into specifying an Instance type are:

* **vCPU**: A **v**irtual **C**entralized **P**rocessing **U**nit represents a part of the underlying physical CPU that is assigned to a particular Instance.

    Each vCPU may be [shared or dedicated](/instances/reference-content/choosing-shared-vs-dedicated-cpus/).
        - **Shared**: A [context-switching mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch) allows a physical core to be shared between multiple vCPUs for multitasking. Instances with shared vCPU can be more cost-effective for running small, non-resource-intensive applications than dedicated vCPU Instances. Our different types of shared vCPU Instances offer a variety of options to balance price and performance depending on your use case.
        - **Dedicated**: Instances with dedicated vCPU do not share their compute resources with other Instances (1 vCPU = 1 CPU thread dedicated to that Instance). This type of Instance is particularly recommended for running production-grade compute-intensive applications.

        <Message type="tip">
          Scaleway provides CPU Instances equipped with either x86 or ARM CPUs. ARM Instances generally offer higher energy and cost efficiency, while x86 Instances provide wider software compatibility and stronger single-thread performance. [Learn more about the differences between ARM and x86-based Instances](/instances/reference-content/understanding-differences-x86-arm/).
        </Message>

* **Core**: A core is a physical unit of vCPU. More cores give an Instance more computing power. A description of an Instance's cores may look something like `4 x86 64bit`, where **4** refers to the number of cores, **x86** refers to the microprocessor family, and **64bit** refers to the chunk size used by the microprocessor for processing data.

* **Memory** (aka **R**andom **A**ccess **M**emory): RAM is like an Instance's short-term memory. Data that is currently being used by the vPCU is stored in RAM. More RAM enables faster computing.

* **Bandwidth**: Bandwidth refers to the volume of data that can be sent to/from an Instance in a given amount of time (usually **p**er **s**econd).

* **Storage**: Different Instance types may support **Local** and/or **Block** Storage:
    - **Local** storage is an all-SSD-based storage solution, hosted on the local hypervisor.
    - **Block** storage is more flexible, network-attached storage that can be plugged in and out of Instances like virtual hard drives. Some Instances only support Block Storage, and boot themselves from their Block Storage.

    Depending on the Instance type, you can attach additional storage volumes and increase their size according to your needs.
