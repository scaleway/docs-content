InterLink is currently in [Private Beta](https://www.scaleway.com/en/betas/), and only available to selected testers.

InterLink uses [**B**order **G**ateway **P**rotocol](/interlink/concepts/#border-gateway-protocol-bgp) to exchange routing information between the customerâ€™s infrastructure and the Scaleway VPC. Each side advertises IP prefixes for its own internal subnets and resources, to allow the other side to dynamically learn and update its internal routes, facilitating efficient traffic flow. However, by default, **all routes across an InterLink are blocked**. You must create and attach an [allowed routes list](/interlink/concepts/#allowed-routes-list) aka routing policy, to set IP prefix filters for the route advertisements you want to whitelist. This facilitates traffic flow across the InterLink.

When creating an allowed routes list, you specify one or many IP ranges representing the outgoing routes to announce from the Scaleway VPC, and one or many IP ranges representing the incoming route announcements to accept from the external infrastructure. When [route propagation](#route-propagation) is activated, the route ranges defined in the allowed routes list are whitelisted, and traffic can flow across the InterLink along these routes.

You may also know allowed routes lists under the terms "routing policy", or "route filters".

Learn more about routing across an InterLink in our [detailed overview](/interlink/reference-content/overview/#routing-across-an-interLink).

## How to create an allowed routes list

1. Click **InterLink** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. A listing of your InterLinks displays.

2. Click the **Allowed routes** tab. A listing of your allowed routes lists displays.

3. Click **+Create allowed routes list**. The **Create an allowed routes List** wizard displays.

        <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-allowed-routes.webp" alt="In the Scaleway console, the Create an allowed routes List wizard is displayed. There are 3 steps: 1. Choose a name and region, 2. Whitelist outgoing routes and 3. Whitelist incoming routes" />

4. Enter a name for the list, or leave the randomly-generated name in place. 

5. Choose a region for the list. It can only be attached to InterLinks within the same region.

6. Whitelist the outgoing routes to allow. For each entry:
    - Select whether it is of type IPv4 or IPv6.
    - Enter an IP prefix to define a range of route announcements to whitelist, e.g.  `172.16.4.0/22`. 
    - Click **Add** when complete.

        <Message type="tip">
        Routes within these destinations will be propagated, allowing traffic from your external infrastructure to be routed via InterLink to your VPC. For example, adding `172.16.4.0/22` whitelists all 1,024 IPs in this block, from `172.16.4.0` to `172.16.7.255`.

        IPv4 and IPv6 routes must be defined separately..

7. Whitelist the incoming routes to allow, in the same way you did for outgoing routes. Outgoing routes concern announcements to accept from the external infrastructure. Traffic can be routed via InterLink from your Scaleway VPC to your external infrastructure along these routes.

8. Click **Create allowed routes list**.
The list is created, and you are returned to the listing of your allowed routes lists.

Remember to [attach the list to an InterLink](/interlink/how-to/configure-interlink/#how-to-attach-an-allowed-routes-list) for it to take effect.  Each InterLink can have one allowed routes list attached to it, but a single allowed routes list can be attached to multiple InterLinks, if desired.
