## Installing MedusaJS

1. [Log into your Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/) using SSH.
2. Update the APT package cache and upgrade the software already installed on your Instance to the latest version available in Ubuntu's repository.
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
3. Prepare your system by adding the NodeJS and Yarn repositories to your APT package manager.
    ```
    curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
    curl -sL https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/yarnkey.gpg >/dev/null
    echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/yarnkey.gpg] https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
    ```
4. Update the APT cache and install the required packages for Medusa:
    ```
    apt update && apt install yarn nodejs git
    ```

5. Install the Medusa command line interface using the following command:
    ```
    yarn global add @medusajs/medusa-cli
    ```
6. Run the following command to create a Medusa app:
    ```
    yarn create medusa-app
    ```
7. Specify the directory name for your project. The Medusa application will be installed in this directory. You can go with the default `my-medusa-store` or change it to any name you prefer.
8. Select the Medusa backend starter to use. The Medusa backend is created from a starter template, the default option is `medusa-starter-default`. Pick the default option and press Enter. The `medusa-starter-default` includes the admin plugin, which allows you to access the admin dashboard.
9. Choose the Medusa storefront starter to use. Several starters are proposed. Select the default option `Next.js Starter` and press enter to launch the installation of the required packages. Once the installation is done, the following message displays:
    ```
    Your project is ready ðŸš€. The available commands are:

      Medusa API
      cd my-medusa-store/backend
      yarn start


      Storefront
      cd my-medusa-store/storefront
      yarn dev
    ```

## Running MedusaJS

1. Run the following commands to access your directory and start the Medusa API:
    ```
    cd my-medusa-store/backend
    yarn start
    ```
2. Open another terminal window, and launch the Medusa storefront development server:
    ```
    cd my-medusa-store/storefront
    yarn dev
    ```
3. Point your web browser to `http://<your-instance-ip>:8000/`. Your Medusa storefront displays.

## Customizing your project

Inside the project's root directory, specified at the start of the installation process, you find the following directory structure:
```
/my-medusa-store
  /backend // Medusa backend
  /storefront // Medusa storefront starter
```

You can edit the files to adapt them towards your requirements. For instance, if you wish to make changes to the homepage of your MedusaJS application, you can modify the `my-medusa-store/storefront/src/pages/index.tsx` file.
This particular file comprises the components used for rendering your application's homepage. If you want to make changes to the backend of your application, you can edit the files in the `my-medusa-store/backend` towards your specific requirements.

MedusaJS comes with a built-in SQLite database for development and testing purposes. However, if you want to deploy your application to production, the use of a PostgreSQL such as a [Managed Database for PostgreSQL](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/quickstart) is highly recommended.

The tool is designed to be customized to your specific needs, and a wide section of [Medusa Modules](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/overview) is available to be integrated in your application. For more information on how to configure MedusaJS, refer to the [official Medusa documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/) and the [Medusa development documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/overview)
