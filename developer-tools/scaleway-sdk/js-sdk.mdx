The Scaleway JS SDK, developed by Scaleway, is a dynamic tool for developers who use JavaScript to interact with Scaleway's cloud services. It makes complex tasks like managing servers, handling storage operations, and setting up networking more manageable by automating intricate API calls and the authentication process. This SDK is instrumental for integrating or programmatically managing Scaleway's cloud resources.

  The SDK is designed to function in a Node.js environment. Browser-based requests are not supported due to CORS restrictions.

## Installing the JS SDK

To use the SDK, you need an access key and a secret key for the Scaleway API. Refer to Scaleway's [documentation on API keys](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) for instructions on creating and retrieving these keys.

Here's a basic setup example:

```ts
import { Registry, createClient } from '@scaleway/sdk'

const client = createClient({
  accessKey: 'SCWXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX',
  secretKey: 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx',
  defaultProjectId: 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx',
  defaultRegion: 'fr-par',
  defaultZone: 'fr-par-1',
})

const api = new Registry.v1.API(client)
```

## Using the SDK

The SDK is written in TypeScript, offering the full benefits of this language. 

1. For any product, its types are available under `Product.version`. For example, access the `Image` interface of Registry v1 using `Registry.v1.Image`.

2. We also provide exports of **errors** under the `Errors` namespace, which helps in differentiating various error cases, like `Errors.PermissionsDeniedError`.
