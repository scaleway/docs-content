Docker is a powerful and widely-used open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications in a consistent and efficient manner.

The tool allows you to run software in a standardized environment called a "container" that encapsulates an application along with all its dependencies and configurations.

The main components that you install by following this tutorial are:

* **Docker Daemon**: The Docker daemon is a background service responsible for managing Docker containers, images, networks, and volumes. It listens for Docker API requests and handles container lifecycle operations like starting, stopping, and monitoring containers.
* **Docker CLI**: The Docker Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool that allows users to interact with Docker. It provides a set of commands to manage containers, images, networks, volumes, and other Docker resources.
* **Docker Compose**: Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and manage multi-container applications using a YAML file. It simplifies the process of defining the services, networks, and volumes required for your application stack.
* **Containerd**: Containerd is an open-source container runtime that serves as the industry-standard container runtime interface (CRI) between higher-level container management systems (such as Docker and Kubernetes) and the low-level kernel features responsible for running containers.

## Installing Docker Engine on Ubuntu Jammy Jellyfish (22.04 LTS)

Prior to installing Docker Engine on a new host machine, it is required to configure the Docker repository. Once the repository is set up, you can proceed to install and keep Docker updated directly from the repository.
1. Login to your Instance using SSH:
  ```
  ssh root@<YOUR_INSTANCE_IP>
  ```
2. Update the `apt` packet cache and upgrate the software already installed on your Instance to the latest version available in the repository:
  ```
  apt update && apt upgrade -y
  ```

### Setting up the Docker repository

1. Install packages that are required to download packages using `apt` via a HTTPS connection.
  ```
  apt install ca-certificates curl gnupg
  ```

2. Add the official Docker GPG key to validate the downloaded packages.
  ```
  install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
  curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
  chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
  ```

3. Use the following command to configure the Docker repository:
  ```
  echo \
  "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
  tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
  ```

### Installing Docker Engine using `apt`

1. Update the `apt` packet cache:
  ```
  apt update
  ```

2. Install the latest version of Docker Engine, Containerd, and Docker Compose:
  ```
  apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin -y
  ```

3. Verify that the installation of Docker Engine was successfully:
  ```
  docker run hello-world
  ```
  You have now successfully installed the latest version of Docker Engine on your Instance
