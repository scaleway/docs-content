## Problem
You are unable to push images to Scaleway's Container Registry.

### Symptoms
- The `docker push` command fails with an error message.
- Authentication or authorization errors occur.
- The image push process hangs or times out.

## Possible causes
- Incorrect authentication or authorization settings.
- Misconfigured or outdated Docker client.
- Network connectivity issues or firewall restrictions.
- Exceeded Container Registry quotas or limits.

## Solutions

### Verify authentication and authorization
- Ensure you are logged in with a valid Scaleway account using `docker login`.
- Confirm that your account has the necessary permissions to push images.
- Verify that your Docker client is [correctly configured](/container-registry/how-to/connect-docker-cli/) for Scaleway's Container Registry.

### Review error messages and logs
- Run the push command with verbose output for more details:
  ```sh
  docker push --debug <your-image>
  ```
- Check the Docker client logs for warnings or errors:
  ```sh
  docker logs <container_id>
  ```
- Verify Scaleway’s Container Registry [status](https://status.scaleway.com/) for any ongoing incidents.

### Check Docker configuration and version
- Ensure your Docker client is up-to-date by running:
  ```sh
  docker --version
  ```
- Check for configuration errors in the Docker daemon and client.
- Review the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) for known compatibility issues.

### Investigate network connectivity issues
- Confirm that your internet connection is stable.
- Check firewall or proxy settings that may be blocking the connection.
- Try pushing the image from a different network or VPN to rule out local issues.

### Verify Container Registry quotas and limits
- Ensure you have not exceeded your Scaleway Container Registry storage limits.
- Refer to Scaleway’s documentation for [quota information](/organizations-and-projects/additional-content/organization-quotas/#container-registry).

## Additional troubleshooting steps
- Try pushing a small test image to verify general functionality:
  ```sh
  docker pull alpine && docker tag alpine <your-registry>/test-image && docker push <your-registry>/test-image
  ```
- Review Docker’s official [troubleshooting guides](https://docs.docker.com/tags/troubleshooting/) for further insights.
