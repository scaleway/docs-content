## What happens when I exceed my fair-use traffic?
Your monthly fair-use traffic allowance includes all incoming and outgoing data. Each plan comes with a specified monthly data allocation.
If you exceed this limit, your connection speed will be reduced for the remainder of the billing cycle, in accordance with your plan's terms.
The speed of your connection will return to normal at the start of the next billing cycle when your data allocation resets.

For security reasons the SMTP ports of your Dedibox VPS are blocked and it is not possible to send email from your virtual machine.

## How secure is a Dedibox VPS?
Each Dedibox VPS is isolated from other virtual servers on the same host, ensuring security. However, best security practices, including regular updates, strong passwords, and firewall configurations, are essential to enhance security further.

## Are IP addresses for Dedibox VPS assigned statically?
IP addresses for Dedibox VPS are generally assigned statically. However, in rare cases, such as maintenance or replacement of a faulty host node, we may perform IP migrations, which can result in a change of IP address.
