Get more information on your email delivery issues with [flags](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#flags). Whether it is a [hard bounce](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#hard-bounce), [soft bounce](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#soft-bounce), [mailbox full](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#flags), or other issues, these flags provide immediate insights into the reasons behind delivery failures.

You can filter on these flags via the API and from the **Email activity** tab of your Transactional Email domain in the Scaleway console.

For more information, refer to the [flags concept page](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#flags) or the [documentation](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/manage-email-activity/) on how to manage your email activity.
