The creation and management of TLS certificates is included in the Managed Database for PostgreSQL offers.

A certificate is generated automatically upon the creation of a Database Instance.

You can renew your certificates at any time. This allows you to renew your certificates whenever you add a new endpoint, for example.

PostgreSQL natively supports SSL connections that enhance the security of client/server communications with TLS protocols. PostgreSQL does not, however, verify server certificates by default.

To avoid the risk of the identity of a server being spoofed, clients can verify the server's identity using a [chain of trust](/concepts#chain-of-trust).
