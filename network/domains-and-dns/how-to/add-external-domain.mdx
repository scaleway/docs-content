Domains and DNS allows you to manage and register your [internal](/network/domains-and-dns/concepts/#internal-domain) and [external domains](/network/domains-and-dns/concepts/#external-domain) and configure and manage their DNS zones.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
</Message>


1. Click **Domains and DNS** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Domains and DNS dashboard displays with a list of your internal domains.
2. Click the **External Domains** tab, then click <Icon name="plus" /> **Manage new domain**.
3. Enter the external domain name in the box and click the search icon to check if the domain exists. The estimated cost for the domain name displays.

4. Click **Manage as external**. The instructions to set up your external domain display. Add a `TXT`record to the root zone of the domain at your current registrar to validate the domain ownership.
      <Message type="note">
        `TXT` means text record. It is used to carry machine-readable data such as information for automated domain validation.
      </Message>
      Copy the token displayed and create a `TXT` record with the name `_scaleway-challenge` within your current DNS zone as instructed:
      <Lightbox src="scaleway-dns-validation-token.webp" alt="" />
      <Message type="important">
        The token's presence will be checked regularly. If it has not been set within 48 hours, the external domain will be deleted from the service.
      </Message>
5. Click **Back to my external domains** once you have set up the record in your current DNS zone. The list of your external domains displays. The status of any ongoing DNS challenges is visible through a blue dot on the left-side of the domain name:
      <Lightbox src="scaleway-dns-ongoing-validation.webp" alt="" />

Once the record has been validated, the dot turns green, and you will receive an email with further instructions on how to update your domain's DNS servers.

Update the name server information at your current registrar once your domain name is validated in order to link your existing domain name with your Scaleway Domains DNS zone.
<Message type="note">
  Scaleway's DNS servers are:
  * ns0.dom.scw.cloud
  * ns1.dom.scw.cloud
</Message>

You can verify if the association of your domain has been successfully completed by checking the **Name Servers** list in the **Domain Information** page.

<Message type="important">
  If the entire process is not completed after 14 days, the domains are deleted from the DNS and you will have to start over. Emails reminding you to complete the process are sent on days 7 and 13.
