Scaleway Kubernetes [Kapsule](/containers/kubernetes/concepts/#kubernetes-kapsule) and [Kosmos](/containers/kubernetes/concepts/#kubernetes-kosmos) provide a managed environment to create, configure, and run a cluster of preconfigured machines for containerized applications. This allows you to create Kubernetes clusters without the complexity of managing the infrastructure. You can create a Kapsule cluster to your required specifications, edit it after creation, and delete it all when you no longer need it. You might also want to check out our how-to on [deploying an image on your cluster](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/deploy-image-from-container-registry).

## How to create a Kubernetes cluster

### Cluster configuration

1. Navigate to **Kubernetes** under the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The Kubernetes dashboard displays.
2. Click **Create cluster** to launch the cluster creation wizard.
3. On the cluster configuration page, provide the following details:
    * Check the Organization and Project for the new cluster.
        <Message type="important">
          You can not move a cluster from one Organization or Project to another once created.
        </Message>
    * Select **Kubernetes Kapsule** as the cluster type, which uses exclusively Scaleway Instances.
      <Message type="note">
        This guide covers the creation of a **Kubernetes Kapsule** cluster. For Kubernetes Kosmos clusters, refer to the [Kubernetes Kosmos documentation](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-kosmos-cluster/).
      </Message>
    * Choose the geographical **region** for the cluster.
    * Select the control plane offer for your cluster. Options include shared or dedicated control planes.
        <Message type="tip">
          Need help deciding on a control plane offer? Learn more about our [Kubernetes control plane offers](/containers/kubernetes/reference-content/kubernetes-control-plane-offers/).
        </Message>
    * Specify the Kubernetes **version** for your cluster.
4. Provide a **name** for the cluster, along with an optional description and tags for better organization.
5. Configure the **Private Network** for the cluster. This ensures secure and isolated network communication. Each cluster is auto-configured with a /22 IP subnet.
   Click **Select Private Network** to:
    * Attach an existing Private Network (VPC) within the same Availability Zone from the drop-down menu.
    * Attach a new Private Network to the cluster.
    <Message type="important">
      The Private Network cannot be detached, and the cluster cannot be moved to another Private Network post-creation.
    </Message>
6. Click **Configure pools** to proceed.

### Pool configuration

This section outlines the settings for your cluster pools.

1. Specify the following for each pool:
    * The **Availability Zone** for the pool's nodes.
    * The **node type** for the pool.
    * Configure **pool options**, including node count and whether to enable autoscaling. Options also include enabling autoheal and linking to a placement group, or you can retain default settings.
        <Message type="tip">
          Unsure about the autoheal feature? [Learn more about autoheal.](/containers/kubernetes/concepts/#autoheal)
        </Message>
    * Enable full isolation if required.
        <Message type="tip">
          Need more information on full isolation? [Learn more about full isolation.](/containers/kubernetes/reference-content/secure-cluster-with-private-network/#what-is-the-difference-between-controlled-isolation-and-full-isolation)
        </Message>
2. Click **Add pool** to integrate the pool into the cluster.
3. To add additional pools, click **Expand** and repeat the above steps.
    <Message type="tip">
      You can add or remove pools as needed before finalizing your cluster configuration. To remove a pool, click **Remove** within the respective pool.
    </Message>
4. Once all pools are configured, click **Review** to finalize your cluster setup.

### Review configuration

1. Review the configuration details of your Kubernetes cluster and its pools.
    <Message type="tip">
      To modify any element, click the <Icon name="edit" /> **Edit** icon next to the respective configuration component.
    </Message>
2. Click **Create cluster** to deploy your cluster. Once deployment is complete, the cluster displays in the clusters list.

## How to add a Scaleway pool to a Kubernetes cluster

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the side menu. The Kubernetes dashboard displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the cluster you want to edit. Click **Add pool** in the menu. The pool configuration wizard displays.
3. This page concerns the configuration of your cluster. Enter the following information:
    - The geographical **region** of the pool.
    - The **node type** for the pool.
    - If required, configure the **pool options** like autoscaling, autohealing, or link the pool to an existing placement group.
    - The **name** for the pool. Optionally, you can assign tags to it.
4. Click **Add pool**.

## How to add a multi-cloud pool to a Kubernetes cluster

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the side menu. The Kubernetes dashboard displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the pool you want to edit. Click **Add pool** in the menu. The pool configuration wizard displays.
3. Click **Add pool**.

### How to add external nodes to a multi-cloud pool

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Kubernetes dashboard displays.
2. Click **Create cluster**. The first page of the cluster creation wizard displays. This concerns the configuration of your cluster.
3. Complete the following steps of the wizard:
    * Choose a **cluster type**. Select **Kubernetes Kosmos** to create a cluster, that allows you to attach a compute Instance or dedicated server from any Cloud provider to a Scaleway Kubernetes control plane.
      <Message type="note">
        This document concerns the creation and management of a **Kubernetes Kosmos** cluster. To create a Kubernetes Kapsule cluster, refer to the [Kubernetes Kapsule documentation](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/).
      </Message>
    * The geographical **region** of the cluster.
    * The Kubernetes **version** for the cluster.
    * A **name** for the cluster and, optionally, a description and tags.
4. Click **Create cluster** to create your cluster without any Scaleway pools.
   If you choose this option, your cluster and its control plane are deployed, and you are taken to the cluster's overview tab. Continue to [How to manage your Kubernetes Kosmos cluster](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/edit-kosmos-cluster) to find out how to add multi-cloud pools to your cluster.

   Alternatively, click **Add and configure a pool** to add a pool of Scaleway nodes to your cluster.  In this case, the second page of the cluster creation wizard displays. This concerns the settings for your pool.
5. Enter the following information to configure a Scaleway pool:
    * The **Availability Zone** in which all your pool's nodes will be created.
    * The **node type** you need.
    * The configuration for your **pool options**, including the number of nodes and whether to enable autoscale. You can also choose whether to enable autoheal and whether to link the cluster to a placement group. Alternatively, you can leave these options at default values.
6. Click **Create cluster**. Your cluster is deployed, and you are taken to the cluster’s **Overview** tab.
  <Message type="important">
    Make sure you have:
    * An `arm64` or `amd64` server running with Ubuntu or Debian, having a public IP assigned to it.
    * A Scaleway [secret key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/).

## How to delete a Kubernetes cluster

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the side menu. The Kubernetes dashboard displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> to display the options menu, then click **Delete**. A cluster deletion pop-up displays.
3. Type **DELETE** to confirm the deletion of your cluster. Tick the checkbox to automatically delete all volumes (including those with volume type “retain”) and Load Balancers whose names start with the cluster ID. Validate your choice by clicking **Delete cluster**.
    <Message type="important">
      Deleting your cluster will permanently destroy your cluster and all its associated pools and Instances. External compute resources cannot be destroyed automatically and will remain active until destroyed at the concerned cloud service provider (CSP).
