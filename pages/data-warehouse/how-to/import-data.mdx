Data federation allows you to query and combine data from multiple sources, enabling seamless analytics across different databases or storage systems without the need to move or duplicate data. With Data Warehouse for ClickHouse®'s [bottomless storage](/data-warehouse/concepts/#bottomless-storage) feature, you can decouple compute and storage, allowing your data to be stored cost-effectively in external object storage while maintaining high performance for queries.
