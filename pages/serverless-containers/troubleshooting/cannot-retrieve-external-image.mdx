## Problem

I am experiencing issues when retrieving an image stored in an external container registry.

## Cause

Serverless products support external public registries (such as [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)), but we do not recommend using them due to uncontrolled rate limiting, which can lead to failures when starting resources, unexpected usage conditions, and pricing changes.

## Solution

We recommend using the [Scaleway Container Registry](/container-registry/) instead, as it allows for a seamless integration with Serverless Containers at a [competitive price](/container-registry/faq/#how-am-i-billed-for-scaleway-container-registry).

Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/serverless-containers/api-cli/migrate-external-image-to-scaleway-registry/) for more information on how to migrate images to the Scaleway Container Registry.
