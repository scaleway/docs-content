Starting 26 November 2024 a rate limit of 20 DNS queries per second for full DNS resolutions per Container instance will be applied. This limit only applies to queries that require a full DNS resolution, and is enforced independently for each Container instance.

This rate limit is set at a level that is well above typical usage, so most users should not be impacted.
