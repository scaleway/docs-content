## Bash Scripting - Overview

[Bash](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)>) (Bourne again shell) is an improved version of Sh (Bourne shell) and is available by default on Linux and MacOS operating systems. A shell provides a command line interface (CLI) to interact with the operating system of a computer. It interprets commands in plain text format and passes the information to the operating stems to launch an action.

A Bash script is a plain text file containing a series of commands. These commands can be a mixture of commands you would normally type by yourself on the shell (like `ls` or `cd`) and other commands you would normally not type by yourself as they can be more complex. Any command available on the shell can be used in a bash script - and vice versa.

No special knowledge is required to write bash scripts, as they are plain text files containing the series of commands required to run a specific task. Instead of typing then manually on the shell, you write them in a script and run the script afterwards. This can be very useful for system administration tasks as you can automatize tasks. The common file extension for bash scripts is `*.sh`.

## Getting Started

1. Connect to your instance using [SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/)

2. Update the `apt` packet cache and the software already installed on the instance:

  ```
  apt update && apt upgrade -y
  ```

3. Create a new bash script and open it in a text editor, for example `nano`:

  ```
  nano xmas.sh
  ```

4. Copy the following content into the script:

  ```bash
  # The following line tells the shell what program to interpret the script with
  #!/bin/bash

  # tput is a command to manipulate the terminal, it can be used to change the color of text, apply effects, and generally brighten things up.
  trap "tput reset; tput cnorm; exit" 2
  clear
  tput civis
  lin=2
  col=$(($(tput cols) / 2))
  c=$((col-1))
  est=$((c-2))
  color=0

  # Set the text color to green to write the tree
  tput setaf 2; tput bold

  # Write the tree
  for ((i=1; i<40; i+=2))
  {
      tput cup $lin $col
      for ((j=1; j<=i; j++))
      {
          echo -n \*
      }
      let lin++
      let col--
  }

  ## Set the color to brown for the trunk
  tput sgr0; tput setaf 130

  # Write the Trunk in three lines
  for ((i=1; i<=3; i++))
  {
      tput cup $((lin++)) $c
      echo 'mWm'
  }

  # Write a greeting
  tput setaf 93; tput bold
  tput cup $lin $((c - 15)); echo SCALEWAY wishes you Merry Christmas
  tput cup $((lin + 1)) $((c - 11)); echo And a happy new year 2020
  let c++
  k=1

  # Configure lights and decorations
  while true; do
      for ((i=1; i<=35; i++)) {
          # Turn off the lights
          [ $k -gt 1 ] && {
              tput setaf 2; tput bold
              tput cup ${line[$[k-1]$i]} ${column[$[k-1]$i]}; echo \*
              unset line[$[k-1]$i]; unset column[$[k-1]$i]  # Array cleanup
          }

          li=$((RANDOM % 9 + 10))
          start=$((c-li+2))
          co=$((RANDOM % (li-2) * 2 + 1 + start))
          tput setaf $color; tput bold   # Switch colors
          tput cup $li $co
          echo o
          line[$k$i]=$li
          column[$k$i]=$co
          color=$(((color+1)%8))
      }
      k=$((k % 2 + 1))
  done
  ```

5. Write the file by pressing `CTRL` and `o` and exit nano by pressing `CTRL` and `x`.

6. By default plain text files are not executable. Make the script Executable using the `chmod` command:

  ```
  chmod +x xmas.sh
  ```

## Running the Script

1. Run the script from your terminal by typing the following code:

  ```
  ./xmas.sh
  ```

2. The script writes an animated tree on the terminal window:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-xmastree.gif" alt="" />

3. Exit the script by pressing `CTRL` + `c`.
