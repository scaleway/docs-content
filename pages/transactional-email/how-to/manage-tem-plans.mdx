- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Configured your domain(s) with Transactional Email](/transactional-email/how-to/configure-domain-with-transactional-email/)
- Added [SPF, DKIM](/transactional-email/how-to/add-spf-dkim-records-to-your-domain/), [MX](/transactional-email/how-to/add-mx-record-to-your-domain/) and [DMARC](/transactional-email/how-to/add-dmarc-record/) records to your domain(s)

## How to change TEM plans

When you configure a domain with Transactional Email in a Project for the first time, you are prompted to select a TEM plan between [Essential](/concepts#essential-plan) and [Scale](/concepts#scale-plan).

You can change your selected plan anytime in the Scaleway console.

1. Click **Transactional Email** in the **Managed Services** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. Your domains display.
2. Click the **Plans** tab.
3. Scroll to the **Manage your plan** section.
4. Click **Select plan** to select the plan to which you want to change. A pop-up appears.
    <Message type="important">
      - If you are upgrading to the **Scale plan** keep in mind that:
          - You will be billed a fixed monthly amount, instead of pay-as-you-go.
          - A 30-day commitment is required to ensure a progressive and effective [warm-up of the IP address](/transactional-email/concepts#ip-warm-up). If you decide to downgrade or cancel your account before the end of the commitment period, you will still be charged for the 30-day period.
      - If you are downgrading to the **Essential plan**, consider that:
          - You will lose access to your dedicated IP address and will be reverted to a shared IP. This may impact your sending speed and deliverability.
          - This will reduce the number of available webhooks
          - You will be reverted to an automatic blocklist. This means you will no longer be able to manually add emails to your blocklist.

5. Type **UPGRADE** to confirm.
