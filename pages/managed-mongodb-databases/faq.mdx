## What are the MongoDB free trial conditions?

The MongoDB free trial lasts for **30 days**.
During the trial period, you can create up to 3 free instances using the `PLAY2-NANO` node type. These can be standalone instances or 3-node replica sets. If you choose any other node type, standard pricing applies.
To be eligible for the free trial, you must not have previously ordered a Managed MongoDB instance.
When activating the trial, your first instance must use the `PLAY2-NANO` node type.
You can opt out of the free trial by unchecking the **Activate the 30-day free trial** option during setup. Note that you will no longer be eligible for the trial approximately 30 minutes after creating your first instance.

<Message type="note">
  When you activate the free trial, the console shows 29 days remaining. This is because the countdown begins immediately (technically, 29 days, 23 hours, and 59 minutes remain, but only full days are displayed).
