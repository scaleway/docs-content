All Scaleway [GPU Instances](/compute/gpu/quickstart/) come with a Nvida driver pre-installed. This means you do not have to install them by yourself.
The drivers installed on each Instance are from the `nividia-headless-<driver version>` packages. These are intended for use on cloud Instances without a Windows Desktop or display server. 

<Message type="important">
    The manual installation of a `nvidia-driver` package forces the installation of the `xorg` display server and other Gnome packages. As there is no physical display connected to the GPU of your Instance, this may cause side-effects such as your Instance entering into sleep mode after a while, resulting in the user being disconnected.
</Message>

In case you installed any `nvidia-driver-*` packages on your GPU Instance, remove them from the Instance using the `apt purge` command and make sure to install and use `nvidia-headless-*` packages instead.
