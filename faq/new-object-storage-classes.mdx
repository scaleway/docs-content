## What is the difference between the Standard class in PAR and the Standard class in AMS and WAW?
Scaleway Object Storage uses erasure code  (6+3) to secure your data, today the data is distributed across three different racks inside the same DC. In case one rack becomes unavailable, we are still able to rebuild your data. 
On FR-PAR, your data is distributed across different Availability Zones (AZ). In case of DC failure we would still be able to rebuild your data and it would be accessible. This is the system we call multi AZ (one DC, in one AZ). 
With Standard class in PAR, your data is stored across three different AZ. Standard class in AMS and WAW currently allows you to store data across one AZ. We aim to make the multi-AZ Standard available in all regions in 2022/2023.

## What is the new storage class One Zone - Infrequent Access (IA)?
With One Zone - IA, your data is across three different racks inside the same DC. This storage class is a good choice for storing secondary backup copies or easily recreatable data. 
It can also be integrated into your lifecycle management rules, along with Standard and Glacier classes.

## Will these new storage classes affect how I use my buckets?
No, any objects you upload into your buckets are added as Standard class objects by default, just as before. If you want to transfer your objects to One Zone - IA or Glacier you can do so manually or set up [lifecycle rules](/storage/object/api-cli/lifecycle-rules-api/). 

## I do not want to use the new Standard class but I have a bucket and objects in PAR. Can I still use the old class?
Unfortunately, you cannot use the old Standard class. You must use the [One Zone - IA class](/storage/object/concepts/#storage-class), available only on newly-created buckets.

## Can I create a lifecycle rule to restore objects from Glacier class to One Zone - IA?
No, because restoring an object can only be done from Glacier to Standard class. Transition lifecycle rules can only be configured in the "top-down" direction. 

This means that you can transfer objects from Standard class to One Zone - IA and Glacier, but not from the last two to Standard. You can transfer objects from One Zone - IA to Glacier, but not restore objects from Glacier to One Zone - IA. The same applies when you make server-side copies.

## Do the new storage classes impact Scaleway Glacier?
No, the rules for using Glacier class remain the same and your data is still hosted in DC4.

## Can I migrate my existing data to the new multi-AZ Standard class?
Yes, you will first need to create a new bucket and then copy your existing data into it. Follow [our documentation on how to migrate data from one bucket to another](/storage/object/api-cli/migrating-buckets) to do so. 

## I have a general question about Object Storage. Where can I find further answers?
You can find answers to your questions about the Object Storage service in our [Object Storage FAQ](/faq/objectstorage/).
