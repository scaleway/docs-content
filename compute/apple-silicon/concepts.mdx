  ## VNC

  Virtual Network Computing (VNC), is a remote desktop-sharing protocol. It allows you to visualize the graphical screen output of a remote computer and to transfer local keyboard and mouse events to the remote computer by using a network connection. The protocol is platform-independent which means that various clients exist for Linux, Windows, and macOS-based computers. The VNC server used on the M1 is directly integrated with the macOS system without any restrictions from our side. Check out our documentation on [how to connect to your Mac Mini M1 via VNC](/compute/apple-silicon/how-to/connect-to-mac-mini-m1/#how-to-connect-via-vnc).
