An IAM group is a grouping of users and/or applications. Groups allow you to attach [policies](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts#policy) to multiple users at the same time.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You are the Owner of your Organization, or an IAM user in an Organization where you have the [IAMManager or OrganizationManager](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/permission-sets) permission set. 
</Message>

1. Click **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** from the top-right of your [**Organization Dashboard**](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) in the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) displays.

3. Click the <Icon name="plus" /> button to create a new IAM group. The group creation wizard displays:

4. Complete the steps of the creation wizard:
    - Enter a **name** for the group, or use the auto-generated name suggested for you.
    - Enter a **description** (optional).
    - Add **members** to the group (optional) by first selecting the type of member you want to add (user or application) and then selecting the specific user or application from the drop-down list. Click **Add another member** and repeat the process until you have added all the members you want.
    - Attach an existing **policy** to the group (optional). The members of the group will benefit from the access rights defined in this policy. Alternatively, you can choose not to attach a policy now and do so at a later stage.
5. Click **Create group** to finish. 

    You are returned to the list of your groups, where your newly created group now appears.
