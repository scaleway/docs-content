Scaleway's [Serverless Functions](https://www.scaleway.com/en/serverless-functions/) platform makes your [functions](/serverless/functions/concepts/#function) available, executes them on demand and manages resource allocation for you.  

This page explains how to deploy, invoke and delete a basic Node, Python, or PHP function using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com). For advanced usage, such as larger projects with dependencies, automation, multiple functions and more, [many ways to deploy functions](/serverless/functions/reference-content/deploy-function/) are available.

Check out our [scaleway/serverless-examples repository](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-examples) for advanced examples and use cases.

## How to create a function

If you have no existing Serverless Functions resources in your current Project, the creation process will guide you through the creation of a namespace, and then a function.

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.

2. Click **+ Create a function**. The function [namespace](/serverless/functions/concepts/#namespace) creation wizard displays.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 
    - Enter a **name** or use the automatically generated one. The name can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes.
    - Enter a **description** (optional). 
    - Choose a **region**, which is the geographical location in which your namespace will be deployed.
4. Click **Create namespace and add function**. The function creation wizard displays.

      Refer to the [How to create a Functions namespace](/serverless/functions/how-to/create-a-functions-namespace/) documentation page for more information on the different parameters.

5. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Choose either **Node**, **Python** or **PHP** as a runtime.
    - Select **Deploy "Hello world"** if you want to deploy a basic function, or select **Inline code editor** to enter your own function code.
    - If you used the code editor, enter the **handler** of your function.
    - Enter a **name** or use the automatically generated one. The name can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes.
    - Enter a **description** (optional).
    - Choose the smallest **resources** available to allocate to your function.
    - Leave the default **scaling** values.
    - In the **Advanced options**, set the **Function privacy policy** to **public**.
    - Verify the **estimated cost**.

6. Click **Create function**. The deployment takes several minutes to complete. Check the **Overview** tab to see the function's status.

7. Copy the function's endpoint URL from the **Overview** tab.

8. Run the following command in your terminal to invoke your function once it is deployed:

    ```bash
    curl <YOUR_FUNCTION_ENDPOINT>
    ```

## How to delete a function

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.

2. Click the relevant functions namespace.

3. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the function you want to delete, and select **Delete** from the drop-down menu.

4. Type **DELETE** in the pop-up that asks you to confirm the action, then click **Delete function**.

  You can also delete a function from the [Function settings tab](/serverless/functions/how-to/manage-a-functions-namespace/).
