Your RPNv1 gateway may differ from one Dedibox to another for techical reasons.
It is normally pushed by DHCP, and and configured automatically.
However, in some cases you may need to know the details of the gateway.

You can find the RPNv1 gateway for your Dedibox in [rescue mode](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/use-rescue-mode/).

<Message type="requirement">

* You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net)
* You have a [Dedibox dedicated server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/) with RPN interface

</Message>

1. Reboot your Dedibox into [rescue mode](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/use-rescue-mode/). 

  <Message type="important">

  Applications hosted on the Dedibox become unavailable while your server is in rescue mode. 

  </Message>

2. Run the `ip route show` command to display your RPNv1 gateway. An output as the following displays:

  ```
  # ip route show
  10.90.0.0/XX via X.X.X.X ...
  ```
  The output contains the following information:
  * `10.90.0.0/XX`: Your RPNv1 IP subnet. The part after the `/` represents the [CIDR netmask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) of your subnet. 
  * `X.X.X.X`: The IP address of the gateway. The gateway is always the first IP of the subnet.

  <Message type="note">

  The gateway does not ping, this is normal behavior.

  </Message>

<Message type="tip">

If you know your RPN netmask, you can also find your gateway from normal mode by using `ipcalc`. 

  * Run the following command to calculate the IP address of your RPNv1 gateway:

  ```
  # ipcalc -b [SET_HERE_YOUR_RPN_IP]/[CIDR_NETMASK] | grep HostMin
  HostMin: X.X.X.X
  ```

  The gateway is located at the IP address in place of `X.X.X.X`.
