## CIDR block

A **C**lassless **I**nter-**D**omain **R**outing (CIDR) block represents a range of IP addresses. They all share the same network prefix. An example of an [IPv4](#ipv4) CIDR block is `172.16.16.0/22`, while an [IPv6](#ipv6) CIDR block looks like `fd12:3456:789a:1::/64`.

The two parts of a CIDR block are:
- The **prefix**, which represents an IP address.
- The **suffix**, which consists of a slash and a number that represents the network size. This is also known as the prefix length or subnet mask bit size. It states how many bits of the prefix/IP address are used to designate the network itself, with the remaining bits therefore being available to designate specific hosts on the network.

An IPv4 CIDR block and an IPv6 CIDR block are defined for each Scaleway Private Network at the time of creation. When you attach a resource (e.g. an Instance, an Elastic Metal server or a Load Balancer) to the network, [DHCP](#dhcp) will assign one IPv4 and (if the resource is IPv6-compatible) one IPv6 address from the designated blocks to that resource. This way, each resource automatically gets a private IPv4 and IPv6 address on the Private Network.

IP addresses from within a given subnet (that is to say, allocated from a certain CIDR block that is used for a certain Private Network) display with a slash at the end. In the case of an IPv4 address, this could look like `172.16.16.2/22`. This format encapsulates information both about the IP address itself, and which subnet it is from. If you configure an Instance manually with this address, it sets both the correct IP and a route to the correct subnet.
