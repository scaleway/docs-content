Monitoring your dedicated servers with [Scaleway Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/quickstart/) offers detailed information about performance and health, ensuring optimal functionality and proactive issue resolution.

Cockpit provides a user-friendly interface for real-time monitoring of CPU, memory, disk usage, and network activity, enhancing the reliability and performance of bare metal servers.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Elastic Metal](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/quickstart/) or [Dedibox](/bare-metal/dedibox/quickstart/) server running on a Linux operating system

<Message type="important">
* Having the default configuration on your agents might lead to more of your resources’ metrics being sent, a high consumption and a high bill at the end of the month.
* Sending metrics and logs for Scaleway resources or personal data using an external path is a billable feature.  In addition, any data that you push yourself is billed, even if you send data from Scaleway products. Refer to the [product pricing](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/?tags=available,managedservices-observability-cockpit) for more information.

## Accessing Cockpit

1. Create a token with the `push` permission for metrics/logs to Cockpit by following the instructions provided [in the dedicated documentation](/observability/cockpit/how-to/create-token/).
2. Configure the Grafana Agent to push metrics/logs to Cockpit. Refer to the [official documentation](/observability/cockpit/api-cli/configuring-grafana-agent/) for detailed instructions.
    <Message type="tip">
        For efficient cost management and near real-time resource monitoring, it is recommended to set the interval to 1 minute.

3. [Retrieve your Grafana credentials](/observability/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/), then use them to [access your Cockpit dashboards](/observability/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards/).

## Importing dashboards

To monitor your bare metal servers, you can import pre-configured dashboards from the Grafana dashboard repository. One such dashboard is the Node Exporter Full dashboard, offering detailed server metrics. Follow these steps to import it:

1. Visit the [Node Exporter Full dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/12486-node-exporter-full/) on the Grafana dashboard repository.
2. Copy the dashboard ID by clicking **Copy ID**.
3. In Cockpit, navigate to the **Dashboards** section.
4. Click **Import** and paste the copied dashboard ID.
5. Follow the prompts to complete the import process.

This process allows you to push metrics and logs to Scaleway’s Cockpit (Grafana) and monitor your Elastic Metal servers with real-time tracking of their health and performance.
