Messaging and Queuing SQS now includes support for JSON transport protocol 1.0, which serves as the default transport for the latest SQS SDK. Feel free to upgrade your SDK to the most recent version.

The query protocol remains a supported option and you have the flexibility to use the SDK's earlier versions or a custom implementation using the query transport protocol.
