## Default Project

Each [Organization](#organization) must have at least one associated [Project](#project), and at the time of account creation this Project is called **default**. The default Project takes on the Organization ID. Therefore, the default status cannot be transferred to other Projects, nor can the default Project's name be altered.

## Organization Quotas

Every [Organization](#organization) has quotas, which are limits on the number of Scaleway resources they can use. Quotas are per product (eg Instances) and product type (eg GP1-L instance). Quotas are designed to prevent abuse, and can be viewed on the [Organization Account page](https://console.scaleway.com/account/organization/profile) of the console.

## Project Dashboard

The Project Dashboard can be viewed within the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/project). On this dashboard you can see an overview of the Project's [resources](#resources), along with the Project's settings and [credentials](#credentials)

## SSH Key

An SSH Key (**S**ecure **Sh**ell Key) allows passwordless connection to an [Instance](/compute/instances/concepts/#instance). An SSH Key is generated by creating an RSA key pair, consisting of two elements:

- a sensitive **identification key**, (aka private key) which must be stored securely
- a **public key** which is uploaded to the Scaleway interface.

The public key is kept in your Scaleway account and transferred to the Instance during the boot process, while the identification key is kept securely on your local computer. When connecting to the Instance via SSH, a trusted connection to the machine is established using the key pair.
