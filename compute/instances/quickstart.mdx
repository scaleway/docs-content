Scaleway [Instances](/compute/instances/concepts/#instance) are computing units which provide you with resources to run your applications. After you have created your Instance and installed your image of choice (e.g. an operating system), you can connect to it via SSH to use it as you wish. When you are done using the Instance, you can delete it from your account.

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created your SSH key and added it to your account](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)

## How to create an Instance

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Instance creation page displays.

2. Click **Create an Instance**. The Instance creation wizard displays.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 

    - Choose an **Availability Zone**, which is the geographical region where your Instance will be deployed.
    - Choose an **Image** to run on your Instance. This can be an operating system, an InstantApp or a custom image. A complete list of all available Linux distributions and InstantApps can be found [here](https://www.scaleway.com/en/imagehub/).

    <Message type="note">

      When choosing an image for an Enterprise Instance, be aware this Instance type is not compatible with bootscripts, except for [rescue mode](/compute/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes#how-to-use-rescue-mode). InstantApps are also not available for this Instance type.

    </Message>

    - Choose an **Instance type**. Different Instance types have different prices, processing power, memory, SSD disks and bandwidth. 
    - Add **Volumes**. Volumes are storage spaces used by your Instances. 
      - For **GP1 Instances** you can leave the default settings of a maximum local storage, or choose how much [local](/compute/instances/concepts#local-volumes) and/or [block](/compute/instances/concepts#block-volumes) storage you want. Your **system volume** is the volume on which your Instance will boot. The system volume can be either a local or a block volume.
      - **PRO2** and **Enterprise** Instances boot directly [on block volumes](/compute/instances/concepts/#boot-on-block). You can add several block volumes and define how much storage you want for each. 
    
    <Message type="important">

    Please note that:  
      - a volume with an OS image should be at least 10GB (125GB for a GPU OS).
      - if several Block Storage volumes are connected to your Instance, the first volume will contain the OS and is required to boot the Instance. You can [change your boot volume](/compute/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes/#how-to-change-the-boot-volume) after you create the Instance.
      - if you have two or more volumes with identical operating systems, or a volume with no operating system, choosing one of these as your boot volume may cause unpredictable boot behavior. 

    </Message>

    - Enter a **Name** for your Instance, or leave the randomly-generated name in place. Optionally, you can also add [tags](/compute/instances/concepts#tags) to help you organize your Instances. 
    - Click **Advanced Options** if you want to configure a [flexible IP](/compute/instances/concepts#flexible-ip), a local bootscript or a [cloud-init configuration](/compute/instances/concepts#cloud-init). Otherwise, leave these options at their default values. 
    - Verify the [SSH Keys](/console/my-account/concepts#ssh-key) that will give you access to your Instance.
    - Verify the **Estimated Cost** of your Instance, based on the specifications you chose.

4. Click **Create a new Instance** to create your Instance. You will be informed when the Instance is ready.


## How to Connect to an Instance

### How to connect from OSX (Mac) and Linux

1. Open a terminal program.

2. Enter the command below into the terminal. Make sure you replace `your_private_key` with the filename of your private key (often `id_rsa`) and `your_instance_ip` with the IP address of your Instance.

  ```sh
  ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_private_key root@your_instance_ip
  ```

  <Message type="important">

    If you use `bash` as your default shell replace "sh" with "bash" when entering the previous command.

  </Message>

3. If / when prompted, allow connection to the host by typing `yes`, then press **Enter**.
  ```
  The authenticity of host 'myhost.ext (212.47.226.35)' can't be established.
  RSA key fingerprint is 4f:ba:65:cf:14:64:a7:1e:b6:07:7c:00:71:95:21:fa.
  Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
  ```

You are now connected to your Instance.

### How to connect from Windows

To connect to your Instance from Windows, you will need to use a small application called **PuTTy**, an SSH client.

1. Download and install PuTTy [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)

2. Launch PuTTy on your computer.

3. Enter your Instance's IP address in the **Hostname** field.

4. In the side menu, under **Connection** navigate to the **Auth** sub-category. (**Connection** --> **SSH** --> **Auth**)

5. Click the **Browse** button and select the private key file you [generated previously](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/).

6. Click **Open** at the bottom of the screen to open a connection to the Instance. PuttY asks you to allow the connection to the host.

7. Click **OK** to confirm. The terminal window diplays.

8. Enter the username `root` and press **Enter** to authenticate against the server with your SSH key.

You are now connected to your Instance.


## How to Delete an Instance

<Message type="important">

  Deleting an Instance will destroy all the volumes and data stored on that Instance. Note that your Instance must be powered off or stopped to be deleted.

</Message>

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Instances page displays.

2. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the Instance you want to delete, and select **Delete** from the drop-down menu. A pop-up asks you to confirm the action.

3. Type **DELETE** and then click **Delete this Instance**.
