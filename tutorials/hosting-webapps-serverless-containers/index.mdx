import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Installed [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) or [Docker Egine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Created a Scaleway Container Registry namespace](/container-registry/how-to/create-namespace/) and [logged into it](/container-registry/how-to/connect-docker-cli/)

## Create and host a basic Next.js web application

To host a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) web app on Serverless Containers, you must create a Next.js project, implement your pages and any API routes, and add a production-ready Dockerfile that builds and serves the app — either by running a Node server with `next build && next start` or by exporting static files with `next export` if your app is fully static. Build the container image locally, push it to the [Scaleway Container Registry](/container-registry/), and deploy it to [Scaleway Serverless Containers](/serverless-containers/).

### Create your app and test it locally

1. In a terminal, run the command below to create a new folder and access it:

    ```bash
    mkdir my-nextjs-app
    cd my-nextjs-app
    ```

2. Run the command below to create an example Next.js application using the default template. You can also use an example from the [official Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples).

    ```bash
    npx create-next-app@latest my-nextjs-app
    ```

3. When prompted, configure your app according to your needs, or keep the default values to start quickly. Next.js will then create an app with a folder structure similar to the following:

    ```
    my-nextjs-app/
    ├── app/                     # Core: Routes using the App Router
    │   ├── layout.tsx           # Root layout (shared across pages)
    │   ├── page.tsx             # Homepage (http://localhost:3000)
    │   └── globals.css          # Global styles
    │
    ├── public/                  # Static assets (served at /)
    │   ├── logo.svg
    │   └── favicon.ico
    │
    ├── components/              # (Optional) Your reusable components
    │   └── ...
    │
    ├── styles/                  # (Optional) CSS modules or theme files
    │   └── ...
    │
    ├── next.config.js           # Next.js configuration file
    ├── tailwind.config.js       # If you chose Tailwind
    ├── postcss.config.js        # PostCSS setup (used with Tailwind)
    ├── package.json             # Dependencies and scripts
    ├── package-lock.json        # Locked dependencies
    ├── .gitignore               # Git ignore rules
    └── README.md                # Auto-generated docs
    ```

4. Run the command below to run your application locally:

    ```bash
    cd my-nextjs-app
    npm run dev
    ```

    Access [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the homepage of your web app.

### Build the app image and push it to Scaleway Container Registry

Before creating and pushing your image to the registry, make sure you have [Created a Scaleway Container Registry namespace](/container-registry/how-to/create-namespace/) and [logged into it](/container-registry/how-to/connect-docker-cli/).

1. Create a new `dockerfile` file at the root of your app folder, then add the following code to it:

    ```dockerfile
    # Build the Next.js app
    FROM node:18-alpine
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY package*.json ./
    RUN npm install
    COPY . .
    RUN npm run build

    # Expose port and run server
    EXPOSE 3000
    CMD ["npm", "start"]
    ```

2. Run the command below to build, tag, and push your image to the Scaleway Container registry:

    ```bash
    docker build \
    --platform linux/amd64 \
    --push \
    -t <CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT>/my-nextjs-app:latest .
    ```

    <Message type="note">
    You can find your Container Registry endpoint in the **Settings** tab of your Container Registry Endpoint in the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/registry/namespaces)
    </Message>

### Deploy your app using Serverless Containers

1. [Deploy a Serverless Container](/serverless-containers/how-to/deploy-container/) with the following parameters:

    - **Registry**: Scaleway Container Registry
    - **Registry namespace**: the Container Registry namespace you pushed your image to.
    - **Container port**: `3000` as it is the [port](/serverless-containers/reference-content/port-parameter-variable/) exposed in the dockerfile.
    - **Resources**: `1000 mVCPU` and `1024 MB` memory
    - **Autoscaling**: set a minimum scale of `1` to avoid [cold starts](/serverless-containers/concepts/#cold-start) (optional).

    The deployment of your container can take up to a minute to complete.

2. Once your container is **ready**, click the **container endpoint** from its **Overview** tab. Your web page displays, and is available to anyone with the link.

## Going further

- You can deploy an already existing app by building its image and pushing it to the Scaleway Container registry as explained above.
- You can [add a custom domain](/serverless-containers/how-to/add-a-custom-domain-to-a-container/) name to your website.
