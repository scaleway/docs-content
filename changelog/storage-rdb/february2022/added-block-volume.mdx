Thanks to this feature, you can:

* Change storage and node size independently to optimize your costs and adapt to your application's traffic.
* Scale up your storage volume from 5GB to 10TB with no downtime.
* Make Snapshots of your data in seconds for any size of the volume and recover a previous state of your data in case of accidental data alteration.
