Each function comes with an automatically generated domain on which it is available. However, it is possible to assign your own domain name to make it easier to use your functions.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have a running [Serverless Function](/serverless/functions/how-to/create-a-function/)
  - You have a domain name
  - If you are using **Cloudflare DNS**, refer to [the section below](#cloudflare-dns)
</Message>

1. On your domain provider's platform (for example [Scaleway's domains](/network/domains-and-dns/how-to/manage-dns-records/)), add a CNAME record pointing to your function default URL in the domain's DNS zone file.

    <Message type="note">
      - All domains are supported.
      - CNAME flattening is supported. [CNAME flattening](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cname-flattening-rfc-compliant-cnames-at-a-domains-root/) speeds up CNAME resolution and allows you to use a CNAME record at your root/apex domain.
      - If your DNS provider does not support CNAME flattening, you need to create an ALIAS on your root domain (named `@` or with an empty name) instead of a CNAME.
    </Message>
2. Click the **Endpoints** tab on your functions' page.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-functions-domain.webp" alt="" />
3. Click **+ Add endpoint**.
4. Enter your custom domain name and validate the form.
5. The console runs checks on the CNAME and TLS configuration of the custom domain name. Connect to your function using your custom domain once all checks have completed.

<Message type="important">
  **Custom Domains** do not currently support websockets. If you need to use websockets, you must configure them with the original container URL.

## Cloudflare DNS

If you are using Cloudflare DNS to configure your custom domain, you must set the `CNAME` record's proxy status to **DNS Only** while adding it to your function. We perform a number of validation checks on our side when configuring your domain, and if the `CNAME` record is proxied during these checks, the checks will fail.

Once you have configured your domain and your function is responding correctly, you can set the `CNAME` record back to `Proxied` if you wish.

The [Cloudflare documentation on Proxy Status](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/) describes how to change the Proxy Status of a `CNAME` record via the Cloudflare web UI.
