## Prometheus - Overview

This tutorial explains how to use a Prometheus Monitoring server with a Grafana dashboard.

[Prometheus](https://www.prometheus.io/) is a flexible monitoring solution that is in development since 2012. The software stores all its data in a time series database and offers a multi-dimensional data-model and a powerful query language to generate reports of the monitored resources.

</Message>

## Preparing your environment

In this tutorial, we use an Instance running on [Ubuntu Focal Fossa (20.04))](https://www.ubuntu.com/).

1. To run Prometheus safely on our server, we have to create a user for Prometheus and Node Exporter without the possibility to log in.
   To achieve this, we use the parameter `--no-create-home` which skips the creation of a home directory and disable the shell with `--shell /usr/sbin/nologin`.

  ```sh
  sudo useradd --no-create-home --shell /usr/sbin/nologin prometheus
  sudo useradd --no-create-home --shell /bin/false node_exporter
  ```

2. Create the folders required to store the binaries of Prometheus and its configuration files:

  ```sh
  sudo mkdir /etc/prometheus
  sudo mkdir /var/lib/prometheus
  ```

3. Set the ownership of these directories to our `prometheus` user, to make sure that Prometheus can access to these folders:

  ```sh
  sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus
  sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /var/lib/prometheus
  ```

## Downloading and installing Node Exporter

As your Prometheus is only capable of collecting metrics, we want to extend its capabilities by adding **Node Exporter**, a tool that collects information about the system including [CPU, disk, and memory usage](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter#enabled-by-default) and exposes them for scraping.

1. Download the latest version of Node Exporter:

  ```sh
  wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.3.1/node_exporter-1.3.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
  ```

2. Unpack the downloaded archive. This will create a directory `node_exporter-1.3.1.linux-amd64`, containing the executable, a readme and license file:

  ```sh
  tar xvf node_exporter-1.3.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
  ```

3. Copy the binary file into the directory `/usr/local/bin` and set the ownership to the user you have created in step previously:
   ```sh
   sudo cp node_exporter-1.3.1.linux-amd64/node_exporter /usr/local/bin
   sudo chown node_exporter:node_exporter /usr/local/bin/node_exporter
   ```

4. Remove the leftover files of Node Exporter, as they are not needed any longer:

  ```sh
  rm -rf node_exporter-1.3.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz node_exporter-1.3.1.linux-amd64
  ```

5. To run Node Exporter automatically on each boot, a Systemd service file is required. Create the following file by opening it in Nano:
   ```sh
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/node_exporter.service
   ```

6. Copy the following information in the service file, save it and exit Nano:
    ```sh
  [Unit]
  Description=Node Exporter
  Wants=network-online.target
  After=network-online.target

  [Service]
  User=node_exporter
  Group=node_exporter
  Type=simple
  ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/node_exporter

  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target
  ```

7. Collectors are used to gather information about the system. By default a set of collectors is activated. You can see the details about the set in the [README-file](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/blob/master/README.md#enabled-by-default). If you want to use a specific set of collectors, you can define them in the `ExecStart` section of the service. Collectors are enabled by providing a` --collector.<name>` flag. Collectors that are enabled by default can be disabled by providing a `--no-collector.<name>` flag.

8. Reload Systemd to use the newly defined service:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  ```

9. Run Node Exporter by typing the following command:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl start node_exporter
  ```

10. Verify that the software has been started successfully:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl status node_exporter
  ```

  You will see an output like this, showing you the status `active (running)` as well as the main PID of the application:

  ```sh
  ● node_exporter.service - Node Exporter
      Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/node_exporter.service; disabled; vendo>
      Active: active (running) since Tue 2022-03-01 13:10:40 UTC; 11s ago
    Main PID: 21976 (node_exporter)
        Tasks: 4 (limit: 2335)
      Memory: 2.3M
      CGroup: /system.slice/node_exporter.service
              └─21976 /usr/local/bin/node_exporter
  ```

11. If everything is working, enable Node Exporter to be started on each boot of the server:
    ```sh
    sudo systemctl enable node_exporter
    ```

## Downloading and installing Prometheus

1. Download and unpack [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/download/) latest release of Prometheus. Here, the version is 2.3.1:

  ```sh
  sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
  wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.3.1/prometheus-2.3.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
  tar xfz prometheus-*.tar.gz
  cd prometheus-2.3.1.linux-amd64/
  ```

  The following two binaries are in the directory:

    - Prometheus - Prometheus main binary file
    - promtool

  The following two folders (which contain the web interface, configuration files examples and the license) are in the directory:

    - consoles
    - console_libraries

2. Copy the binary files into the `/usr/local/bin/`directory:

  ```sh
  sudo cp ./prometheus /usr/local/bin/
  sudo cp ./promtool /usr/local/bin/
  ```

3. Set the ownership of these files to the `prometheus` user previously created:

  ```sh
  sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /usr/local/bin/prometheus
  sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /usr/local/bin/promtool
  ```

4. Copy the `consoles` and `console_libraries` directories to `/etc/prometheus`:

  ```sh
  sudo cp -r ./consoles /etc/prometheus
  sudo cp -r ./console_libraries /etc/prometheus
  ```

5. Set the ownership of the two folders, as well as of all files that they contain, to our `prometheus` user:

  ```sh
  sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/consoles
  sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/console_libraries
  ```

6. In our home folder, remove the source files that are not needed anymore:

  ```sh
  cd .. && rm -rf prometheus-\*
  ```

## Configuring Prometheus

Prior to using Prometheus, it needs basic configuring. Thus, we need to create a configuration file named `prometheus.yml`

<Message type="note">

The configuration file of Prometheus is written in [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/start.html) which strictly forbids to use tabs. If your file is incorrectly formatted, Prometheus will not start. Be careful when you edit it.

</Message>

1. Open the file `prometheus.yml` in a text editor:

    ```sh
    sudo nano /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    ```

    Prometheus' configuration file is divided into three parts: `global`, `rule_files`, and `scrape_configs`.

    In the `global` part we can find the general configuration of Prometheus: `scrape_interval` defines how often Prometheus scrapes targets, `evaluation_interval` controls how often the software will evaluate rules. Rules are used to create new time series and for the generation of alerts.

    The `rule_files` block contains information of the location of any rules we want the Prometheus server to load.

    The last block of the configuration file is named `scape_configs` and contains the information which resources Prometheus monitors.

    Our file should look like this example:

    ```
    global:
      scrape_interval:     15s
      evaluation_interval: 15s

    rule_files:
      # - "first.rules"
      # - "second.rules"

    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'prometheus'
        scrape_interval: 5s
        static_configs:
          - targets: ['localhost:9090']
    ```

    The global `scrape_interval` is set to 15 seconds which is enough for most use cases.

    We do not have any `rule_files` yet, so the lines are commented out and start with a `#`.

    In the `scrape_configs` part we have defined our first exporter. It is Prometheus that monitors itself. As we want to have more
    precise information about the state of our Prometheus server we reduced the `scrape_interval` to 5 seconds for this job.
    The parameters `static_configs`and `targets` determine where the exporters are running. In our case it is the same server, so we use `localhost` and the port `9090`.

    As Prometheus scrapes only exporters that are defined in the `scrape_configs` part of the configuration file, we have to add Node Exporter to the file, as we did for Prometheus itself.

    We add the following part below the configuration for scrapping Prometheus:

    ```
    - job_name: 'node_exporter'
      scrape_interval: 5s
      static_configs:
        - targets: ['localhost:9100']
    ```

    Overwrite the global scrape interval again and set it to 5 seconds. As we are scarping the data from the same server as Prometheus is running on, we can use `localhost` with the default port of Node Exporter: `9100`.

    If you want to scrape data from a remote host, you have to replace `localhost` with the IP address of the remote server.

    <Message type="tip">

    For all information about the configuration of Prometheus, you may check the [configuration documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/).

    </Message>

2. Set the ownership of the file to our `Prometheus` user:

  ```sh
  sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
  ```

Our Prometheus server is ready to run for the first time.

## Running Prometheus

1. Start Prometheus directly from the command line with the following command, which executes the binary file as our `Prometheus` user:

  ```sh
  sudo -u prometheus /usr/local/bin/prometheus --config.file /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml --storage.tsdb.path /var/lib/prometheus/ --web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles --web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries
  ```

  The server starts displaying multiple status messages and the information that the server has started:

  ```sh
  level=info ts=2022-03-01T13:16:52.918475753Z caller=main.go:222 msg="Starting Prometheus" version="(version=2.3.1, branch=HEAD, revision=188ca45bd85ce843071e768d855722a9d9dabe03)"

  level=info ts=2022-03-01T13:16:52.951124437Z caller=main.go:500 msg="Server is ready to receive web requests."
  ```

2. Open your browser and type `http://IP.OF.YOUR.SERVER:9090` to access the Prometheus interface. If everything is working, we end the task by pressing on `CTRL + C` on our keyboard.

  <Message type="note">

  If you get an error message when you start the server, double check your configuration file for possible YAML syntax errors. The error message will tell you what to check.

  </Message>

3. The server is working now, but it cannot yet be launched automatically at boot. To achieve this, we have to create a new `systemd` configuration file that will tell your OS which services should it launch automatically during the boot process.

  ```sh
  sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service
  ```

  The service file tells `systemd` to run Prometheus as `prometheus` and specifies the path of the configuration files.

4. Copy the following information in the file and save it, then exit the editor:

  ```sh
  [Unit]
  Description=Prometheus Monitoring
  Wants=network-online.target
  After=network-online.target

  [Service]
  User=prometheus
  Group=prometheus
  Type=simple
  ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/prometheus \
  --config.file /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
  --storage.tsdb.path /var/lib/prometheus/ \
  --web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles \
  --web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries
  ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID

  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target
  ```

5. To use the new service, reload `systemd`:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  ```

  We enable the service so that it will be loaded automatically during boot:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl enable prometheus
  ```

6. Start Prometheus:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl start prometheus
  ```

Your Prometheus server is ready to be used.

We have now installed Prometheus to monitor your instance.

## Prometheus Web Interface

Prometheus provides a basic web server running on `http://your.server.ip:9000` that provide access to the data collected by the software.

We can verify the status of our Prometheus server from the interface:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-prometheus_targets.webp" alt="" />

Moreover, do some queries in the data that has been collected.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-prometheus_graph.webp" alt="" />

The interface is very lightweight, and the Prometheus team recommend to use a tool like [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) if you want to do more than testing and debugging the installation.

## Installing Grafana

1. Install Grafana on our instance which queries our Prometheus server.

  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install -y adduser libfontconfig1
  wget https://dl.grafana.com/oss/release/grafana_8.4.2_amd64.deb
  sudo dpkg -i grafana_8.4.2_amd64.deb
  ```

2. Enable the automatic start of Grafana by `systemd`:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable grafana-server && sudo systemctl start grafana-server
  ```

Grafana is running now, and we can connect to it at `http://your.server.ip:3000`. The default user and password is `admin` / `admin`.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-grafana_dashboard.webp" alt="" />

Now you have to create a Prometheus data source:

- Click the Grafana logo to open the sidebar.
- Click "Data Sources" in the sidebar.
- Choose "Add New".
- Select "Prometheus" as the data source.
- Set the Prometheus server URL (in our case: http://localhost:9090/)
- Click "Add" to test the connection and to save the new data source.

Your settings should look like this:

<Lightbox src="scaleway-grafana_datasource.webp" alt="" />

You are now ready to create your first dashboard from the information collected by Prometheus. You can also import some dashboards from a collection of [shared dashboards](https://grafana.com/dashboards?dataSource=prometheus)

Here is an example of a Dashboard that uses the CPU usage of our node and presents it in Grafana:

<Lightbox src="scaleway-grafana_stats.webp" alt="" />

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we were able to configure a Prometheus server with two data collectors that are scraped by our Prometheus server which provides the data to build Dashboards with Grafana. Don't hesitate to consult the official documentation of [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) and [Grafana](http://docs.grafana.org/).
