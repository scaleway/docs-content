<Message type="important">
  This documentation applies to the legacy domain product previously offered by Online.net. For managing your domain names with the latest features, we recommend using Scaleway's [Domains and DNS](/docs/network/domains-and-dns/quickstart/) service.

You must always ensure that the contact information for the domain owner is accurate and correct. You are prompted to provide and/or check contact details when you are ordering or renewing your domain. It is your responsibility to keep this information up-to-date after that. This document shows you how to check and modify this information.

<Message type="important">
  If you wish to change details about the ownerâ€™s identity, such as full name(s) or corporate name, you must complete the [change of owner/applicant](/dedibox-network/domains/how-to/change-ownership/) process via the [console](https://console.online.net/fr/domain/trade).
