This page shows you how to enable Scaleway's regionalized alert manager, and add notification contacts that will be notified when your alerts are triggered, using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/).

You can [add]() or manage contacts at any time to ensure the right people are notified when alerts fire.

<Requirements />

  - A Scaleway account logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to configure alert notifications

Enabling Scaleway's regionalized alert manager allows you configure preconfigured alerts for your Scaleway resources.

1. Click **Cockpit** in the **Monitoring** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Cockpit** overview page displays.
2. Click the **Alerts** tab.
3. Click the **Region** drop-down and select the desired region.
      <Message type="important">
        Make sure that you select the same region as the [data sources](/cockpit/concepts/#data-sources) you want to be alerted for.
      </Message>
5. Click **Enable alert manager** under the **Alert manager** section. A pop-up displays prompting you to configure alert notifications.
      <Message type="tip">
       Configuring alert notifications consists of two steps:
        - Enabling the alert manager, and
        - Adding contacts
       This allows you to receive notifications at the desired contact whenever alerts you may have configured are triggered.
      </Message>
6. Click **Enable alert manager** to confirm. The step for adding contacts displays.
  <Message type="note">
   You are prompted to create contacts when enabling the alert manager for the first time, or when re-enabling it after disabling. However, you can also [add](/cockpit/how-to/add-contact-points/) or update contacts independently from the alert manager configuration at any time.
  </Message>
7. Enter an email address, then click **+ Add email**. Your email address displays and by default, the **Resolved notifications** box is ticked. This means that you will receive notifications for resolved alerts.
8. Optionally:
    - Click **Skip for now** if you do not want to add contacts yet, or
    - Enter another email and click **+ Add email** to add another contact and/or
    - Untick the box next to the email(s) you have added if you do not wish to receive notifications for resolved alerts
9. Click **Add contacts** to confirm. A new **Contacts** section displays.
