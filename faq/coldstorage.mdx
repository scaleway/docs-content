## Is there a free tier on Scaleway Glacier?

Yes, there is a free tier and you can benefit from 75 GB of storage in Glacier class for free with no time limit. In addition, you can also benefit from  75 GB of storage and 75 GB of outgoing and inter-regional transfer in Object Storage’s standard class.

## How much do I pay to archive objects to Glacier or to restore them to Standard class?

Nothing. Switching the object class from `STANDARD` to `GLACIER` is free.
Restoring objects from `GLACIER` to `STANDARD` is also free of charge.

## I have started the restoration of an object, why is it not available instantaneously?

An object stored in Glacier class is listed but cannot be downloaded instantly. It needs to be restored to Standard class first.
This is the principle of Scaleway Glacier. Objects are stored on a cluster that is not always up and running. The restoration of objects usually takes a few minutes.

For more information, refer to this [documentation page](/storage/object/how-to/edit-storage-class/).

## When should I use Glacier class instead of Standard class?

It depends on how you will use Object Storage. If you consider that a 3-month-old object is rarely used but still has a value, you might want to send it to the Glacier class, for example.

## Can I upload an object directly to Glacier?

Yes, you can select the storage class (`STANDARD` or `GLACIER`) when uploading objects using the Scaleway console. It is also possible to do so using the API. For more information, refer to our [feature documentation](/storage/object/how-to/edit-storage-class/). 

## Why are Glacier objects stored in Paris DC4? Is it accessible from buckets in all locations?

Our Paris underground databunker (DC4) provides an increased layer of security by being 25 meters deep below the surface in a bunker where the Glacier storage class cluster is available.
This storage cluster is available from any bucket in Paris and Amsterdam and all objects can change the storage class to Glacier.

It is not yet possible to transfer files to Glacier in Warsaw, Poland.

## When are lifecycle management rules applied?

The expiration & transition rules are implemented every day at midnight UTC, but the actual action might take between one minute and twenty-four hours* after implementation.

For example, a user wants to configure a lifecycle rule that moves an object after two days to Glacier:

- Lifecycle Rules are checked everyday at midnight.
- The user uploaded a file on April 6th, at 2:00 pm UTC.
- The rule is triggered on April 8th, at 11:59 pm UTC.
- The application of the rule can take up to 24 hours
⇒ The object will be transferred to Glacier no later than 11:59 pm UTC on April 9th.

<Message type="note">

When a LifeCycle rule is set for a very large amount of objects (several 100000s) simultaneously, the rule might take longer to be applied.

## How do I encrypt my data?

For increased security, we recommend encrypt your data before sending it to Scaleway Glacier.
Encryption should be done on the client-side to guarantee that there is no evidence of your private key stored on the cluster.
Data can be encrypted using third-party solutions, like GPG. It is possible to automatize your backups and to encrypt them using a solution like Duplicity or Rclone using the crypt backend.

## Can I manage my storage and archiving constraints related to the GDPR with Scaleway Glacier?

The GDPR requires that the life span of data be defined in two distinct cases:
- The deletion of data after a certain period of time
- The archiving of data that must legally be kept
Lifecycle management features meet both of these requirements by allowing you to set a timeframe beyond which your data are archived or deleted.

## What is the maximum data volume and object size supported by Scaleway Glacier?

There is no maximum data size, Glacier accepts an unlimited number of objects up to 5 TB each. 
Large objects can be uploaded using [multipart uploads](/storage/object/api-cli/multipart-uploads/).

## Why is Scaleway Glacier technology much more reliable than tape storage technologies?

Firstly, Scaleway Glacier’s hard disk drive-based technology offers much better random data access time. 
In fact, it takes only a few milliseconds to access your data, whereas access to a tape platform requires:

- A tape library to identify the cartridge on which the data is stored.
- Reading several kilometers of tape to retrieve it.

In addition, Scaleway Glacier enables parallel writing to multiple disks simultaneously, providing very high read and write speeds. 
Redundancy is achieved by advanced parity mechanisms (6+3) on a large number of media, whereas tape technology does not allow this and is limited to CRC.
Finally, there is no risk of mechanical part failure (ex: robot) or wear and tear (tape drive).

## Can I change the storage class of an entire bucket from Standard to Glacier?

Yes, a best practice is to create a transition lifecycle rule with an empty prefix.
In this case, all files contained within the selected bucket will have their storage class altered automatically on the dates stipulated by you.
However, due to S3 Protocol restrictions, a lifecycle rule cannot be created to modify the storage class from glacier to standard.
