Scaleway [Kubernetes Kapsule and Kosmos](/containers/kubernetes/concepts/#kubernetes) provide a managed environment to create, configure and run a cluster of preconfigured machines for containerized applications. This allows you to create Kubernetes clusters without the complexity of managing the infrastructure. You can create a Kapsule cluster to your required specifications, edit it after creation and delete it all when you no longer need it. You might also want to check out our how-to on [deploying an image on your cluster](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/deploy-image-from-container-registry).

## How to create a Kubernetes cluster

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the side menu. The Kubernetes Kapsule dashboard displays.
2. Click **Create a cluster**. The first page of the cluster creation wizard displays.
3. This page concerns the configuration of your cluster. Enter the following information:
    * The **cluster type**. It can either be a: 
      * **Kubernetes Kapsule** cluster. It allows you to create clusters using exclusively Scaleway Instances, from the smallest development Instance to our GPU offers, including features such as node auto-healing and pools auto-scaling. 
      * **Kubernetes Kosmos** cluster. Kubernetes Kosmos is the first managed Kubernetes engine that allows you to attach an Instance or dedicated server from any Cloud provider to a Scaleway Kubernetes control plane.
    * The geographical **region** of the cluster.
    * The Kubernetes **version** for the cluster.
    * The **name** for the cluster and optionally a description, tags, which can help you to organize your cluster. 
4. * If you are creating a **Kubernetes Kapsule** cluster, click **Next**. The second page of the cluster creation wizard displays.
   * If you are creating a **Kubernetes Kosmos** cluster, click **Create a cluster** to create cluster without any pools. You can add them to the cluster later. Otherwise, click **Add and configure a Pool** to configure a node pool for your cluster.
5.  This page concerns the settings for your pool if you create a **Kubernetes Kapsule** cluster or if you want to use Scaleway nodes for your cluster with **Kubernetes Kosmos**. Enter the following information:
    * The **availability zone** in which all your pool's nodes will be created
    * The **node type** you require
    * The configuration for your **node options**, including the number of nodes and whether to enable autoscale. You can also choose whether to enable auto-heal and whether to link the cluster to a placement group. Alternatively, you can leave these options at default values.
6. Click **Create a cluster**.

## How to add a Scaleway pool to a Kubernetes Cluster

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the side menu. The Kubernetes dashboard displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the cluster you want to edit. Click **Add a pool** in the menu. The pool configuration wizard displays. 
3. This page concerns the configuration of your cluster. Enter the following information:
    - The **pool type** for the pool: Scaleway 
    - The geographical **region** of the pool.
    - The **node type** for the pool. 
    - If required configure the **node options** like autoscaling, autohealing, or link the pool to an existing placement group.
    - The **name** for the pool. Optionally you can assign tags to it.
4. Click **Add Pool**.

## How to add a Muti-Cloud pool to a Kubernetes Cluster

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the side menu. The Kubernetes dashboard displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the pool you want to edit. Click **Add a pool** in the menu. The pool configuration wizard displays. 
3. Click **Add Pool**. 

### How to add external nodes to a Multi-Cloud pool

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the side menu. The Kubernetes dashboard displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the cluster you want to edit. Click **More info** in the menu. The cluster dashboard displays. Click the **Pools** tab. 
3. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the pool you want to edit. Click **More info** in the menu. Click **Add a node** in the menu. The node information page displays. 
4. This page provides information on how to add your external node to the pool. Connect to your node and run the following command to add the node: 
    ```sh 
    $> wget https://scwcontainermulticloud.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/multicloud-init.sh && chmod +x multicloud-init.sh
    $> ./multicloud-init.sh -p c58bcee3-52db-4501-a96e-41dddbb6e5f4 -r fr-par -t SCW_SECRET_KEY
    ```

    Make sure you have: 
    * A server running with Ubuntu 20.04, having a public IP assigned to it
    * A Scaleway [secret key](/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key)

## How to edit a Kubernetes cluster

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the side menu. The Kubernetes dashboard displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the cluster you want to edit.
3. Choose the option you require:
    * **More info**: See detailed information about the Cluster
    * **Add a pool**: Add additional computing resources to the Cluster
    * **Get kubeconfig**: Download the `.kubeconfig` file of the Cluster
    * **Delete**: Delete the Cluster

## How to delete a Kubernetes cluster

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the side menu. The Kubernetes dashboard displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> to display the options menu, then click **Delete**. A cluster deletion pop-up displays. 
3. Type **DELETE** to confirm the deletion of your cluster. Tick the checkbox to automatically delete all volumes (including those with volume type “retain”) and Load Balancers whose names start with cluster ID. Valitate your choice by clicking **Delete this cluster**. 
    <Message type="important">
      Deleting your cluster will permanently destroy your cluster and all its associated pools and Instances. External compute resources cannot be destroyed automatically and will remain active until destroyed at the concerned cloud service provider (CSP).
