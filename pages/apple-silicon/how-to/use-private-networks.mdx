Private Networks allow your Mac mini to communicate in an isolated and secure network with other Scaleway resources, without needing to be connected to the public internet. This is an optional-billed feature for Mac mini.

Each Mac mini can be connected to one or several Private Networks, letting you build your own network topologies. Private Networksâ€™ built-in DHCP server manages the allocation of private IP addresses for Mac mini servers (and other resources) when they are attached to the network.

## How to enable the Private Networks feature

Before you can attach your Mac mini to a Private Network, you must enable the feature. This can be done during [Mac mini creation](/bare-metal/apple-silicon/how-to/create-mac-mini/) or afterwards. These instructions show how to enable the feature after creation of the Mac mini.

1. Click **Apple silicon** in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu. The Apple silicon splash page displays.
2. Click the Mac mini you want to enable Private Networks on. The Mac mini's **Overview** page displays.
3. In the **Private Networks feature** panel, use the <Icon name="toggle" /> toggle button to enable the feature.
    A pop-up displays, asking you to confirm that you want to enable Private Networks, and showing the estimated cost.
4. Click **Enable Private Networks**.

Private Networks are enabled, and you are returned to your Mac mini's **Overview** page.
