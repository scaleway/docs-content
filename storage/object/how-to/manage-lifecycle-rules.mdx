With the Scaleway Console, you can change objects to a different storage class [manually](/storage/object/how-to/edit-storage-class/) or automatically with lifecycle rules. These rules also allow users to set expiration dates for objects and object versions.

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)  
  - You have [created an Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)

</Message>

## How to create a lifecycle rule
1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the name of your bucket. The list of your objects displays
3. Click **Lifecycle Rules**. 
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-lifecycle-rule.webp" alt="" />

4. Click **+ Create Lifecycle Rule** to add a rule.
5. Enter a name for the rule.
6. Filter the objects you want the rule to be applied to by one or both of the following criteria:
    - **Prefix**: based on the object name. The defined rule will be applied to all objects with the same name prefix.
    - **Tags**: comprised of a **key** and an associated **value**. These tags should be defined prior to the rule creation, for either a bucket or an object. You can add one or more tags to your filter.

## How to configure transition rules

If you wish to change the [storage class](/concepts/#storage-class) of two or more objects at a time, you can set up a transition rule that will automate the process.

1. Click <Icon name="toggle" /> **Change object class** to transfer the current version of the objects to a different storage class. 

2. Select the class. 

3. Click **-** or **+**, or type in the exact amount of days after the rule's creation you want the current version to be transferred to another class. 

4. Click **Next Step** to proceed.

5. Check that all settings are correct and click **Create Lifecycle Rule** to confirm.

A list of the lifecycle rules displays. 


## How to configure expiration rules

If you wish to delete an object after a set number of days, you can set up an expiration rule that will automate the process. 

1. Click <Icon name="toggle" /> **Delete after expiration** to define when the current version of your objects will be deleted. 

2. Click **-** or **+**, or type in the exact amount of days after the rule's creation you want the current version to be deleted.

3. Click **Next Step** to proceed.

4. Check that all settings are correct and click **Create Lifecycle Rule** to confirm.

A list of the lifecycle rules displays. 


## How to disable a lifecycle rule

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. A list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the name of your bucket.
3. Click the **Lifecycle Rules** tab. A list of your rules displays.
4. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to name of the rule.

Once disabled, the lifecycle rule remains listed and can be enabled again. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Activate** to do so. 

If you wish to permanently delete a rule, click  <Icon name="more" /> > **Delete**.
