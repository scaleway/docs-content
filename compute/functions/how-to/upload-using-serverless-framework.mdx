The Scaleway functions plugin for [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/) allows users to deploy their functions and containers to Scaleway Functions with a simple serverless deploy.

Serverless Framework handles everything from creating namespaces to function/code deployment by calling APIs endpoint under the hood.
<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)  
  - You have [configured your API keys](/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key/) for your **Project**
  - You know your **Project ID**
  - You have installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - You have installed the [Serverless CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless) on your computer (`npm install serverless -g`)

</Message>

## Create a project folder

Serverless Framework enables you to create a project using a specific template.

1. Start by creating and changing into `~/my-srvless-projects`:

```bash
mkdir ~/my-srvless-projects
cd ~/my-srvless-projects
```

2. Create a simple Python 3 template by running: 

```bash
serverless create --template-url https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-scaleway-functions/tree/master/examples/python3 --path myService
```
You can find other Scaleway templates on [our Github](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-scaleway-functions/tree/master/examples).

### How to edit the serverless.yml file

<Message type="important">

  Do not edit the `provider.name` and `plugins` parameters, as these allow you to use the Scaleway provider.

</Message>

The `serverless.yml` file contains the configuration of a namespace containing one or more containers with the same runtime. In the following example, we use one container and a `python3` runtime. 

The different parameters are:
- `service`: your namespace name
- `provider.runtime`: the runtime of your functions (check the supported runtimes above)
- `provider.env`: the environment variables attached to your namespace are injected into all your namespace containers
- `scwToken`: the Scaleway **token** you got in prerequisites
- `scwProject`: the Scaleway **Project ID** 
- `package.patterns`: usually, this parameter does not need to be configured. It allows you to include or exclude directories from the deployment
- `functions`: Configuration of your functions. It is a `yml` dictionary, with the key being the containers' name
  - `handler` (Required): file or function which will be executed. 
  - `env` (Optional): environment variables specifics for the current function
  - `minScale` (Optional): how many function instances we keep running (default: 0)
  - `maxScale` (Optional): maximum number of instances this function can scale to (default: 20)
  - `memoryLimit`: RAM allocated to the function instances. 
  - `runtime`: (Optional) runtime of the function. Can be used when you need to deploy multiple functions with different runtimes in your Serverless Project. If absent, `provider.runtime` will be used.
  - `events` (Optional): List of events that trigger your functions (e.g, trigger a function based on a schedule with `CRONJobs`). 

## How to configure your Functions Handler

Based on the chosen runtime, the `handler` variable in the function might vary.

<Message type="note">

  For more detail on how to package your dependencies please refer to [How to package your function and upload it as a Zip](/compute/functions/how-to/package-function-in-zip/).

</Message>

### Node

1. Path to your handler file (from `serverless.yml`), omit `./`, `../`, and add the exported function to use as a handler:

```
# ls
- src
  - handlers
    - firstHandler.js  => module.exports.myFirstHandler = ...
    - secondHandler.js => module.exports.mySecondHandler = ...
- serverless.yml
```

2. In the `serverless.yml` file, launch:
```yml
provider:
  # ...
  runtime: node8 # or node10 or node14
functions:
  first:
    handler: src/handlers/firstHandler.myFirstHandler
  second:
    handler: src/handlers/secondHandler.mySecondHandler
```

3. Include the `node_modules` folder in your package list to add dependencies to your function.

```yml
package:
  patterns:
    - '!.gitignore'
    - '!.git/**'
    - './node_modules/**'
```


### Python

1. Path to the handler file `src/testing/handler.py`:
```
- src
  - handlers
    - firstHandler.py  => def my_first_handler
    - secondHandler.py => def my_second_handler
- serverless.yml
```

2. Launch in `serverless.yml`:
```yml
provider:
  # ...
  runtime: python3 # or python for python 2.7
functions:
  first:
    handler: src/handlers/firstHandler.my_first_handler
  second:
    handler: src/handlers/secondHandler.my_second_handler
```

### Golang
	
If you have the following structure, the path to your handler's **package** should resemble the following:

```
- src
  - testing
    - handler.go -> package main in src/testing subdirectory
  - second
    - handler.go -> package main in src/second subdirectory
- serverless.yml
- handler.go -> package main at the root of project
```

Your serverless.yml `functions` should be similar to:

```yml
provider:
  # ...
  runtime: golang
functions:
  main:
    handler: "."
  testing:
    handler: src/testing
  second:
    handler: src/second
```

## How to configure your events

With `events`, you may link your containers to specific triggers. For the moment, the feature is limited to `CRON Schedule (time-based)`.

<Message type="note">

We do not include HTTP triggers in our event types, as an HTTP endpoint is created for every function. Triggers are just another way to trigger your functions, but you will always be able to execute your code via HTTP.

</Message>

Below is a list of supported triggers for Scaleway Serverless, and the configuration parameters required to deploy them:

- **schedule**: Triggers your container based on CRON schedules
  - `rate`: the CRON Schedule (UNIX Format) on which your functions will be executed
  - `input`: key-value mapping to define arguments that will be passed to your function's event object during execution.

To link a Trigger to your function, you can define an `events` key in your function:

```yml
functions:
  handler: myHandler.handle
  events:
    # "events" is a list of triggers, the first key being the type of trigger.
    - schedule:
        # CRON Job Schedule (UNIX Format)
        rate: '1 * * * *'
        # Input variable are passed in your function's event during execution
        input:
          key: value
          key2: value2
```

<Message type="tip">

  You can find other examples of trigger configurations [here](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-scaleway-functions/tree/master/examples/nodejs10-schedule)

</Message>

## Accessingccess Logs

The `serverless logs` command allows you to watch the logs of a specific function.
Add the `--function` option and the function's name to the `serverless logs` command to fetch the logs of a specific container.


```bash
serverless logs --function <function_name>`
```

## Deleting a project

Run the following command to remove a project:

```bash
serverless remove
```

This removes all your containers, as well as your Scaleway Functions' namespace.

<Message type="note">
 
  Your Scaleway Functions Registry namespace is not automatically removed. You must delete it manually either via the Scaleway console, or Scaleway's Functions Registry API.
