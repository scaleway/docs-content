An IAM [policy](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/policy) is used to define the permissions of users, groups and applications in a given [Organization](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#organization). A policy is composed of a **principal** (the user, group or application to which it applies) and one or more **IAM rules** (which describe the permission sets the principal should have, and the scope of those permission sets).

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You are the Owner of your Organization, or an IAM user in an Organization where you have the relevant [permission set(s)](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/permission-sets). 
</Message>

1. Click **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** from the top-right of your [**Organization Dashboard**](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) in the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) displays.

2. Click the **Policies** tab. A list of the Organization's existing policies displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-policies.webp" alt="" />
3. Click the <Icon name="plus" /> button to create a new IAM policy. The policy creation wizard displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-policy-p1.webp" alt="" />
4. Complete the steps of the first page of the creation wizard:
    - Enter a **name** for the policy.
    - Enter a **description** (optional).
    - Select a **principal**, who will be the target of your policy. The [principal](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#principal) should be the user, application or group who you want to give certain permissions to via this policy.
    <Message type="important">
      You can choose to create a policy without a principal for now, and attach the principal later. Be aware that the policy will have no effect until a principal is attached. A policy can only be attached to one principal at a time.
    </Message>
5. Click **Add rules** to progress to the next part of the policy creation wizard.

    <Message type="tip">
      Rules define the actions that the attached principal will be able to carry out within the Organization. When creating a rule, you first set the **scope** of the rule, and then select the **permission sets** to apply within the scope. See our dedicated documentation for more help with [policies, rules, scopes and permission sets](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/policy/).
    </Message>
6. Select a **scope** for the rule:
    - To give the principal permissions to view, create, edit and/or delete [resources](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#resource), select the **Access to resources** scope. Then, select the [Project](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#project) in which you want the permissions to apply. You can select from **all current and future Projects**, **all current Projects** or select specific Projects.
    - To give the principal permissions to [Organization](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#organization)-level features such as IAM, billing, support & abuse tickets and project management, select the **Access to Organization features** scope. 
7. Click **Validate** to continue.
8. Choose the **permission sets** for the rule by selecting the required boxes. You can select as many permission sets as you like. The principal will have the rights defined in these permission sets within the scope you set in step 6. See our dedicated documentation for [more help with permission sets](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/permission-sets).
9. Click **Validate**. The rule, with its scope and permission sets, is added to the list of the policy's rules.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-policy-rule.webp" alt="" />
10. Click **Add new rule** and repeat steps 6-8 as many times as required to add multiple rules to your policy.
    <Message type="tip">
      You can delete <Icon name="delete" /> or edit <Icon name="edit" /> an existing rule by clicking the relevant button in the top right corner of the rule's summary.
    </Message>
11. Click **Create policy** to finish.

    You are returned to the **Policies** tab, where the newly-created policy now appears in the list.
