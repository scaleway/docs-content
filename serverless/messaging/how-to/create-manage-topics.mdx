This page shows how to create and manage SNS [topics](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#topic) with Scaleway Messaging and Queuing.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Activated SNS](/serverless/messaging/how-to/get-started/#how-to-activate-sqs-or-sns) for the [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) in which you want to create a topic

## How to create a topic

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of Messaging and Queuing protocols displays.

2. Use the drop-down menu to select the [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) in which you want to create a topic.

3. Click **SNS**, then navigate to the **Topics** tab and click **Create topic**. The topic creation wizard displays.

4. Enter a **name** for your topic. The name must contain no more than 80 characters, and consist only of alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. Alternatively, you can go with the auto-generated name suggested for you.

5. Choose a **topic type**. Currently, only the **Standard** topic type is available, ensuring at-least-once delivery. See the [topic types](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#topic-types) documentation for more information.

6. Click **Create topic** to finish.

You are returned to the **Topics** tab, where your newly-created topic now displays. The topic's URL is also displayed here, for use in your API/CLI operations.

<Message type="tip">
Remember that you need to [create credentials](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-credentials/) in order to access your SNS service and its topics from an API or CLI. Sending messages to topics requires that credentials have the `can_publish` permission, while receiving messages from topics requires the `can_receive` permission. You can create separate credentials if you need to isolate these two roles in your application.
</Message>

## How to delete a topic

When you no longer want a topic, you can delete it. This action is irreversible and deletes the topic along with all its associated subscriptions.

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of Messaging and Queuing protocols displays.

2. Use the drop-down menu to select the [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) containing the topic you want to delete.

3. Click **SNS**, then navigate to the **Topics** tab, where the list of your topics in the pre-selected region displays.

4. Click the topic you wish to delete. The topic's **Settings** page displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-topic-settings.webp" alt="" />

5. Either:
    - Click the topic you wish to delete. The topic's **Settings** page displays. Click the **Delete topic** button in the bottom right corner.
    - Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the topic you wish to delete, then select **Delete** from the menu that displays.

    A pop-up asks you to confirm that you understand this action will delete the topic and all of its associated subscriptions.

6. Type **DELETE** and click **Delete topic**.
