- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## Storage resources overview
You can manage the storage resources attached to your Instances directly from the Scaleway console. These include:

- **[Volumes](#managing-volumes)**: Storage spaces used by your Instances. Multiple volumes can be attached to an Instance.
- **[Snapshots](#managing-snapshots)**: Backups capturing the state of a volume at a specific time, including OS, configuration, and stored files.
- **[Images](#managing-images)**: Full backups of Instances, useful for restoring data or deploying multiple Instances with a predefined configuration.

## Managing volumes
Volumes are the primary storage solution for your Instances. Scaleway Instances support either **Local Storage** or **Block Storage**, depending on the Instance type.

<Message type="tip">
  If a volume is missing, check the [Block Storage](https://console.scaleway.com/block-storage/volumes) or [Local Storage](https://console.scaleway.com/local-storage/volumes) sections in the Scaleway console.

5. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to a volume for options:
    - View volume details
    - [Increase volume size](/block-storage/how-to/increase-block-volume/)
    - [Detach volume](/block-storage/how-to/detach-a-volume/)
    - [Create a snapshot](/block-storage/how-to/create-a-snapshot/)
