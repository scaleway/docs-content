This document shows you have to change your password using the [rescue system](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/use-rescue-mode/). If we then try to use the usual `passwd` command to change the password, you will only change the password of the rescue system. After a reboot your modifications will be reset. We therefore show you how to access your real files in order to change your password.

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net)
  - You have [created](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/order-a-server) and [installed](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/install-a-server) a dedicated server

</Message>

1. From the console, [launch rescue mode](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/use-rescue-mode/).

2. Mount your partitions:

  ```
  sudo mountall.sh
  ```

  <Message tpye="note">

  The mounted partitions are available in the directory `/mnt`. This means, you find the partition `/dev/sda1` mounted in `/mnt/sda1`.

  </Message>

3. Chroot yourself into the root partition:

  ```
  sudo chroot /mnt/sda2
  ```

  <Message type="note">

    - If you [installed your server](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/install-a-server) with the default partition layout, the root partition will be mounted on sda2.
    - If you configured custom partitioning, your root partition may be mounted elsewhere. 

  </Message>

4. Use the following command to change the password:
  ```
  passwd
  ```
  You will be prompted two times to set the new password. While you are writing, nothing will appear on screen. This is a normal security measure.

  <Message type="tip">

  If you want to reset the password of a user other than root, use the following command, replacing **USERNAME** with the relevant username.
  `passwd USERNAME`

  </Message>

5. Type `exit` when you have finished your modifications.

6. Type the following command to finish:
  ```
  sudo umountall.sh && sudo reboot
  ```

7. From the console, click **Boot in normal mode** to reboot the server.

Your root password is now changed.
