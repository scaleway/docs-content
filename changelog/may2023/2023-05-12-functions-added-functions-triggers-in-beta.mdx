Functions can now be triggered from Message Queues hosted in Messaging and Queuing SQS namespace.
Simply add a [SQS Trigger](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/serverless/functions/how-to/add-trigger-to-a-function/) from the console and when a new message will be sent to the queue, it will trigger your function.
