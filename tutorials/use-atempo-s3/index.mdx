## Miria - Overview

[Miria](https://www.atempo.com/products/miria-backup-and-migration-for-large-file-storages/) is a proprietary software developed by [Atempo](https://www.atempo.com/) for high-performance data management.

Miria is able to backup, archive, synchronize, migrate and move unstructured data (files and folders) between large heterogeneous storage. It provides a single and scalable plaftorm to manage data movements for a broad range of storage platforms.

Moreover, Miria is designed to efficiently handle any typology of unstructured data ranging from billions of small files to huge 10K raw video files.

Depending on the project, Miria Server and Data Movers can be installed on an on-premise infrastructure, on a **Scaleway Elements Virtual Instance**, on **Scaleway Bare Metal Cloud Servers** or a hybrid typology.

For the data management itself, Miria will push data into Scaleway Object Storage using its native S3 connector.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have an [Object Storage](/storage/object/concepts/#bucket) bucket

</Message>

## Configuring your bucket

1. Log in to your Scaleway account and click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section in the left menu.

2. Create a new bucket by clicking on the green **+ Create a bucket** button.

  <Message type="important">

    We strongly recommend using an empty bucket with Miria as all data not pushed through Miria will remain in the bucket, but not be manageable.

  </Message>

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-a-bucket.png" alt="" />

3. Once created, open bucket settings and enable bucket versioning.

## Configuring Miria

You can proceed to creating a new backup task in the Miria **Tasks** menu.

1. Open the Miria console, then select **Storage Managers** on the left pane.

2. Create a new Storage Manager and select **Generic S3 Protocol** in the **Type** drop down menu:
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-miria-storage-manager.png" alt="" />

3. Under **Properties**, configure the **Default Network Address** to:

    - `s3.fr-par.scw.cloud:s` for Paris region
    - `s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud:s` for Amsterdam region
    - `s3.pl-waw.scw.cloud:s` for Warsaw region

  <Message type="note">

  The `:s` at the end of network address should always be included in order to ensure secured HTTPS protocol is used.
  Other criteria can remain as the default.

  </Message>

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-configure-default-network-properties.png" alt="" />
4. Once the Storage Manager is created, right-click it to select a new **Storage
Manager Container**:
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-new-storage-manager-container.png" alt="" />

5. Enter a name for the new Storage Manager Container. It is suggested that you use the same name as your bucket to facilitate organization.

6. Set your access key and secret key. They can be found on your account information page in the Scaleway Console, under **Credentials**.

7. Provide the **Bucket Name** and tick the boxes to **Manage Bucket Versioning** and **Metadata**.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-bucket-atempo-miria.png" alt="" />

  The new Storage Manager Container is now ready to be used to store various types
  of data such as backups, archives or synchronized files from primary storage.

<Message type="tip">

Additionally, you can:

- Enable Data compression to optimize the size of data stored in the Object Storage
- Configure the structure of data inside the bucket in **Prefix** section

</Message>

## Backing up your data

See an example of a backup task configuration below:

<Lightbox src="scaleway-example-of-task-configuration.png" alt="" />

1. Start the task from the Miria control panel. Depending on the amount of data you transfer and the available bandwidth of your local Internet connection, the backup may take a while.

  You can check the progression of the transfer in the status tab:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-check-progression.png" alt="" />

Files and folders are being pushed to Scaleway Object Storage. By default [Versioning](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-operations/#put-bucket-versioning) is enabled, meaning multiple versions of an Object are stored to be able to restore intermediate versions of files in case of need.

  />

2. By clicking on the file name, a list of all saved versions displays and each of them can be restored in case of need:

  You are now ready to push your Petabytes to **Scaleway Object Storage** with the
  help of **Atempo Miria**. For more information about Miria and Atempo backup solutions,
