Scaleway [Elastic Metal servers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/elastic-metal/) allow you to order dedicated servers on-demand, like cloud Instances. Elastic Metal servers can be used for large workloads, big data and applications that require increased security and dedicated resources.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)

- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
