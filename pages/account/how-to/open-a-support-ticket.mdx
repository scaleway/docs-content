- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)

## Opening a support ticket

1. Click **Help** at the right of the top menu. The [Help center](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets) displays.
2. Click **Open a support ticket** under **Contact us**.
3. Fill in the required information:

- **Selected product**: choose the product related to your issue from the available options, such as Instances, GPU, or Elastic Metal.

- **Related resource**: specify the exact resource affected by the issue, such as a specific Instance or volume.

- **Severity**: select the severity level based on the impact of the issue (see table below). 


| **Severity** | **Description**                                                           | **Examples**                                           |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Low**      | Non-urgent issues with minimal impact on your operations.                 | General questions about product configuration.         |
| **Medium**   | Issues that affect your operations but have workarounds available.        | Instance is slower than expected but still accessible. |
| **High**     | Critical issues that block your operations, with no available workaround. | API calls consistently fail with errors.               |


## Writing an effective subject and description

Providing a clear subject and description will help us resolve your issue faster.

- **Subject**: write a short and clear title that summarizes the issue (e.g., "Instance not starting after configuration update", "API call returns 500 error for all requests").

- **Description**: write a detailed description to help us resolve the issue faster. Here are a few tips on how to write a ticket description:

### Clearly describe the issue
- **Context:** explain when and where the problem occurs.
Example: “The issue occurs when attempting to start an Instance after applying a configuration update in the Scaleway console.”

- **Expected behavior:** explain what you expected to happen.
Example: “The instance should start within 2 minutes without errors.”

- **Actual behavior:** describe what is happening instead.
Example: “The Instance remains in "Starting" status for over 10 minutes and then switches to "Error". 

### Include relevant technical details

- **Environment details:** mention your operating system, tools, or SDKs (e.g., “Ubuntu 20.04, Scaleway API v2, Python SDK.”)

- **Logs or error messages:** include any logs, request/response payloads, or error codes (e.g., “API call GET /instances returns 500 Internal Server Error.”)

### Add supporting files

Attach screenshots (png, jpg), or files (pdf). 
Examples: 
- Screenshot of the Scaleway console
- Screenshot of the network tab of your browser’s Developer Tools (right-click anywhere on the page and select **Inspect**. Go to the **Network tab** in the Developer Tools panel.)
- Logs
