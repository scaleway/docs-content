  Due to license constraints, the minimum lease for Apple silicon is 24 hours. As a result, the earliest you can delete a Mac mini is 24 hours after the start of its lease.

1. Click **Apple silicon** in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu. The Apple silicon splash page displays.
    <Message type="note">
      Should your account already contain Mac minis, a list of these will be displayed rather than the Apple silicon splash page.
      Alongside, you will see the (<Icon name="plus" />) icon, which you can click on to create a new Mac mini, if desired.

2. Click **Create Mac mini**. The Mac mini creation wizard displays.

    - Enter a **Name** for your Mac mini, or leave the randomly-generated name in place.
    - Verify the **Estimated cost** for your Mac mini based on your chosen specifications.
