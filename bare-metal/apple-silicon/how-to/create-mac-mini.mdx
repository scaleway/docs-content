This page shows how to create your first [Mac mini](/bare-metal/apple-silicon/concepts/#mac-mini) with the Scaleway console.

  Due to license constraints, the minimum lease for Apple silicon is 24 hours. As a result, a Mac mini can only be deleted after 24 hours have passed from when you initiated the lease.

      If you have existing Mac minis in your account, you will see a list of
      these instead of the creation page, alone with the <Icon name="plus" />
      button for creating a new Mac mini.
