Some users experienced an issue on the console and API where logs where not appearing. This bug is now fixed.

We also recommend to use Serverless Functions dashboards in [Scaleway Cokpit](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/observability/cockpit/quickstart/) to monitor all your metrics and logs and access advanced features (ordering, filtering ...)
