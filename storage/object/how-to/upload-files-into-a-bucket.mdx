5. Select the Storage Class of your object. Scaleway Object Storage allows you to associate storage classes with each of your objects. You can choose the storage class depending on your use case:
- [STANDARD](/storage/object/concepts#storage-class): The Standard class for any upload; suitable for on-demand content
  like streaming or CDN.
- [GLACIER](/storage/object/concepts#storage-class): Archived storage; prices are lower, but it needs to be restored
  first to be accessed.
  <Message type="note">

  - Pricing depends on the storage class you have selected. 
  - It is possible to change storage classes at any time from the Object Storage bucket dashboard. Learn more about the specificities of **GLACIER** class on [C14 Cold Storage](https://www.scaleway.com/en/c14-cold-storage/).
