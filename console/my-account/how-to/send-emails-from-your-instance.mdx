By default, remote email ports (25, 465, 587) are blocked, and cannot be reached from our infrastructure to avoid spam. You will need to open the mail ports to send emails. You can enable them from the security group configuration.

    If you have not created any security groups, your Instance has been assigned to the default security group, so this will be the one you should modify.
