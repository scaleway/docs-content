## Intro

An overview of Serverless Containers, Kapsule (Kubernetes), and Virtual Instances to help you deploy containerized apps effectively.

-> one line per product with key differentiator

## Assessing your needs

Understand key factors like control, scalability, expertise, and application state to guide your choice.

## Serverless Containers: deploy Fast, scale automatically

Fully managed, pay-per-use containers ideal for stateless apps and rapid deployment with zero operational overhead. 

-> from image to running app in minutes

## Kapsule: managed Kubernetes for scalable workloads

A CNCF-certified, production-ready Kubernetes service for microservices, auto-scaling, and resilient applications. 

-> Robust scalable infra with high control

## Instances: full control over your environment

Run containers on flexible VMs with full root access, ideal for custom runtimes, licensing, or advanced networking needs.

-> Flexibility on container management solution (containerd / podman / compose / k3s & microk8s)

## How to choose: use case comparison

Compare solutions side-by-side and pick the best fit based on speed, control, cost, and technical requirements.

-> Different scenarios (quick vs big vs flex)

## Leveraging Scaleway Container Registry

-> all images in one place aloowing to easily deploy, scale, update, move, remove apps

## Storage

Instances: Local / Block / File 
K8s: PVs using Scaleway CSI driver
Serverless Containers: any storage backend set up at the app level
