Permissions sets and their scope make up [IAM rules](/iam/concepts/#rule), which define the access rights that a principal (user, group or application) should have. They consist of sets of one or multiple [permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission).

Permission set names contain descriptions that clearly explain their purpose. For example, a permission set that grants access to all actions you can perform on Instances is called: `InstancesFullAccess`.

Below is a list of the permission sets available at Scaleway.
