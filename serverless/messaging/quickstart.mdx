Scaleway Messaging and Queuing is a [message broker](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#messaging-and-queuing) tool that allows you to transfer messages between different microservices and platforms. This enables them to "talk" to each other effectively even if they are not otherwise compatible. Messaging and Queuing enables and simplifies microservices application development and allows you to build highly scalable, reliable, distributed applications.

To get started with Scaleway Messaging and Queuing, you need to create a namespace and generate its credentials. You can then use any supported SDK or CLI of your choice to start creating and managing queues, topics and messages. When you no longer need your namespace, you can delete it.

## How to create a namespace

A [namespace](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#namespace) sets a scope for your queues, topics and credentials. For each namespace, you can generate one or multiple sets of credentials, which allow the bearer to perform actions within that namespace, [dependent on their access rights](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#credentials). Actions could include creating topics or queues, publishing messages, reading messages etc. Namespaces therefore allow you to isolate queues and topics from each other, as credentials only give access to queues and topics within that namespace.

Two types of namespaces are available: [NATS](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#nats) and [SNS/SQS](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#sqssns). The type of namespace that you choose determines the messaging system used to distribute and queue your messages.

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The Messaging and Queuing namespace creation page displays.
2. Click **Create a namespace**. The namespace creation wizard displays.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 
    - Choose a **region**, which is the geographical region in which your namespace will be created.
    - Choose a namespace **type**. The namespace type determines the message system used to distribute and queue your messages. Currently, two types are available:
        - **NATS**: Choose this namespace type if you want to use the [NATS](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#nats) messaging system. When you later create credentials, they will be scoped at the namespace level and give full access to all streams related to the namespace.
        - **SQS/SNS**: Choose this namespace type if you want to use the [SQS](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#sqssns) and/or [SNS](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#sns) messaging systems. When you later create credentials, they will be scoped at the namespace level and you can select the required level of access (read/write/manage) for each set of credentials. 
    - Choose a **name** for your namespace, or use the randomly-generated name suggested.
4. Click **Create a namespace** to finish.

    Your namespace is created. You are taken to the list of all your namespaces, where your newly-created namespace now appears.

## How to generate credentials

Credentials give their bearer (e.g. services and platforms) access to your namespace. The process of creating credentials differs depending on the namespace type ([NATS](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#nats) or [SQS/SNS](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#sqssns)).

You can create multiple sets of credentials for each namespace.

### How to create credentials for a NATS namespace

Credentials for NATS namespaces are not granular: they necessarily give full read and write access to the namespace. The bearer of these credentials can publish and receive messages, as well as manage topics and streams.

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The list of your Messaging and Queuing namespaces displays.
2. Click the NATS namespace you wish to create credentials for. The namespace's **Overview** page displays.
3. In the **Credentials** panel, click **Generate credentials**. A pop-up displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-nats-credentials.webp" alt="" />
4. Enter a name for these credentials, and click **Generate credentials**.

    The credentials are created and a button displays prompting you to download them in a `.creds` file. 

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-nats-creds-generated.webp" alt="" />
    
    <Message type="important">
      This is your only chance to download these credentials.
    </Message>
5. Click **Download** and save the file, before closing the window.

    You are returned to your namespace's overview page. The name of your newly-generated credentials and their access level is displayed in the **Credentials** tab.

### How to create credentials for an SQS/SNS namespace

Credentials for SQS/SNS namespaces are granular: you can define the level of access that they should give.

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The list of your Messaging and Queuing namespaces displays.
2. Click the SQS/SNS namespace you wish to create credentials for. The namespace's **Overview** page displays.
3. In the **Credentials** panel, click **Generate credentials**. A pop-up displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-sqssns-credentials.webp" alt="" />
4. Enter a name for these credentials.
5. Select the required permissions for the credentials. You must choose at least one of **Write**, **Read** and **Manage**. You are free to select any combination of these permissions. 
6. Click **Generate credentials**.

    The credentials are created. The access key and secret key are displayed, and you are invited to copy them.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-sqssns-creds-generated.webp" alt="" />
    
    <Message type="important">
      This is your only chance to view and save the secret key. Make sure that you copy it and save it somewhere securely.
    </Message>
7. Copy and save the credentials, before closing the window.

    You are returned to your namespace's overview page. The name of your newly-generated credentials, along with the access key and access level are displayed in the **Credentials** tab.

## How to create and manage queues, topics, messages and more

All further actions related to publishing, processing and managing messages, subjects, queues and streams can be done via a supported CLI or SDK. See our documentation on [NATS CLI and SDKs](/serverless/messaging/reference-content/nats-overview#further-actions:-nats-cli-and-nats-sdk) and [SNS/SQS CLI and SDKs](/serverless/messaging/reference-content/snssqs-overview#further-actions) for more information.

## How to delete a namespace

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The list of your Messaging and Queuing namespaces displays.
2. Click the <Icon name="more" /> button next to the namespace you want to update. A menu displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-namespace-menu.webp" alt="" />
3. Select **Delete**. A popup displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-delete-namespace.webp" alt="" />

    <Message type="important">
      Deleting a namespace is irreversible. Any URLs, credentials and queued messages belonging to this namespace will also be deleted.
    </Message>
4. Type **DELETE** to confirm, and click **Delete namespace**.

    Your namespace is deleted. You are returned to your Messaging and Queuing overview page.
