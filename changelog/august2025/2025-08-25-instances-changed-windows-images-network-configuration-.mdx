Windows Server 2022 and Windows Server 2022 Core images now use DHCP for network configuration by default, consistent with all existing Instance OS images.

For running Instances, no network configuration changes are needed unless you modify the public IPv4 address.

If you change the public IPv4 address, the Instance will retain its existing static configuration and continue using the previous address. To enable DHCP for your Instance, follow our [dedicated documentation](/instances/reference-content/enabling-dhcp-network-configuration-windows-server-2022/) before updating the public IPv4 address.
