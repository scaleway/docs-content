When you [add your phone number](/account/how-to/create-an-account/#add-your-phone-number) to your Scaleway account, you receive a 6-digit code via SMS to enter in the Scaleway console and verify the number.

### Problem
You are not receiving an SMS with the code.

### Possible causes
- The phone number entered is incorrect.
- There is an ongoing issue with Scaleway's SMS provider.
- You phone number's country code is currently not authorized or there is a active rate limit for your country.

### Solution
- Check if the phone number you entered is correct.
- Check if there is an issue with Scaleway's SMS provider in the [Scaleway Status page](https://status.scaleway.com/).
