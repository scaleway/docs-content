Restricting IPs on Kubernetes Kapsule or Kosmos clusters enhances security by limiting access to only trusted sources. Since only IP addresses and networks specified by you can interact with your clusters, you reduce the risk of unauthorized access and potential attacks.

The default entry `0.0.0.0/0` enables any host to establish a connection.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing actions in the intended Organization
- [Created](/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster) a Kubernetes Kapsule or Kosmos cluster
<Message type="tip">
  Every cluster created after March 8th 2025 has this feature enabled by default. If you do not see the **Network** tab in your cluster's dashboard in the Scaleway console, then the feature is not enabled on your cluster. You can [open a support ticket](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create) to have it enabled manually.

## How to add an IP address

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com). The **Kubernetes dashboard** appears.
2. From the drop-down menu, select the geographical region you want to manage.
3. Select the cluster you wish to configure. The **Cluster information** page opens.
4. Click the **Network** tab to display your cluster's network information. Your access control list appears in the **Allowed IPs for control plane** section.
5. Click **Add allowed IP**. Enter the IP address or IP block in [CIDR notation](/ipam/concepts/#cidr-notation) (e.g., `198.51.100.135/32` for a single IP, `198.51.100.0/24` for an IP block), then click **Add IP(s)**.
   <Message type="note">
      To restore default settings and allow connections from all IPs, add `0.0.0.0/0` to the list.

    For **Kosmos** multi-cloud clusters, allow connections from all Scaleway IP subnets to ensure proper functionality. Access from these IPs cannot be restricted. Refer to our [peering information](https://www.scaleway.com/en/peering/) for details on all Scaleway IP prefixes.
