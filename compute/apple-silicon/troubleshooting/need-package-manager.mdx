[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager for macOS. It allows you to manage the packages installed on your Mac mini M1 and provides a way to install additional software on your machine.

1. Install Homebrew by running the following command:

  ```
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  ```

2. Update Homebrew by running the following command:

  ```
  brew update
  ```

3. Retrieve the list of all the outdated packages on your system:

  ```
  brew outdated
  ```

4. Upgrade these packages to the lastest version available in Homebrewâ€™s repositories:

  ```
  brew upgrade
  ```
