You can manage IAM users of an Organization if you are the Owner of that Organization, or if you have sufficient permissions (via policies) to do so. Management actions including adding and removing users to/from groups, attaching and detaching policies to/from users, viewing and deleting users' API keys and removing users from the Organization.

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)

When someone invites you to join their Organization, you receive an email to inform you.

1. Click **Accept Invitation** from your email invitation. The Scaleway console opens in a browser window. A pop-up displays introducing you to the Organization.

2. Click **Next** to proceed. The Organization dashboard displays. 

  You may be prompted to try creating a resource or viewing the [default Project](). You can choose to try these actions out, or simply close the window.

  <Message type="note">

  The Organization name is identical to the account Owner. 
  If the account was created without the Owner's name, 
  it will be the prefix of the email used to create the account. 
  For example, if the email used is `myemail@example.com`, 
  the Organization name will be `myemail`. In this case, 
  the Organization name can be set to the account owner's name, but only once.

  </Message>

  A message displays asking you to **Check your email**.

4. Check your email and click **Verify**.

5. Click **I Agree to the Terms of Service and Scaleway's Data Protection Agreement** to confirm.

The Scaleway console opens in the browser.
