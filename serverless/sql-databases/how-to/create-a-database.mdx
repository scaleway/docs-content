This page shows you how to create a Serverless SQL Database using the Scaleway console.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)

## How to create a database

1. Click **SQL Databases** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The Serverless SQL Databases page displays.

2. Click **+ Create database**. The database creation wizard displays.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Choose a **region**, which is the geographical location in which your database will be created.
    - Select a **default engine version** from the drop-down menu.
    - Configure your **database autoscaling**. Your database will scale within the defined range to match the incoming load.

      </Message>
    - Enter a **name** for your database, or keep the randomly-generated name. The name must only contain alphanumeric characters and dashes.
    - Verify the **estimated cost**.
4. Click **Create database** to finish. The setting up of your database will take a few seconds. Check the **Overview** tab to see its status.
