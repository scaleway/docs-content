## Proxmox - Overview

Proxmox Virtual Environment - or Proxmox VE is a server virtualization platform, based on Debian Linux. It allows the deployment and management of [KVM-based](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page) virtual machines or [LXC](https://linuxcontainers.org/) containers. The tool provides a REST-API as well as a graphical web interface to manage the virtual machines. It is also licensed under the [GNU Affero General Public License, version 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html).

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have at least two [Elastic Metal servers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/)
  - You have created a [Private Network](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/use-private-networks/) and [attached](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/use-private-networks/#how-to-attach-and-detach-elastic-metal-servers-to-a-private-network) your Elastic Metal servers to it

## Installing Proxmox

<Message type="note">
  Repeat these steps for each Elastic Metal Server you want to add to your cluster.
</Message>

1. Select your Elastic Metal server by clicking on **Elastic Metal** in the **Compute** section of the side menu of the Scaleway console.
2. Choose the server you want to install from the list and click its name to see the server dashboard.
3. Click **Install** and select **Proxmox VE 7** from the list of available images.

4. Enter your credentials. The service username is `root`. The service password must have eight characters minimum.
5. Enter a name and optional tags for your server.
6. Toggle the switch to enable the **Private Networks** feature for the server.
7. Click **Install this Elastic Metal server** to launch the installation.
    <Message type="note">
      The installation of your Elastic Metal server may take up to one hour. 
    </Message>

## Accessing Proxmox

Once the server has rebooted, the Proxmox web interface is available.

1. Open a web browser and go to `https://your_elastic_metal_server_ip:8006/`. The Proxmox login screen displays. 
2. Enter your credentials and click **Login**.

    Enter the credentials to log in:

      - **User name**: `root`
      - **Password**: The password set during the installation of Proxmox
      - **Realm**: `Linux PAM standard authentication`
      - **Language**: The display language of the Proxmox interface (i.e. `English`)

    The Proxmox dashboard displays.

## Configuring the Private Network
Instead of [configuring the Private Network interface directly from your server's command line](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/use-private-networks/#how-to-configure-the-network-interface-on-your-elastic-metal-server-for-private-networks), we must configure it using the Proxmox interface.
1. Click the Proxmox host in the datacenter menu on the left. The server's dashboard displays.
2. Click **Network** in the **System** section of the menu. The network dashboard displays. 
3. Click **Create** > **Linux VLAN**. 
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox-network-dashboard.webp" alt="" />
4. Enter the VLAN details for your Private Network: 
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox-vlan-details.webp" alt="" />

    * **Name**: The name of your primary network interface followed by a dot and the VLAN ID of your Private Network (e.g. `eno1.1918` for the primary network interface `eno1` and the VLAN ID `1918`)
    * **IPv4/CIDR**: The IP address of the machine in your Private Network followed by its CIDR netmask (e.g. `192.168.1.101/24`)
    * **(Optional) Gateway (IPv4)**: The IP address of your [Public Gateway](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#public-gateway), if you want to use one.
    * **Autostart**: Tick this box to automatically bring up the interface during system startup.
5. Click **Create** to create the Private Network interface.
    <Message type="note">
      Repeat the steps above on each node (in our case, each Elastic Metal server) you want to add to your Private Network.

## Creating a cluster 

1. Click **Cluster** in the Datacenter view of the Promox interface of your first node. The cluster dashboard displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox-cluster-overview.webp" alt="" />
2. Click **Create Cluster**. 
3. Enter a name for the cluster and select your Private Network as the cluster network. Then click **Create**. 
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox-create-cluster.webp" alt="" />
4. Select the cluster in the list and click **Join Information**. The cluster join information displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox-cluster-list.webp" alt="" />
5. Click **Copy Information** to copy the cluster join information into the clipboard. 
6. Go to the Proxmox interface of your second node and click **Cluster** to enter the cluster configuration from the Datacenter view of the machine. 
7. Click **Join Cluster** and paste the cluster join information in the form. 
8. Enter your first node's `root` password and click **Join** to link the machine to the cluster. 
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox-join-cluster.webp" alt="" />

The second node appears now in the cluster in the Datacenter view of Proxmox. You can manage both machines using a single interface. The communication between members of the cluster is entirely in your Private Network, ensuring the highest level of security and the lowest latency.
