The [RPN SAN](/dedibox-network/rpn/concepts/#rpn-san) is an iSCSI target, it is possible to mount it in Windows Server 2012 or later to use it as a normal disk in the system.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- A [Dedibox dedicated server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox)
- An [RPN SAN](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/storage/)

1. Launch the **Server Manager** application of Windows and click **Tools** > **iSCSI Initiator**.

  <Message type="tip">
    The initiator is not activated by the default on the system start. If you start it for the first time, you are asked if you want to start it during the system start. Click **yes** to confirm.

3. Click the **Targets** tab and select the target you want to connect to. Click **Connection** to confirm. The target will then be connected to the server as an unformatted disk.

  <Message type="tip">
    For a 1 TB SAN, keep the default choice. If you have a larger SAN, select GPT, Windows can not handle partitions larger than 2 TB with anything except GPT.
  </Message>
7. Format the disk with a file system (NTFS). Click **Next** > **Finish** to confirm formatting the disk.

    Once finished formatting (in about 10 minutes using quick formatting), the hard disk drive should be accessible from the server manager as a regular disk:
