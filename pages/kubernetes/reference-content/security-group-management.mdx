Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule and Kosmos provide managed Kubernetes services that simplify the deployment and management of containerized applications. As part of the security configuration for these services, Scaleway allows users to manage security groups for Kapsule pools to control network traffic to and from cluster nodes. This document outlines the process for managing security groups when creating and configuring pools in Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule.
Security Group Management for Kapsule Pools
When creating a Kapsule pool, you can specify a security group ID to associate an existing security group with the pool. This allows for customized network traffic rules tailored to your specific requirements.

If no security group ID is provided during pool creation, Scaleway assigns a default preconfigured security group named **Kapsule default security group**. This default security group is shared across all Kapsule pools within the same availability zone.
