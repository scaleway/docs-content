## How to enable the alert manager

Enabling Scaleway's regionalized alert manager allows you configure preconfigured alerts for your Scaleway resources.

1. Click **Cockpit** in the **Monitoring** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Cockpit** overview page displays.
2. Click the **Alerts** tab.
3. Click the **Region** drop-down and select the desired region.
      <Message type="important">
        Make sure that you select the same region as the [data sources](/cockpit/concepts/#data-sources) you want to be alerted for.
      </Message>
4. Click **Enable alert manager** under the **Alert manager** section. A pop-up displays prompting you to configure alert notifications.
    <Message type="tip">
      Configuring alert notifications consists of two steps:
      - Enabling the alert manager, and
      - Adding contacts
      This allows the contacts to receive notifications whenever alerts you have configured are triggered.

5. Click **Enable alert manager** to confirm. The step for adding contacts displays.
6. Enter an email address, then click **+ Add email** and **Add contacts**. Your email address displays in the **Contacts** section, and by default, the **Resolved notifications** box is ticked. This means that you will receive notifications for resolved alerts.
7. Optionally, click **Skip for now** if you do not want to add contacts yet.
    <Message type="note">
     You are prompted to create contacts when enabling the alert manager for the first time, or when re-enabling it after disabling. However, you can also [add](/cockpit/how-to/add-contact-points/) or manage them independently from the alert manager configuration at any time.
