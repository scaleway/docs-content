This document contains information to help you successfully create a CNAME record for your customized [Edge Services](/storage/object/how-to/get-started-edge-services) domain, and troubleshoot any potential DNS problems.

## What is a CNAME record?

A **C**anonical **Name** (CNAME) record is a type of [DNS record](/network/domains-and-dns/concepts/#dns-record). Generally, DNS records hold information for translating a domain or subdomain to an IP address, mail server or other domain/subdomain. They are crucial in directing internet traffic to the correct servers. More specifically, CNAME records map one domain name (an alias) to another (the canonical name). 

A CNAME record may look like the following:

| Hostname / Alias           | Destination / Canonical Name  |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `videos.example.com`       | `otherdomain.com`             |

In this case, when a DNS server sees this record for `videos.example.com` it will know not to direct traffic to `blog.example.com`'s own IP address, but to that of `otherdomain.com`. It will find `othercomain.com`'s IP address via its [A record](/network/domains-and-dns/concepts/#resource-records).

When the client actually connects to `otherdomain.com`'s IP address, the web server can see that the requested URL was `videos.example.com`, and deliver the relevant content.

## When and why do I need to create a CNAME record for Edge Services?

When you enable Edge Services, initially your bucket content is served through the standard Edge Services endpoint, e.g. `bucket-name.edge.scw.cloud`. If you do not want to customize the standard Edge Services endpoint, you do not need to worry about CNAME records.

However, if you choose to [customize your Edge Services endpoint with your own subdomain](/storage/object/how-to/get-started-edge-services/#how-to-configure-a-custom-domain), you are prompted, as part of the process, to create a CNAME record to point your subdomain to the Edge Services endpoint for your bucket.

## How to create a CNAME record

Log into your domain provider, and locate the DNS settings for your domain. Create a new CNAME record pointing your subdomain to the Edge Services endpoint for your bucket. This endpoint will be displayed in the Scaleway console.

The interface used by different domain providers varies, but creating your CNAME record may look like one of the following examples:

| Record                                     | Destination                              |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `my-chosen-subdomain.beautiful-domain.com` | `bucket-name.edge.scw.cloud`             |

| Subdomain                                  | Target host                                    |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `my-chosen-subdomain`                      | `bucket-name.edge.scw.cloud`                   |

| Host record                                | Points to                                      |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `my-chosen-subdomain`                      | `bucket-name.edge.scw.cloud`                   |

| `my-chosen-subdomain`                      | Record Type     | Value                                          |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `@`                                        | `CNAME`         | is an alias of `bucket-name.edge.scw.cloud`    |


You may also see a `TTL`field, which stands for **T**ime **T**o **L**ive.  This tells the DNS resolver how long it can cache this record, before it must re-check the original source in case something has changed. TTL is measured in seconds, and the default value is usually 12 hours (43200 seconds) or 24 hours (86400 seconds). 

 ## Troubleshooting DNS errors

When setting up your customized subdomain with Edge Services, you have the option to carry out a verification check on the CNAME record. Edge Services will query the subdomain and check that it resolves correctly to the Edge Services endpoint. If there is a problem, you will see an error message.

An error message may also display at a later point from your Edge Services dashboard if a problem is detected at any point with your CNAME record or subdomain.

See the table below for help with troubleshooting these errors:

| Error message                             | Solution                                                            |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No CNAME record found                     | Make sure you have created a valid CNAME record where your subdomain points to the Edge Services endpoint.  |
| Incorrect CNAME                           | Make sure your CNAME record points to the Edge Services endpoint in the format `bucket-name.edge.scw.cloud`, and that you have replaced `bucket-name` with the name of your bucket.                                            |
| Domain does not exist                     | You must own the domain name you are attempting to configure. If you do not already own the domain name, you cannot create a CNAME record for it. Register the domain name, for example using our [Domains and DNS](/network/domains-and-dns/how-to/register-internal-domain/) product, then create a CNAME record for it.                                           |

There are also a number of errors which can occur if you attempt to use an invalid subdomain:

| Error message                             | Solution                                                            |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Subdomain error - invalid format          | Make sure the subdomain name you entered is correctly formatted.              |
| Subdomain error - cannot use `scw.cloud`  | You cannot use `scw.cloud` as your subdomain. Pick another subdomain.          |
| Subdomain error - invalid TLD             | Make sure the Top-Level Domain (e.g. `.com`, `.fr`) you entered is correct.   |
