Routes allow your IoT Hub to forward messages to non-MQTT destinations.

Currently, the following routes are available:

 - **REST route** allowing you to call a REST API with the content of your messages.
 - **Database route** allowing you execute queries on a PostgreSQL or MySQL database with the content of your messages.
 - **Scaleway Object Storage route** allowing you to store your messages in your Scaleway [Object Storage](https://www.scaleway.com/en/object-storage/) bucket.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
