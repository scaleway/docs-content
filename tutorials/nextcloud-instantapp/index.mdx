In this tutorial, we show you how to deploy your personal cloud storage with the [NextCloud](https://www.nextcloud.com) InstantApp in seconds. NextCloud allows you to create a self-hosted cloud storage to host files, folders, contacts, photo galleries, calendars, and more on your Instance.

Scaleway's NextCloud image is based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish), the NextCloud application, MariaDB as the database engine, and it uses database tuning according to [NextCloud's official recommendations](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/27/admin_manual/configuration_database/linux_database_configuration.html#configuring-a-mysql-or-mariadb-database). By default, this image supports [routed IPs](/compute/instances/api-cli/using-routed-ips/).

## Configuring NextCloud

When the Instance is running, you can see the Instance's IP address in the server list on the control panel.

1. Copy the IP address and open an [SSH session](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance) to find the database credentials required for NextCloud.
2. The MySQL user, password, and database name are shown in the MOTD message that displays upon your first connection to the server:
    ```
    ################### NEXTCLOUD ###################
    Nextcloud version 27.0.2 is installed in /var/www/html/nextcloud.

    Getting started with: https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/tutorials/nextcloud-instantapp/

    Before configuring your NextCloud, you must bind it to a relational database.
    A MySQL database is running locally. You can connect using the following credentials:
    Database user: nextcloud
    Database password: 07661dd3ec51560369c3dbb606b0e35c86da476a
    Database name: nextcloud_db

    You can also connect to any other external database supported by Nextcloud (see
    https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/27/admin_manual/configuration_database/linux_database_configuration.html).

    Go to http://01e090cd-e0f4-4b5e-b035-5fda387535ed.pub.instances.scw.cloud/nextcloud, fill the form with your database information
    and your desired user.

    You can hide this message for the next connections by deleting the /etc/update-motd.d/70-nextcloud file.
    #################################################
    ```
3. Open a web browser and enter the NextCloud URL from the MOTD in the navigation bar. NextCloud's installation script displays.
4. Enter a username and password (of your choice) as well as the database credentials shown in the MOTD of your Instance. Leave the database host as `localhost`. Then click **Install**.

## Log in to NextCloud

Once the installation completes, you are redirected to the login page. Enter the username and password you set previously and press **Enter** on your keyboard.

<Message type="tip">
  After completing the NextcCloud installation, your browser may navigate to an incorrect URL. A quick workaround is to click the "Back" button in the browser to access the NextCloud login page.
</Message>

You are now connected to your personal cloud storage and can start using it.

## Opening the mail ports to send emails

 <Message type="note">
  In order to prevent spam, our infrastructure does not allow access to remote mail ports by default. However, NextCloud requires the ability to send emails, so you must enable access to these ports. Your account needs to undergo a validation process before you can enable the SMTP ports. [Learn more about identity verification](/console/account/how-to/verify-identity).
</Message>

1. Click the **Security groups** tab on the Instances overview page.
2. Click **Create a new security group** and input the security group name and description.
3. Check the **Enable SMTP** box to unblock the mail ports.
4. Return to the overview tab and select the security group you created in step 2.

    The new security group configuration is automatically applied to the Instances.
