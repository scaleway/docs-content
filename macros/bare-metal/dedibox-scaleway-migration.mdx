  Only users who have linked their Dedibox account to the Scaleway console before XX Month XXXX can manage their resources from both consoles. If you did not complete this process, you can use the **[Dedibox console](https://console.online.net)** to place orders, manage your Dediboxes, and access the [related documentation](/dedibox/quickstart/).
