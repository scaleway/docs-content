## Rancher Overview

Rancher is an open-source container management platform providing a graphical interface making container management easier.

The Rancher UI makes it easy to manage secrets, roles, and permissions. It allows you to scale nodes and pods and set up load balancers without requiring a command line tool or editing hard to read YAML files.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).
  - You have [configured your SSH key](/console/project/how-to/create-ssh-key/).
  - You have configured a domain name (i.e. `rancher.example.com`) pointing to the first Instance.
</Message>

### Spinning up the required Instances

1. Log into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).
2. Click **Instances** in the menu on the left.
3. To deploy Instances with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) preinstalled, click **+ Create Instance**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-rancher_instances.webp" alt="" />
4. Click the **InstantApps** tab, and choose the **Docker** image:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-rancher_instant_apps.webp" alt="" />
5. Choose a region, type, and a name for your Instance (i.e. `rancher1`), then click **Create Instance**.
6. Repeat these steps two more times to spin up a total of three Instances running Docker.

### Installing Rancher

1. Log into the first Instance (`rancher1`) via [SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).
2. Launch the following command to fetch the docker image `rancher/rancher` to run in a container with automatic restarting enabled, in case the container fails. Edit the value `rancher.example.com` with the personalized domain name pointing to the Instance to generate a Let's Encrypt certificate automatically:
    ```
    docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -v /host/rancher:/var/lib/rancher rancher/rancher --acme-domain rancher.example.com
    ```

### Configuring Rancher

1. Once Rancher is installed, open a web browser and point it to your Rancher domain (i.e. `https://rancher.example.com`). The following page displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-rancher_password.webp" alt="" />
2. Enter a password and its confirmation, and click **Continue** to move forward with the installation.
4. The (empty) Rancher dashboard displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-rancher_dashboard_empty.webp" alt="" />

### Creating a cluster

1. Click **Add Cluster** to configure a new Kubernetes cluster.
2. The cluster creation page displays. Click **Custom** to deploy the cluster on the already launched Scaleway Instances.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-rancher_add_cluster.webp" alt="" />
3. Enter a name for the cluster, choose the desired Kubernetes version and network provider and select **None** as cloud provider.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-rancher_cluster_options.webp" alt="" />
4. Choose the options for the worker nodes. A Kubernetes cluster must have at least one `etcd` and one `control plane`.
    - `etcd` is a key value storage system used by Kubernetes to keep the state of the entire environment. For redundancy, we recommend running an odd number of copies of the etcd (e.g. 1, 3, 5…).
    - The Kubernetes `control plane` maintains a record of all objects (i.e. pods) in a cluster and updates then with the configuration provided in the Rancher admin interface.
    - Kubernetes `workers` run the actual workloads and monitoring tools to ensure the healthiness of the containers. All pod deployments happen on the worker node.

    Choose the roles for each of the Instances in the cluster and run the command shown on the page to install the required software and link them with Rancher:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-rancher_node_run.webp" alt="" />

    Once all Instances are ready, click **Done** to initialize the cluster.
5. Once the cluster is ready, the dashboard displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-rancher_dashboard.webp" alt="" />

### Deploying a cluster workload

The cluster is now ready, and the deployment of a first pod can take place. A [pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/) is the smallest and simplest execution unit of a Kubernetes application that you can create or deploy.

1. Head over **Global** in the header bar, select the cluster and click **Default** from the drop-down menu:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-rancher_menu.webp" alt="" />
2. The clusters dashboard displays. Click **Deploy**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-rancher_dashboard.webp" alt="" />
3. Enter the details of the workload:
    - **Name**: A friendly name for the workload.
    - **Docker Image**: Enter [`nginxdemos/hello`](https://hub.docker.com/r/nginxdemos/hello/) to deploy a [Nginx](http://nginx.org/) demo application.
    - Click **Add port** to configure the [port mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding).
      - **Publish the container port**: Set the value to port `80`
      - **Protocol**: Set the value to `TCP`
      - **As a**: Set the Value to `NodePort`
      - **Listening port**: Set the value to port `30000`

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-deploy_workload.webp" alt="" />

    Click **Launch** to create the workload.
4. Once deployed, open a web browser and point it to `http://<rancher.example.com>:30000/`. The Nginx demo application displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-nginx_demo_app.webp" alt="" />

### Scaling a cluster workload

Currently, the Nginx demo application lives in a single pod and is deployed only on one Instance. Rancher provides the possibility to scale your deployment to multiple pods directly from the web interface.

1. From the cluster dashboard, click **…**. Then, click **Edit** in the pop-up menu:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-workload_edit.webp" alt="" />
2. Edit the Workload type and set the number of scalable deployments to **3**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-upgrade_service.webp" alt="" />
3. Click **Save**. Rancher will now send instructions to Kubernetes to update the workload configuration and to deploy 3 pods running the Nginx demo application in parallel.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-workload_updated.webp" alt="" />
4. Access the application running on the second Instance by typing: `http://<second_instance_ip>:30000/` in a web browser. The Nginx demo application displays.

    For more information about [Rancher](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) refer to the official documentation.
