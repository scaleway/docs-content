On our web hosting offers, you can link an additional domain name as an alias to your website. For example, you have the domain name `mydomainname.fr` and `mydomainname.com`, and you want that the same website is visible at both domain names.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net)
  - You have created a **Webhosting Classic**
</Message>

1. From your Dedibox console, click **Hosting**. A list of your webhosting accounts displays.
2. Click **Manage** next to the hosting you want to configure. The webhosting overview page displays.
3. Click **Add Domain** in the **Additionnal domain names** section of the overview page. 
4. Enter the domain name that you want to add to your hosting in the search bar and click **Search**. The search result displays.

      If your domain name is not registered yet, you can order it. If it is already registered and with another registrar, you can transfer it to Scaleway.

5. Click the **Order** button to continue. The list of hosting offers displays.
6. Select **Hosting alias** from the list of offers. Select the hosting you want to link the domain name to from the drop-down list. Then click **Order**. An order summary displays.
