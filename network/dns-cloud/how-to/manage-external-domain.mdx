Once your external domains have been created and validated, you can manage them from the Scaleway console.

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) 
- You have [linked your domain](/network/dns-cloud/how-to/add-external-domain) with Scaleway DNS

</Message>

1. Click **DNS** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The DNS zone dashboard displays.

2. Click <Icon name="more" />, then **More info** next to the domain you want to manage.

The **Domain Information** page displays. This gives you an overview of the status of your domain, as well as a list of all nameservers associated with it. At the bottom of the page you also have the option of deleting your domain from Scaleway DNS.
