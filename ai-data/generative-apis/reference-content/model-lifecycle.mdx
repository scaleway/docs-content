Scaleway is dedicated to updating and offering the latest versions of generative AI models, ensuring improvements in capabilities, accuracy, and safety.

As new versions of models are introduced, you have the opportunity to explore them through the Scaleway Console.

A model provided through Scaleway Generative APIs may be classified into one of these statuses: `Active`, `Deprecated`, or `End-of-Life` (EOL).

- Active: This status indicates that the model version is under continuous development by the provider, with ongoing updates that may include bug fixes and enhancements.
- Deprecated: A model version is designated as deprecated when a newer, more efficient version is available. Scaleway assigns an EOL date to these Deprecated versions. Although Deprecated versions remain usable, it's recommended to transition to an Active version by the EOL date.
- EOL: At this stage, the model version is retired and no longer accessible for use. Any attempts to utilize an EOL version will not be successful.
