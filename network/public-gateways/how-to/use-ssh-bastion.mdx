SSH bastion is a server dedicated to managing connections to the infrastructure behind your Public Gateway. When you activate SSH bastion on your Public Gateway, all the SSH keys held in your Project credentials are imported to the SSH bastion, providing a single point of entry. This makes management of your infrastructure easier and more secure.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created a Public Gateway](/network/public-gateways/how-to/create-a-public-gateway)
</Message>

## How to activate SSH bastion

1. Click **Public Gateways** in the **Network** section of the Scaleway console side menu.
2. Click the Public Gateway for which you want to activate SSH bastion. You are taken to the **Overview** page for that Public Gateway.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-ssh-bastion-activate.webp" alt="" />
3. Under **SSH Bastion** click the **Activate** button. A pop-up displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-activate-ssh-bastion-popup.webp" alt="" />
4. Enter the port that you want your SSH bastion to listen on (or leave the default port in place).
    <Message type="tip">
      The default port is 61000. When setting your own port, you must choose a port number between 1024 and 59999. The port that the SSH bastion listens on must not be a port already in use by a [NAT rule](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#nat).

5. Copy the SSH configuration displayed at the bottom of the screen, and click **Save settings**.

    You are redirected to your Public Gateway's **Overview** page, where SSH bastion is now activated. All the SSH keys in your [Project credentials](/console/my-project/concepts/#credentials) at the time of activation are copied to the SSH bastion.

## How to reimport SSH keys

If you add new SSH keys to your [Project credentials](/console/my-project/concepts/#credentials) after activating SSH bastion, you will need to perform a reimport to update the bastion with the new keys.

1. Click **Public Gateways** in the **Network** section of the Scaleway console side menu.
2. Click the Public Gateway for which you want to update the SSH bastion. You are taken to the **Overview** page for that Public Gateway.
3. Under **SSH Bastion** click the **Reimport SSH keys** button.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-ssh-bastion-reimport.webp" alt="" />
    
    Your SSH bastion is updated with the new SSH keys.

## How to connect to a resource behind your SSH bastion

In this section, we use the example of a Public Gateway attached to a Private Network, with different resources (Instances, Elastic Metal servers etc) attached to the Private Network. SSH bastion has been activated on the Public Gateway, listening on port 61000.  

### How to connect using the resource's fully-qualified domain name (FQDN)

Your FQDN takes the form `instance-name.private-network-name`/

Carry out the following command on your terminal to connect to a resource inside your Private Network. In this case, we want to connect to an Instance:

```bash
ssh -J bastion@PUBLIC_IP_OF_PUBLIC_GATEWAY:61000 user@instance-name.private-network-name
```

### How to edit your SSH configuration files for connection

The following steps must be repeated on all local machines that want to connect to a resource behind the SSH bastion.

1. Copy the SSH configuration code for your SSH bastion to your clipboard. If you did not copy it when activating your SSH bastion, return to the Public Gateway's **Overview** tab and click **Copy code** under the **SSH configuration** section of the SSH bastion panel:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-ssh-bastion-reimport.webp" alt="" />
2. To configure at user/local level, open your user SSH configuration file on your local machine with a text-editor such as `nano`: 
    ```bash
    nano ~/.ssh/config
    ```
  
  Paste the code into the file, then save and exit. Code for our example may look as follows:

  ```bash
  Host *.my-private-network
    ProxyJump bastion@PUBLIC_IP_OF_PUBLIC_GATEWAY:61000
  ```
3. Alternatively, to configure at system-wide level, open your system-wide configuration file on your local machine with a text-editor such as `nano`: 
    ```bash
    nano /etc/ssh/ssh_config
    ```

  Paste the code into the file, then save and exit.
4. Carry out the following command on your terminal to connect to a resource inside your Private Network using your FQDN. In this case we want to connect to an Instance, so the FQDN is `instance-name.private-network-name`:
    ```bash
    ssh instance-name.private-network-name
    ```

## How to edit or deactivate SSH bastion

1. Click **Public Gateways** in the **Network** section of the Scaleway console side menu.
2. Click the Public Gateway for which you want to edit or deactivate SSH bastion. You are taken to the **Overview** page for that Public Gateway.
3. Under **SSH Bastion** click the <Icon name="edit" /> **Edit** button. A pop-up displays.
4. Edit your SSH bastion as required. You can make the following edits:
    - Use the <Icon name="toggle" /> toggle to disable SSH bastion.
    - Change the port on which your SSH bastion listens.
5. Click **Save settings**.

    Your edits are saved and you are redirected to your Public Gateway's **Overview** page.
