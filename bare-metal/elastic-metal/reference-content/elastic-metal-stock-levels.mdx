The Elastic Metal API and the Scaleway console may display stock levels for Elastic Metal servers. Below are the available stock level statuses:

- **Available**: Indicates that there is sufficient stock available to meet the demand for this offer.
- **Low Stock**: Indicates a reduced stock level. Typically, this means there are 5 or fewer machines of this offer available. However, there are exceptions:
  - For EM-T210E-NVME, the threshold is 2 machines.
  - For EM-T510X-NVME, the threshold is 1 machine.
- **Temporarily out of stock**: Signifies that the offer is currently sold out. Restocking will occur as soon as possible.
  <Message type="note">
    If an offer is **temporarily out of stock**, the API response will be `"stock" : "empty"`.
  </Message>
