We have created a Python framework that allows you to easily create and deploy an API on Serverless Functions using Python annotations. You can even add an API Gateway hosted on Serverless Containers to manage routing from a single base URL.&nbsp;

To deploy an example application with the self-hosted API gateway, refer to our official [GitHub examples repository](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-examples/tree/main/functions/serverless-gateway-python#using-serverless-gateway-and-serverless-apis/).
