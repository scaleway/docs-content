Super-resolution is the process of enhancing the details of a low-resolution image to recover a high-resolution image. In the context of deep learning, the technique consists of taking a low-resolution image as input, passing it through a neural network, and receiving an output that is a higher resolution version of the input.

The neural network upscales the image by filling in the finer details based on the knowledge it obtained in the training process.

One of the ways to train a model is to use a training dataset. It consists of downscaling high-resolution images as the input and the high-resolution images themselves as the output. This method is also known as the **ground truth**.

After the model has been trained, a separate test set should be used to guarantee the model's performance on images that were not part of the initial dataset.

In this tutorial, we will show you how to prepare your data, construct the **sub-pixel convolutional** neural network, train it and test it using a Scaleway [GPU instance](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers/create).

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />
 
<Message type="requirement">
  - You have a [GPU instance](https://www.scaleway.com/en/gpu-3070-instances/) running on UbuntuML
  - You have sudo privileges or access to the root user
  - You have [configured Jupyter Notebook on your GPU instance](/tutorials/setup-jupyter-notebook/)
</Message>

## Preparing the Data

1. Import the training set from your local machine to your remote Instance directory, before you begin setting up your data pipeline. You can use `scp` to do so, with the following command:
    <Message type="note">
      We assume that you have previously created train and test directories within the directory being transferred.
    </Message>

    ```
    scp -r <path-localhost> root@<host>:<path-remotehost>/
    ```
    
    <Message type="important">
      Replace `<path-localhost>` with the path to the directory you dataset is located in your local host. In `root@<host>` replace `<host>` with your remote GPU instance's IP address. `<path-remotehost>` should be replaced with the path you wish to save your datasets in your GPU instance.
    </Message>
2. [Open a Jupyter Notebook](/tutorials/setup-jupyter-notebook/#using-jupyter-notebook) to begin setting up your data.
3. Copy and paste the following code.
    - To import the libraries:
      ```
      from __future__ import print_function, division

      import time
      import os
      import numpy as np
      import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

      from PIL import Image

      from torchvision import transforms, utils
      import torchvision

      device = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'

      # The Super Resolution model will work for images of arbitrary size, but will
      # be optimized for images with dimensions equal to:
      image_size = 60

      # The factor by which the image size should increase after Super Resolution:
      scaleup = 2
      ```
    - To set directory paths for the training and test data sets.
      Replace `./Path/train` with the path to your training dataset and `./Path/test` with the path to the testing dataset.

      ```
      # Set directory paths for the training and test data sets:
      # the directories' structure does not matter, as long as they contain image files
      traindir = './Path/train'
      testdir = './Path/test/'
      ```

      ```
      # For best performance, only images whose original size is at least image_size x scaleup
      # will be included in the training set. This will be checked here:
