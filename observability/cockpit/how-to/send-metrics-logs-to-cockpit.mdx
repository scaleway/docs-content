This page shows you how to send [metrics](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#metric) and [logs](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#logs) to your [Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#cockpit). You can push metrics with any `Prometheus Remote Write` compatible agent such as the [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/) or [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) agents.
You can push logs with any Loki compatible agent such as the [Promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/), [Fluentd](https://docs.fluentd.org/), [Fluent Bit](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/) or [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/introduction.html) agents.

<Macro id="requirements" />

 - A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
 - [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
 - Configured an agent. Read our dedicated [documentation](/observability/cockpit/api-cli/configuring-grafana-agent/) to find out how to configure the Grafana agent.


<Message type="important">
 - Having the default configuration on your agents might lead to more of your resources' metrics being sent, a high consumption, and a high bill at the end of the month.
 - Sending metrics and logs for Scaleway resources or personal data using an external path is a billable feature. In addition, any data that you push yourself is billed, even if you send data from Scaleway products. Refer to the [product pricing](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/?tags=available,managedservices-observability-cockpit) for more information.

## Send metrics and logs to your Cockpit

1. Click **Cockpit** in the Observability section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Cockpit** overview page displays.
2. [Create a token](/observability/cockpit/how-to/create-token) with the **Push** permission for metrics and logs.
    <Message type="important">
     - Make sure that you create your token in the same region as the [data sources](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#data-sources) you want to use it for.
     - Make sure that you copy your token's secret key and save it before you exit the page.
    </Message>
3. Configure your applications to send metrics and logs to your Cockpit [endpoints](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#endpoints), using your newly created token for authentication.

    <Message type="important">
     - The `Prometheus Remote Write` endpoint to push your metrics is the following: `https://metrics.cockpit.fr-par.scw.cloud/api/v1/push`
     - The Remote Write endpoint to push your logs is the following: `https://logs.cockpit.fr-par.scw.cloud/loki/api/v1/push`
    </Message>
4. [Log in to your Grafana account](/observability/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards).
5. Create your [Grafana dashboard](/observability/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards) and start monitoring your data.



    ## Sending Python logs to Cockpit

    1. Open a terminal and run `pip install python-logging-loki` or `pip3 install python-logging-loki` if you are using Python 3, to install the [logging_loki](https://pypi.org/project/python-logging-loki/) package to send your Python logs.
    2. [Create a token](/observability/cockpit/how-to/create-token) with the **Push** permission for logs.
    3. Copy and save the following code snippet into a text editor. Make sure that you replace `$SCW_SECRET_KEY` and `$COCKPIT_TOKEN` with your values.

      ```
      import logging
      import logging_loki
      import time

      handler = logging_loki.LokiHandler(
          url="https://logs.cockpit.fr-par.scw.cloud/loki/api/v1/push",
          tags={"job": "logs_from_python"},
          auth=("$SCW_SECRET_KEY", "$COCKPIT_TOKEN"),
          version="1",

      )

      logger = logging.getLogger("my-first-python-logger")
      logger.addHandler(handler)

      def main():
          # Start generating log messages
          for i in range(10):
              logger.error(f"Error message {i}")
              time.sleep(1)

      if __name__ == "__main__":
          main()



                )
      ```
      This script sets up a logger that sends error log messages to the Loki endpoint in Cockpit. It then generates 10 error log messages with a one-second delay between each message. These log messages are sent to Cockpit and can be viewed and analyzed via the Grafana dashboard we will create in the next part.

      <Message type="tip">
        If you are using the Scaleway Loki API, you can `POST` through the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, or `POST` using the following endpoint: `https://api_key:YOUR_COCKPIT_TOKEN@logs.cockpit.fr-par.scw.cloud/loki/api/v1/push`.

  ### Creating a Grafana dashboard and visualizing your Python logs

    1. [Log into Grafana](/observability/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards/) using your [Grafana credentials](/observability/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/).
    2. Click the **Home** icon, then click **Dashboards**.
    3. Click **New** in the top right corner of your screen and **Import** to import your Grafana dashboard.
    4. Load the URL of the premade [Grafana Log Viewer Dashboard for Loki](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/13639-logs-app/) or enter `13639` in the ID field.

      Your log lines from the Python snippet should display in the dashboard.
