Scaleway Generative APIs are designed as drop-in replacement for the OpenAI APIs.
Using the Models API, it is easy to list the various AI models available at Scaleway.

## List models

Lists the available models, and provides basic information about each one.

```

     --url "https://api.scaleway.ai/v1/models" \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer ${SCW_SECRET_KEY}"
```
