A **B**order **G**ateway **P**rotocol (BGP) community is a group of IP prefixes that share a common attribute.

Scaleway recognizes three BGP communities, and applies routing priorities based on the community applied. This lets you influence routing between the various Interlinks in a VPC, for traffic flowing from Scaleway to your external network.

For each prefix that you advertise from your external/on-premises router over a BGP session, you can apply one of the following community tags to indicate the priority of the associated path for returning traffic:

- `12876:42050` — Low preference
- `12876:42100` — Medium preference
- `12876:42200` — High preference

These BGP communities are evaluated in order from lowest to highest preference, where the highest preference is preferred. They are mutually exclusive, meaning you can only apply one of them per prefix.

To apply these communities, you must configure your BGP router or software to add the appropriate community to the routes you advertise.

You cannot add communities to prefixes advertised by your Scaleway VPC towards your external/on-premises router.
