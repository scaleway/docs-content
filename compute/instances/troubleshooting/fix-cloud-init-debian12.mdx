Debian 12 (Bookworm) Instances created prior to 2023-06-22 were delivered with a version of `cloud-init` preinstalled that came with a wrong user configuration made by the custom-built upstream `cloud-init 23.2`.<br />

The issue has been fixed for Instances created past the above mentioned date. The Debian 12 image now uses the official Debian Unstable `cloud-init` package.<br />

Run the following commands to fix the issue on an Instance affected by this bug:
```
wget http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/pool/main/c/cloud-init/cloud-init_23.2-1_all.deb -O /tmp/cloud-init_23.2-1_all.deb

dpkg -i /tmp/cloud-init_23.2-1_all.deb

for FILE in /etc/group /etc/gshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow /etc/subgid /etc/subuid /etc/sudoers.d/90-cloud-init-users;
do
sed -i -e 's/Ubuntu/Debian/g' -e 's/ubuntu/debian/g' $FILE
done
```
