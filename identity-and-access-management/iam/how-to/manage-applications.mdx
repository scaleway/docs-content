You can manage IAM applications in an Organization if you are the [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) of that Organization, or if you have sufficient permissions (via [policies](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#policy)) to do so. Management actions including adding and removing IAM applications to/from groups, attaching and detaching policies to/from applications, generating, viewing and deleting applications' API keys and deleting applications from the Organization.

## How to access the application overview

1. Click **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** from the top-right of your [Organization Dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) in the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/applications) displays.

2. Click the **Applications** tab. A list of the Organization's IAM applications displays.
3. Click the name of the application you want to manage. Alternatively, click <Icon name="more" /> next to the application, and select **Overview**. Either way, you are taken to the application's **Overview** tab.
    Follow the steps below depending on the management action you wish to take.

## How to view application information

From the application's [Overview tab](#how-to-access-the-application-overview), you can view information including the application's **ID**, **description**, and their **creation date**.

On this page you can also find an extensive list of the application's permission sets, the name of their associated policies and the scope they apply to.

## How to manage an application's groups

From the application's [Overview tab](#how-to-access-the-application-overview), scroll down to the **Groups** panel. A list of the groups the application is part of displays.

### Remove an application from a group

1. Click the **x** button next to the group you want to remove the application from. A pop-up displays asking you to confirm the action.
2. Click **Remove from group** to confirm.
    <Message type="important">
      Removing an application from a group means that any permissions given to it via the group (i.e. from an attached policy) will no longer apply. Be sure you want to remove these permissions from the application before proceeding.
    </Message>

### Add an application to another group

An application may be part of multiple groups at the same time.

1. Click **Add to group** to add the application to a group. A pop-up displays, prompting you to select a group.
2. Select the group you want to add the application to from the drop down list, or type the name of the group.
3. Click **Validate** to finish.
    The application is added to the selected group, and you are returned to the **Overview** tab.

## How to manage an application's policies

From the application's [**Overview** tab](#how-to-access-the-application-overview), scroll down to the **Policies** panel. A list of policies attached to the application displays.

### Detach a policy from an application

1. Click the **x** button next to the policy you want to detach from the application. A pop-up displays asking you to confirm the action.
2. Click **Detach policy** to confirm.
    <Message type="important">
      Since policies can only be attached to one [principal](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#principal) at a time, detaching a policy from the application means that the policy becomes orphaned. The policy will remain in your list of policies, but will have no effect until you attach it to another principal.
    </Message>

### Attach another policy to an application

An application may be attached to multiple policies.

1. Click **Attach a policy** to attach another policy to the application. A pop-up displays, prompting you to select a policy.
2. Select the policy you want to attach to the application from the drop down list, or type the name of the policy.
3. Click **Validate** to finish.
    The selected policy is attached to the application, and you are returned to the **Overview** tab.

## How to manage an application's API keys

### View and create API keys

1. From the application's [Overview tab](#how-to-access-the-application-overview), click the **API keys** tab.
    Here, you can view details of the application's [API keys](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/).
    If you want to create a new API key for an application, proceed to the following steps:
2. Click the <Icon name="plus" /> button to generate a new API key. The API key creation wizard displays.
3. Complete the information in the wizard. See our [dedicated documentation](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) if you need any help with this step.
4. Ensure you have securely saved the secret key, then close the window. You are returned to the **API keys** tab, where the new API key now appears in the list.

### Edit API keys

1. From the application's [Overview tab](#how-to-access-the-application-overview), click the **API keys** tab.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Edit** next to the API key you wish to edit.
3. Edit the description and/or [preferred Project](/identity-and-access-management/iam/api-cli/using-api-key-object-storage) of the API key as required, and click **Validate**.

The API key is edited, and you are returned to the list of API keys.

### Delete API keys

1. From the application's [Overview tab](#how-to-access-the-application-overview), click the **API keys** tab.
