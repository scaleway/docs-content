Splitting your /48 IPv6 prefix into smaller subnets (e.g., /56 or /64) allows you to assign unique IPv6 address ranges to individual servers or virtual machines (VMs) on your Dedibox infrastructure.
This enables better network organization, improved security through segmentation, and easier management of IP assignments across multiple devices or services. Each subnet has its own [DUID](/dedibox-ipv6/concepts/#duid) (DHCP Unique Identifier) and can be configured individually.

<Message type="note">
  * You can create as many /56 subnets as you have servers.
  * You can create as many /64 subnets as you have failover IPs.

<Requirements />

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- A [Dedibox dedicated server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox)
- [Requested](/dedibox-ipv6/how-to/request-prefix/) a /48 IPv6 prefix

1. Click **Server** > **Network configuration** in the Dedibox console. The network configuration pages displays. Scroll down to the IPv6 network configuration section.
2. Click the settings icon (cogwheel) next to your `/48` prefix. Then click **Create subnet**.

3. Select the subnet you want to create from the drop-down list. Then click **Create subnet**.

    The subnet is created and visible in the list of your IPv6 subnets along with its DUID.

<Message typ="tip">
  To create `/64` networks for virtual machines, repeat the steps above by clicking on the "cogweel" icon next to the `/56` subnet.
