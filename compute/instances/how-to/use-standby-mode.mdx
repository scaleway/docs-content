[Standby mode](/compute/instances/concepts/#stand-by-mode) temporarily stops an Instance. The Instance remains allocated to your account and all data remains on the local storage of the Instance.

<Message type="important">
  An Instance in standby mode is still considered as allocated to your account. This means you will be billed for the Instance, its storage and any flexible IP attached to it. Find out [when the billing of your Instance starts and stops](/faq/billing/#when-does-the-billing-of-an-instance-start-and-stop). See also [how to power off your Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/power-off-instance/).
