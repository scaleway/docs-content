<Message type="iam">
  If you have [activated IAM](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/activate-iam), the actions described on this page are outdated. 
  Refer to the [How to accept an invitation to an Organization](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/accept-invitation-to-orga/) documentation page for the equivalent procedure with IAM.
</Message>

All user accounts are [Organizations](/console/my-account/concepts/#organization). When you [create a Scaleway account](/console/my-account/how-to/create-an-account), you are the [Owner](/console/my-account/concepts/#owner) of your Organization. If you are invited to a pre-existing Organization, you will simultaneously be the Owner of your own Organization and whatever role defined by the Owner or [Administrator](/console/my-account/concepts/#administrator) who sent you the invitation.

When invited to join an Organization, you receive an email invitation.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have been invited to join an [Organization](/console/my-project/concepts/#organization)
</Message>

1. Click **Accept Invitation** from your email invitation. The Scaleway console opens in a browser window. A pop-up displays introducing you to the Organization.
2. Click **Next** to proceed. The Organization dashboard displays. 

    Optionally, you can activate your personal Organization:
3. Click the Organization name in the Organization menu.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-self-orga-name-min.webp" alt="" />

    <Message type="note">
      The Organization name is identical to the account Owner. 
      If the account was created without the Owner's name, it will be the prefix of the email used to create the account. 
      For example, if the email used is `myemail@example.com`, the Organization name will be `myemail`. In this case, the Organization name can be set to the account owner's name, but only once.
    </Message>

    A message displays asking you to **Check your email**.
4. Check your email and click **Verify**.
5. Click **I Agree to the Terms of Service and Scaleway's Data Protection Agreement** to confirm.

    The Scaleway console opens in the browser.
