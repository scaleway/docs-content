## What are the limits?

Any model served through Scaleway Generative APIs gets rate limited based on:
- Tokens per minute (total input and output tokens)
- Queries per minute (HTTP requests)
- Concurrent requests (total simultaneous HTTP sessions)

Base limits apply if you registered a valid payment method, and are increased automatically if you also [verify your identity](/account/how-to/verify-identity/).

Exact limit values are detailed in [Organization quotas for Generative APIs](/organizations-and-projects/additional-content/organization-quotas/#generative-apis).

<Message type="tip">
If you created a Scaleway account but did not register a valid payment method, stricter limits apply to ensure usage stays within Free Tier only.
</Message>

## How can I increase the rate limits?

We actively monitor usage and will improve rates based on feedback.
If you need to increase your rate limits:
- [Verify your identity](/account/how-to/verify-identity/) to automatically increase your rate limit as described below
- Use [Managed Inference](https://console.scaleway.com/inference/deployments), which provides dedicated capacity and does not enforce rate limits (you remain limited by the total provisioned capacity)
- Contact your existing Scaleway account manager or our Sales team to discuss volume commitment for specific models that will allow us to increase your quota proportionally.

## Why do we set rate limits?

These limits safeguard against abuse or misuse of Scaleway Generative APIs, helping to ensure fair access to the API with consistent performance.
