## KVM over IP

KVM Over IP is a hardware-based solution that enables remote access to the **k**eyboard, **v**ideo (screen), and **m**ouse ports of a physical server. A unit plugs into these ports and transmits their signals to a connected user through a network. This allows access to the machine even if the installed OS is not working properly, and opens up possibilities for debugging and more.

## iDRAC

The **I**ntegrated **D**ell **R**emote **A**ccess **C**ontroller is the hardware allowing KVM Over IP and other management and monitoring features for Dell servers.

## iLO card

The **I**ntegrated **L**ights-**O**ut card is the hardware allowing KVM Over IP and other management and monitoring features for HP servers.

## IPMI

The **I**ntelligent **P**latform **M**anagement **I**nterface (IPMI) is a set of computer interface specifications for an autonomous computer subsystem that provides management and monitoring capabilities independently of the host system's CPU, firmware (BIOS or UEFI), and operating system. IPMI is often integrated into server motherboards or management cards (e.g., iDRAC, iLO) and supports features such as:

- Remote power control (on, off, reboot)
- Monitoring hardware health (temperature, fan speed, voltage)
- Event logging (e.g., system errors or alerts)
- Remote console access (often paired with KVM over IP)

IPMI operates over a network using protocols like UDP and can be accessed via tools like IPMItool or vendor-specific interfaces. It enhances KVM over IP by providing additional management functions beyond keyboard, video, and mouse control.

## ISO file

An ISO file, or ISO image, is an archive file containing an exact copy of data from an optical disc (e.g., CD, DVD). Named after the ISO 9660 file system commonly used for optical media, ISO files are widely used for distributing operating systems, software, or firmware. In the context of KVM over IP:

- ISO files can be mounted remotely via virtual media features in iDRAC, iLO, or other KVM devices, allowing administrators to install operating systems or run diagnostics without physical media.
- The remote server “sees” the ISO file as a local disc, enabling seamless OS installation or recovery.
- ISO files are often hosted on vendor-specific repositories or internal servers for easy access.
