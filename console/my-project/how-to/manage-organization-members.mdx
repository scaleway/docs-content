A list of the members that belong or have been invited to an [Organization](/console/my-account/concepts#organization) is available in the [**Members** tab of the Organization page](https://console.scaleway.com/account/organization/users).

[Owners](/console/my-account/concepts#owner) and [Administrators](/console/my-account/concepts#administrator) can add members and check information such as the date of their last login and whether their two-factor authentication is activated, but only the Owner can delete or change the role of a member.

## How to invite Members 

Users can be added to Organizations through the Scaleway console in two ways:

1. **Option 1**: On the **Organization Account** page, click **+ Add user**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-add-user-on-orga-account-page.png" alt="" />

  **Option 2**: On the Members tab, click <Icon name="plus" />.

  In both cases a pop-up requesting the emails and roles of new users displays.

2. Enter the email addresses of the users you wish to invite. 

  <Message type="important">

    If you invite more than one user make sure the corresponding email addresses are separated by a line break. 

  </Message>

3. Select a role for the user(s) in the drop down menu and click **Add User(s)** to confirm.

An invitation will automatically be sent to the listed email addresses. 

## How to manage Member invitations

Owners and Administrators can manage invitations sent to members on the Members tab.

1. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Send invitation again** next to the Member name on the Member list.

2. Click the **Send Invitation** button to send a new invitation to the selected user.
