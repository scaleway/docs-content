## Serverless Containers

Serverless Containers is a fully managed service that enables you to run containerized applications in a scalable and serverless environment.

It automatically handles infrastructure management, scaling, and load balancing, allowing you to focus on writing code without worrying about servers or clusters. Serverless Containers supports any language, framework, or binary that can run in a container, and it integrates seamlessly with other Scaleway services, making it ideal for deploying modern, event-driven, and API-based applications.

Refer to the [Serverless Containers Quickstart](/serverless-containers/quickstart/) for more information on how to deploy and use a container.

## Serverless Functions

Serverless Functions are fully managed compute services that allow you to run small, stateless code snippets or functions in response to HTTP requests or events.

These functions automatically scale based on demand and are designed to be lightweight, event-driven, and easily deployable, eliminating the need to worry about infrastructure management. Functions is built on top of Serverless Containers, meaning you can run your functions packaged in containers and have them scale efficiently.

Refer to the [Serverless Functions Quickstart](/serverless-functions/quickstart/) for more information on how to deploy and invoke a function.

## Serverless Jobs

Serverless Jobs are similar to Serverless Containers but are better suited for running longer workloads. See [the comparison between Serverless products](/serverless-containers/reference-content/difference-jobs-functions-containers) for more information.

Refer to the [Serverless Jobs Quickstart](/serverless-jobs/quickstart/) for more information on how to create and execute a job.
