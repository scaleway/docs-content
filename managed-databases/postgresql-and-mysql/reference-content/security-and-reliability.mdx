This page outlines key principles and best practices to help you navigate the complexities of cloud security and reliability effectively through shared responsibility.

## Resilience

Resilience ensures the continuity and availability of your applications and data, even in the face of disruptions or failures. In Managed Databases for PostgreSQL and MySQL, you can promote resilience through the following pillars: availability, durability, backups and snapshots, failover, data restoration, and Read Replicas.

### Availability and durability

Managed Databases for PostgreSQL and MySQL targets the following SLOs for their configuration types:

| Configuration Type | Configuration Details  | Availability |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ------ |
| High availability       | A secondary node with an up-to-date replica of the Database Instance takes over requests if the primary node fails. | 99.95%    |
| Standalone    | The Database Instance is provisioned on a single node. | 99.5%    |

### Backups and snapshots

You can configure your snapshots and/or backup settings to automate actions. When you define execution time, frequency, and expiration, you automate the creation and deletion of snapshots and backups. Creation happens at the defined frequency and deletion happens when resources reach their expiration date.

Refer to the [How to enable Autobackup](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/enable-autobackup/) documentation page for more information.

## Data restoration

You can restore your backups and snapshots anytime. The restoration is triggered by you, and Scaleway then automatically executes the restore operation.

Keep in mind that:
  - If you restore a backup to a Database Instance already containing data, the existing data overwritten by the backup data will not be recoverable.
  - Snapshot or backup restore operations can take some time, depending on the following factors:
    - Snapshots are disk "pictures" which contain all ready-to-use data structures for PostgreSQL and MySQL. Restoring a snapshot should usually take a few minutes, but can take longer depending on your Database Instance size and disk size.
    - Backups are logical backups of a database and only "raw" data from tables. Restoring a backup requires recreating objects such as indexes. Depending on the number of indexes, total data size, and database size, the restore operations can take from a few minutes to several hours.

Refer to the [How to manage backups](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/manage-manual-backups/#how-to-restore-backups) and the [How to manage snapshots](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/manage-snapshots/#how-to-create-a-database-instance-from-a-snapshot) documentation pages for more information.

## Failover

If you use [High Availability](#availability-and-durability) as your Database Instance configuration type, whenever the primary node becomes unavailable, a failover will be performed automatically after the unavailability is detected.

### Read Replicas

A Read Replica is a live copy of a Database Instance that behaves like an Instance, but that only allows read-only connections. The replica mirrors the data of the primary Database node and any changes made are replicated to the replica asynchronously.

Creating, deleting and promoting a Read Replica are actions performed by you. Scaleway then automatically creates, deletes or promotes the Read Replica.

  <Message type="note">
    The time it takes to create the Read Replica depends on the volume of data being replicated.
  </Message>

When [promoting a Read Replica](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/manage-read-replica/#how-to-promote-a-read-replica) to a main node, make sure that the main node has completed all ongoing operations and that the Read Replica lag is down to zero before promoting it.

If ongoing operations are not complete before the promote operation starts, some operations from the main node might not be contained in the newly promoted node.

Refer to the [How to manage Read Replicas](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/manage-read-replica/#how-to-promote-a-read-replica) documentation page for more information.



## Logging and Monitoring

Database default logs and metrics are stored inside **Cockpit**. This includes:
- **Metrics**: CPU, Memory, Disk usage, Replication Lag and Number of connections. Metrics are refreshed each minute.
- **Logs**:
    - PostgreSQL logs at a default level `log_error_verbosity="VERBOSE"` ([see PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-logging.html#GUC-LOG-ERROR-VERBOSITY)). Every request longer than 5 seconds is also logged (parameter `log_min_duration_statement` is set at `5000` and cannot be changed. For further logging details, you can activate [pgaudit extension](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/api-cli/pg-audit/).
    - MySQL logs at a default level `log_error_verbosity=2` ([see MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_log_error_verbosity)). Logging slow queries is not activated by default, but you can activate using `slow_query_log` and `long_query_time`.Â 

Any change performed to default log verbosity levels and threshold can lead to an increase in storage size which might make your database unavailable. These potential impacts on the database hence remain your responsibility.


### Disk full
You remain responsible for monitoring disk size growth and performing the required disk size increase. Once full, a database will switch to `disk_full` state and only accept read requests. To solve the issue, you can either increase disk volume size or clear out data from your database. Further details: [Dealing with disk_full mode in a Database Instance](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/troubleshooting/disk-full/)

### Database performance
We provide default configuration optimizing database performance for standard workloads, monitor and solve issues caused by hardware, operating system or file system level failures.
You remain however responsible for:
- Performance impacts from SQL queries or database-specific configuration you have performed (such as creating indexes, triggering backups or changing advanced settings such as `max_connections`).
- Sizing the Database Instance appropriately for your workload.

## Configuration and version management

### Database instance configuration
We provide default database configuration proven for standard use cases and restrict some options to ensure reliability. You can still modify some advanced configuration parameters (such as `effective_cache_size` or `max_connections` in PostgreSQL), but you are responsible for any impact on your database availability or performance.

### Version management
- **Minor versions**: We performed automatically minor version upgrades (within the same major version). These changes include security fixes and bug fixes and are designed to be backward compatible.
- **Major versions**: You can trigger major version upgrades on your Database Instance. Once you activate upgrade, we will create automatically a clone of your database with the chosen PostgreSQL version. Depending on the option you choose you might need to switch manually traffic to your newly created database and/or stop write operations on your source database. More details: [How to upgrade your Database Instance engine version](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/upgrade-version/)


### Database extensions
For security reasons, we support a defined set of [databases extensions for PostgreSQL](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/faq/databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/#which-postgresql-extensions-are-available). For security and reliability reasons, we only support a specific version of each extension for each PostgreSQL major version. This means we will only update an extension version in a new PostgreSQL major version that is supported. As extensions are usually less trusted components, we put in place several security measures to prevent privilege escalations from an extension. However, this extension is provided "as is". When installing and using an extension, you remain responsible for its usage, compatibility, and side effects with your database objects or existing users and queries.

## Data protection

### Encryption in transit
Managed Databases for PostgreSQL and MySQL supports SSL connections and lets customer downloads TLS certificates from Managed Databases.
You remain responsible for configuring SQL clients connecting to the database such as activating SSL in clients configuration options or renewing TLS certificate.

When used by SQL Clients, SSL connections will be performed end-to-end, i.e. from your SQL client up to the Database Instance executing SQL queries (Scaleway's components in between such as load balancers do not decrypt Managed Databases' traffic).

### Scaleway Access
In order to be able to perform maintenance operations and guarantee your database reliability or comply with local regulations, we keep the technical ability to access your database with administrative access. Most of these accesses are actions performed automatically (e.g. to setup replication or version upgrades), but manual interventions might be required occasionally. All Scaleway accesses are authenticated and traced following industry security standards.

## Identity and access management
Managed Databases for PostgreSQL provides [IAM permissions sets](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/) (**RelationalDatabasesReadOnly** and **RelationalDatabasesFullAccess**) which allow or restrict specific actions a user or application can perform, such as creating or deleting Database Instances.
You remain responsible for giving these permissions to the relevant users or applications and reviewing these accesses frequently.

Managed Databases for PostgreSQL lets you manage access to user accounts inside your database. These typically correspond to PostgreSQL or MySQL users inside your Database Instance who can connect to your database and perform SQL queries. To ensure your Database Instance security and reliability, we limit the set of SQL actions you can perform or give to other users, such as `CREATE PUBLICATION` or `CREATE USER user SUPERUSER` in PostgreSQL.
However, you still remain responsible for giving access to the relevant users or applications and reviewing these accesses frequently. Moreover, these accesses are stored inside your Database Instance only (and independent from Scaleway IAM), which means you are responsible for ensuring they are properly backed up or removed when required.
(Question: Do Backups use pg_dumpall and also store this data?)

## Security best practices
For optimal security, we recommend that you:
- Activate connection encryption and certificate validation in clients connecting to the database (ssl-mode `verify-full` option in PostgreSQL clients, or `VERIFY_IDENTITY` option in MySQL clients)
- Restrict external access to databases by limiting IPs able to connect to database (using for instance ACLs)
