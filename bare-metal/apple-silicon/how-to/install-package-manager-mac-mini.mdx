[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager for macOS. It allows you to manage the packages installed on your Mac mini and provides a way to install additional software on your machine.

1. Install Homebrew by running the following command:
    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```
2. Update Homebrew by running the following command:
    ```bash
    brew update
    ```
3. Retrieve the list of all the outdated packages on your system:
    ```bash
    brew outdated
    ```
4. Upgrade these packages to the latest version available in Homebrew's repositories:
    ```bash
    brew upgrade
    ```

      If you want to upgrade selected packages only, run the following command: `brew upgrade package-name`.
