Read our [dedicated documentation](/key-manager/reference-content/understanding-key-manager/#management-methods-you-can-use-with-key-manager) to find out about the management methods Key Manager provides.

## Which cryptographic operations does Key Manager support?

Key Manager supports the three following cryptographic operations:

- [Encryption](/key-manager/concepts/#encryption)
- [Decryption](/key-manager/concepts/#decryption)
- [Data encryption key](/key-manager/concepts/#data-encryption-key-dek) generation

## Which algorithms and key usage does Key Manager support?

Refer to our [dedicated documentation](/key-manager/reference-content/understanding-key-manager/) to find out more about Key Manager.

## What happens when I delete a key?

When you delete a key, it is scheduled for deletion. This lets you mark a key and its version for deletion ahead of time. Instead of immediate deletion, the key enters a 7-day pending deletion period, during which you can still recover it.

During this time, you can read your key version but cannot edit, access, or delete it. After the retention period, the key and its version are permanently deleted.

Recovering keys [scheduled for deletion](/key-manager/concepts/#scheduled-deletion) is billed â‚¬0.01 per key.
