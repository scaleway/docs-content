## Allowed IPs

Access Control List (ACL) rules [define permissions for remote access to an Instance](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/manage-allowed-ip-addresses/). A rule consists of an IP address or an IP range. You can use them to define which host and networks can connect to your Database Instance's endpoint. You can add, edit or delete rules from your ACLs. The initial setup of a Database Instance allows full network access from anywhere (`0.0.0.0/0`).

Access control is handled directly at network-level by Load Balancers, making the filtering more efficient, universal and relieving the Database Instance from this task.

## Advanced settings

Database Instances have settings that allow you to tune the behavior of their database engine to better fit your needs. Available settings depend on the database engine and its version. Each Database Instance setting entry has a default value that the user can override. The deletion of a setting entry restores the setting to the entry's default value. Some of the default values can be different from the engine's default, as their configuration is optimized to work at full potential with the Scaleway ecosystem.

## Clone feature

Allows you to create a full copy of your Database Instance (including users and permissions) at a point in time. This new Instance is fully independent of its parent.

## Database backup

A database backup is a complete dated export of a logical database stored on a backup backend. You can use the [Managed Databases API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/managed-database-postgre-mysql/#path-backups-create-a-database-backup) to define if the backup should be stored on a region different from the database.

## Database snapshot

A [Snapshot](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/manage-snapshots/) is a consistent, instantaneous copy of the Block Storage volume of your Database Instance at a certain point in time. They are designed to recover your data in case of failure or accidental alterations of the data by a user. They allow you to quickly create a new Instance from a previous state of your database, regardless of the size of the volume. Their limitation is that unlike Backups, Snapshots can only be stored in the same location as the original data.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Endpoint

A point of connection to a database. The endpoint is associated with an IPv4 address and a port, and contains the information of whether the endpoint is read-write or not.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Engine

A database engine is the software component that stores and retrieves your data from a database. Currently, PostgreSQL version 9.6, 10, 11, 12 and 13 are available. MySQL is available in version 8.

</Concept>

## High availability

Is a Database Instance configuration that allows you to create a standby node, with an up-to-date replica of the database. If the main node fails for any reason, the standby can take over requests, reducing downtime.

The HA standby node is linked to the main node, using synchronous replication. Synchronous replication offers the ability to confirm that all changes intended by a transaction have been transferred and applied to the synchronous replica node, providing durability to the data.

<Message type="important">
  You can upgrade a standalone node to High Availability after Database Instance creation, but not the opposite.
</Message>

<Message type="note">
  HA standby nodes are not accessible to users unless the main node becomes unavailable and the standby takes over. If you wish to run queries on a read-only node, you can use [Read Replicas](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/create-read-replica).
</Message>

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Database Instance

A Database Instance is made up of multiple (at least 1) dedicated compute nodes, and is running a single Database Engine. Exactly one database engine is running on each node.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Logs

Logs can contain useful information for debugging or to know more about the behavior and activity of your databases.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Managed Database

Compared to traditional database management, which requires customers to provision their infrastructure and resources to manage their databases, managed databases offer the user access to a Database Instance without setting up the hardware or configuring the software.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Read Replica

A Read Replica is a live copy of a Database Instance that behaves like an Instance, but that only allows read-only connections. The replica mirrors the data of the primary Database node and any changes made are synchronized and reflected in the replica.

</Concept>

## Region and Availability Zone

## Relational database

A database type that uses the relational model, which means that it stores and provides access to inter-related data points within the same database. Relational databases provide an intuitive, straightforward way of representing data in tables.
