Scaleway [Block Storage](/storage/block/concepts/#block-device) provides network-attached storage that can be plugged in and out of cloud products such as [Instances](/compute/instances/concepts/#instance) like a virtual hard-drive. Block Storage devices are independent of the local storage of Instances, and the fact that they are accessed over a network connection makes it easy to move them between Instances in the same [Availability Zone](/compute/instances/concepts/#availability-zone). 
From the user's point of view, once [mounted](/storage/block/api-cli/managing-a-volume/#mounting-and-using-a-volume), the block device behaves like a regular disk.

## How to create a Block Storage volume

1. Click **Block Storage** in the **Storage** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Block Storage page displays.
2. Click **+Create volume**.
3. Follow the steps in the creation wizard:
    - Choose an [Availability Zone](/compute/instances/concepts/#availability-zone).
    - Configure the volume:
        - Enter a name for your volume or leave the automatically-generated name.
        - Select an [IOPS](/storage/block/concepts/#iops).
        <Message type="important">
          You cannot edit the IOPS after you create your volume.
        </Message>

        - Define a volume size.
        <Message type="important">
          The volume size must be of at least 5GB.
        </Message>
    - Select an Instance from the drop-down to attach your volume. This step is optional.
    - Check the estimated cost.
4. Click **Create volume**. The volumes overview page displays.
    <Message type="important">
      The volume must be in the same Availability Zone as the Instance you want to connect it to.

## How to attach a Block Storage volume to an Instance

1. Click **Block Storage** in the **Storage** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. Your volumes display.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Attach to Instance** next to the volume of your choice. A pop-up displays.
3. Select the Instance to which you want to attach your volume from the drop-down.
4. Click **Attach volume to Instance**.

## How to mount and use a Block Storage volume

In order to mount and use your Block Storage volume, you need to connect to the Instance it is attached to via SSH.
Then, check that the volume is available, format it and mount it, following the instructions below.

### How to verify device availability

1. Open a terminal and connect to your Instance with `ssh`. Make sure you replace `<your_instance_ip>` with your Instance's public IP.
    ```
    ssh root@<your_instance_ip>
    ```
2. Use the `lsblk` command to make sure your block volume is available.

   You should see an output like the following. You can see your block volume named `sda` with the chosen storage size.

   ```sh no-copy
   root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# lsblk
    NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    sda       8:0    0 23.3G  0 disk
    vda     252:0    0 18.6G  0 disk
    ├─vda1  252:1    0 18.5G  0 part /
    └─vda15 252:15   0  100M  0 part /boot/efi
   ```

    <Message type="note">
      The Scaleway ecosystem uses [GB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte) to define storage sizes and not [GiB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibibyte) as default on Linux.

### How to format the Block Storage volume

1. Create a file system with the following command. This command uses the `ext4` filesystem, though you can choose another if you prefer.
    ```
    mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda
    ```
2. Run the `lsblk -f` command to make sure your file system was correctly created.

  You should see an output like the following. Check that the `FSTYPE` field matches `ext4` for your Block volume.

  ```sh no-copy
  root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# lsblk -f
  NAME    FSTYPE LABEL UUID                                 MOUNTPOINT
  sda     ext4         925c2c17-ca8c-493a-a9cd-b475d87fd276
  vda
  ├─vda1  ext4   root  8509fe04-d91c-410a-9087-c5d34537d3ae /
  └─vda15 vfat         B3E7-7040                            /boot/efi
  ```

Check that the `FSTYPE` field matches `ext4` for your volume.

### How to mount the Block Storage volume

Once you have created your file system, you need to mount it.

1. Create the mount point. In this tutorial, we choose `/mnt/block-volume`.
    ```
    mkdir /mnt/block-volume
    ```
2. Mount the volume. We recommend that you use the `defaults` option, as in the command below.
    ```
    mount -o defaults /dev/sda /mnt/block-volume
    ```

    ```sh no-copy
        **defaults**
              Use  the  default  options: **rw**, **suid**, **dev**,
              **exec**, **auto**, **nouser**, and **async**.
    ```

    If you want to see all available options, you can run `man mount` on your Instance.

    ```
    root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# mount -o defaults /dev/sda /mnt/block-volume
    ```
3. Run the `lsblk` command to make sure your file system is properly mounted.

    You should see an output like the following. Check the `MOUNTPOINT` field.

    ```sh no-copy
    root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# lsblk
    NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    sda       8:0    0 23.3G  0 disk /mnt/block-volume
    vda     252:0    0 18.6G  0 disk
    ├─vda1  252:1    0 18.5G  0 part /
    └─vda15 252:15   0  100M  0 part /boot/efi
    ```

### How to use fstab for Persistent Mounting

With the current configuration, the block device will not be mounted automatically upon reboot. Use the `fstab` file to make sure the reboot does not impact your file system.

Add this line to the `/etc/fstab` file of your Instance:

```
echo "UUID=$(blkid --output value /dev/sda | head -n1) /mnt/block-volume ext4 defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
```

You can now use your Block Storage volume like a regular disk of your Instance, and store data on it as you wish.
