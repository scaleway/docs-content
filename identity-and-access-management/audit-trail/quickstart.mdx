In this quickstart, we show you how to start using [Audit Trail](/identity-and-access-management/audit-trail/concepts/#audit-trail).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created resources integrated with Audit Trail

## How to configure the Audit Trail permission set

To start using Audit Trail you need to configure the `AuditTrailReadOnly` permission set in [IAM](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#iam). The [scope](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#scope) of this permission set is at [Organization](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#organization) level.

1. Click **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** from the top-right of your [**Organization Dashboard**](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) in the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) displays.
2. [Create an IAM policy](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-policy/) and perform steps one to five.
3. Select the **Access to Organization features** scope and click **Validate** to move on to the next step.
    <Message type="important">
     The **Access to Organization features** scope allows you to give the [principal](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#principal) permissions to Organization-level features such as IAM, Audit Trail, billing, support & abuse tickets, and project management.

4. Click the **Security and Identity** category in the **Products** section, then choose the **AuditTrailReadOnly** permission set.
5. Click **Validate**.
6. Click **Create policy**.

You now have access to Audit Trail.

## How to use Audit Trail

1. Click **Audit Trail** in the **Security and Identity** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu.
2. Click the **Region** dop-down and select a region in which you have created resources integrated with Audit Trail. Your Audit Trail events should display.
3. Click the **Date range** field and select a date range to track events for.
4. Click the **Project** drop-down and select the Scaleway Project containing the resources you want to track.
5. Click the **Method** drop-down and select the API method you want to track events for.
6. Click the **Status** drop-down and select either **Successful** or **Failed**.
7. Optionally, click **Reset** to reset the filter.

    <Message type="tip">
     If no events display after you use the filter, try switching the region from the **Region** drop-down, or adjusting your search.
