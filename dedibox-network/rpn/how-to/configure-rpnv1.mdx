## How to configure RPNv1 from the Scaleway console

1. Click **RPN** > **RPN groups** in the navigation bar on top of your console to enter the [RPN groups configuration](http://console.online.net/en/server/rpn) page.

2. Click **Create group** to create a new RPN group. The group creation interface displays.

3. Enter a name for your RPN group and select the Dedibox servers you want to add to the group. Then save. 

    <Message type="tip">

    It takes about five to ten minutes to activate a new RPNv1 group. Once the group is active, its status changes to **active**.
