This page provides information about Scaleway's Domains and DNS service.

## Domain and zone

A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet. Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS). Any name registered in the DNS is a domain name.

Domains are further divided into sub-domains, that become DNS zones with their own set of administrators and DNS servers.

The term domain is used in the business functions of the entity assigned to it and the term zone is usually used for configuration of DNS services.

## Example

`domain_example.com` is the `domain` and has only one owner who can manage it.

By default, the domain only has a root zone and no subdomains.

The `zone` for `example.com` allows you to configure records such as:

```bash
example.com
├── (root)
    ├── www           # www.example.com
    ├── mail          # mail.example.com
    └── www.dev       # www.dev.example.com
```

If we add a DNS zone to the subdomain `dev.example.com`, we get:

```bash
example.com
├── (root)
│   ├── www           # www.example.com
│   └── mail          # mail.example.com
│
├── dev
    └── www           # www.dev.example.com
```

</Concept>

## Advantages of subdomains and multiple zones

Multiple zones (i.e. subdomains) allow:

- access delegation to zone(s) (preventing access to the root zone)
- access (future) to features based on `templates`
- performance tuning. For example if you have 10 000 records, we recommend that you divide them into x zones or subdomains.

  - To be RFC compliant, each zone will automatically have name server records added.

## Internationalized domain name

An internationalized domain name (IDN) is an Internet domain name that contains at least one label that is displayed in software applications, which is in whole or in part in a language-specific script or alphabet, such as Arabic, Chinese, Cyrillic, Tamil, Hebrew or the Latin alphabet-based characters with diacritics or ligatures, such as French. These writing systems are encoded by computers in multi-byte Unicode. Internationalized domain names are stored in the Domain Name System as ASCII strings using Punycode transcription.

Example: `allélua.com` converted in IDN is `xn--alllua-dva.com`.

To simplify its use, the Domains and DNS API uses `unicode` (`UTF-8`) for name and data fields.
