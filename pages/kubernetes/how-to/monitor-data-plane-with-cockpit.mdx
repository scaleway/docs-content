You can now send **data plane** logs from your [Kapsule or Kosmos](https://www.scaleway.com/en/kubernetes) clusters to [Cockpit](https://www.scaleway.com/en/cockpit/), providing centralized, real-time access to application and system logs. Reduce complexity and manual work thanks to this integration, powered by a **Promtail** deployment via [Easy Deploy](/kubernetes/how-to/enable-easy-deploy/).

This feature allows you to:

- **Enhance observability**: View logs from all your Kubernetes containers in one place.
- **Simplify troubleshooting**: Quickly drill down into specific pods or containers without needing to configure a separate logging stack.

<Message type="important">
    This feature does incur costs based on the volume of logs ingested. Refer to [Cockpit FAQ](/faq/cockpit/#how-am-i-billed-for-using-cockpit-with-custom-data) for more details and best practices to avoid unexpected bills.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A running [Kapsule](/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/) or [Kosmos](/kubernetes/how-to/create-kosmos-cluster/) cluster.
- An API Key with [IAM permissions](/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/) to:
  - edit your cluster `(KubernetesFullAccess` or `KubernetesSystemMastersGroupAccess`)
  - write on Cockpit (`ObservabilityFullAccess`)
- [A token](/cockpit/how-to/create-token/) with permissions to push to, and query logs from Cockpit

## Architecture and limitations

### Control plane vs. data plane

- **Control plane**: Fully managed by Scaleway. Users can already [monitor control plane components](/kubernetes/how-to/monitor-cluster/) (e.g., `kube-apiserver`, `CCM`, `CSI`) via Cockpit.  
- **Data plane**: Runs in your Scaleway Project (customer-managed instances, `kubelet`, `containerd`, customer Pods, etc.). You have **full access** to the data plane, including the ability to SSH into nodes.

| Components         | `kube-apiserver`, `CCM`, `CSI`, etc.                                                                                                                     | `kubelet`, `containerd`, customer Pods, and system components like `kubelet.service`.                             |

Because the data plane is entirely under your control, **logs from any components running on these nodes are considered your own data**. Consequently, shipping these logs to Cockpit is billed based on data ingestion.

## How it works

The system leverages **Promtail** (a lightweight log collector) running on your Kapsule or Kosmos cluster. Promtail forwards logs to the Loki endpoint of your Cockpit instance:

1. **Promtail** can collect logs from:
   - **Container stdout/stderr** (pods)
   - **systemd journal** (e.g., `kubelet.service`)
2. The app automatically creates a custom datasource called `kubernetes-logs` and a Cockpit token with push logs permission.
3. **Log data** is transmitted to **Cockpit** (Loki).
4. **Cockpit** stores and indexes these logs.

## Step-by-step: Enabling container logs in Cockpit

You can use Scalewayâ€™s **[Easy Deploy](/kubernetes/how-to/enable-easy-deploy/)** to add a Promtail deployment to your cluster:

1. Log in to the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) and go to your **Kubernetes** cluster.
2. Navigate to the **Easy Deploy** tab.
3. Select **Promtail for Cockpit** from the library.
4. **Deploy** the application. Promtail will install on your cluster with default settings that:
   - Collect container logs for **all namespaces** (by default).
   - Collect systemd journal logs (e.g., `kubelet.service`).
   - Forward logs securely to **Cockpit**.
    <Message type="note">
      You can edit the default deployment configuration to filter logs by source (under `config.snippets.scrapeConfigs` in the YAML file). For example:
      ```yaml
      cockpit_promtail_scrape_config_pods: "namespace1,namespace2"
      cockpit_promtail_scrape_config_journal: "kubelet.service,kube-proxy.service"
      ```
    </Message>

### Example Promtail configuration
Below is a simplified snippet of the configuration that Easy Deploy generates by default:
```yaml
config:
  clients:
    - bearer_token: "{{{ cockpit_bearer_token }}}" # Automatically set by Easy Deploy
      url: "{{{ cockpit_loki_push_url }}}" # Automatically set by Easy Deploy

  snippets:
    scrapeConfigs: |
      {{{- cockpit_promtail_scrape_config_pods }}} # Default: log all pods
      {{{- cockpit_promtail_scrape_config_journal }}} # Default: log all system components
extraVolumeMounts:
  - mountPath: /var/log/journal
    name: journal
    readOnly: true
extraVolumes:
  - hostPath:
      path: /var/log/journal
    name: journal
```
<Message type="note">
  Template values like `{{{ cockpit_bearer_token }}}` (Bearer Token) and `{{{ cockpit_loki_push_url }}}` (Loki URL) are automatically set. Avoid modifying these values.

## Visualizing logs in Cockpit

Once Promtail is running:

1. Go to the **Cockpit** section of the Scaleway console, then click **Open dashboards**.
2. Log into Grafana using your [Cockpit credentials](/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/).
3. In Grafana's menu, go to dashboards and select **Kubernetes Cluster Pod Log**.
4. **Filter** by:
   - `Datasource` which is automatically created upon deployment, and visible in the Cockpit console
   - `Cluster Name` ( e.g. `my-kapsule-cluster`)
   - `namespace`, `pod`, or `container` labels to isolate specific workloads
   - **Time range** to limit how far back in history you want to query
5. **Analyze** logs in real-time or historical mode to troubleshoot issues, watch for errors, or track performance.

## Usage and pricing

Sending logs to Cockpit is billed based on the **total volume of logs ingested**. Learn more about how you are billed for using Cockpit with Scaleway data [in the Cockpit FAQ](/faq/cockpit/#how-am-i-billed-for-using-cockpit-with-my-scaleway-data).

Key points include:

- **Logging rate**: The more logs you produce (e.g. high-traffic workloads or verbose logging), the higher the bill.
- **Filtering**: Limit logs to critical namespaces or system components only.

<Message type="note">
  You may edit the default configuration of the deployment to adjust the volume of logs to ingest:
  ```yaml
  extraLimitsConfig: |
    readline_rate_enabled: true # rate limiting
    readline_rate: 10000 # log lines / sec
    readline_burst: 10000 # cap for burst lines
    readline_rate_drop: true # drop excess lines
  ```

<Message type="tip">
  Always monitor the logs ingestion rate in the dedicated dashboards provided in Cockpit to avoid surprises.
</Message>

## Security considerations

- **Authentication**: The Promtail client uses a Cockpit Bearer Token to authenticate. Keep this token secret; do not store it in publicly accessible repos.
- **Encryption**: Communication between Promtail and Cockpit (HTTPS) encrypts logs in transit.
- **Access Control**: Ensure only trusted team members can deploy Easy Deploy applications or modify cluster-level configurations.

## Troubleshooting

- **No logs appearing** in Cockpit:
  - Verify that the Promtail pod is running.
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n <promtail-namespace>
    ```
  - Inspect Promtail logs for errors.
    ```bash
    kubectl logs <promtail-pod-name> -n <promtail-namespace>
    ```

- **High log ingestion cost**:
  - Review your **deployment configuration** to filter out verbose logs or unneeded namespaces.
  - Check **log ingestion rate** in the dedicated dashboards for unusual spikes.
