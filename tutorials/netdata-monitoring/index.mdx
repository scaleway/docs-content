[Netdata](https://www.netdata.cloud/) is a system monitoring system, designed to be distributed, lightweight, flexible and open source. The source code is available for download from [GitHub](https://github.com/netdata/netdata).

The application can detect hundreds of metrics automatically, simplifying their configuration and integration. The application's core is written in C and hundreds of collectors are available to collect thousands of different metrics while being very lightweight and not requiring additional computing power. Netdata can either run autonomously, without any third-party components, or it can be integrated to existing monitoring toolchains like [Prometheus](/tutorials/prometheus-monitoring-grafana-dashboard), Graphite, OpenTSDB, [Kafka](/tutorials/configure-apache-kafka/), [Grafana](/tutorials/monitor-k8s-grafana), and more.

## Installing Netdata

1. [Connect to your instance](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/) via SSH.
2. Update the repository lists of the `apt` package manager and use the `upgrade` command to upgrade the software already installed on the Instance:
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
3. Run the automatic installer of Netdata:
    ```
    bash <(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart.sh)
    ```

    The automatic installer will run some tests to the detect the operating system version and install additional dependencies using the `apt` package manager. During the automatic installation, you will be asked to confirm the installation of additional packages using `apt` several times. When prompted, press `Enter` or `Y` to validate.

    ```
    Successfully installed the Netdata Agent.

    Official documentation can be found online at https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/.

    Looking to monitor all of your infrastructure with Netdata? Check out Netdata Cloud at https://app.netdata.cloud.

    Optionally, Netdata sends by default anonymous [usage statistics](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/anonymous-statistics.md) to Google Analytics to identify how the product is used and also for quality assusrance statistics.  

    It is possible to opt-out from these statistics using an empty file called `.opt-out-from-anonymous-statistics` which stored in the Netdata configuration directory. It stops the statistics script from running. 
4. Create the file using the `touch` command:
    ```
    touch /etc/netdata/.opt-out-from-anonymous-statistics
    ```

## Logging into Netdata

1. Open a web browser on your local computer, for example Chrome or Firefox.
2. Point it to `http://<netdata_instance_ip>:19999/` (replace `<netdata_instance_ip>` with the public IP address of your instance.)
3. The Netdata dashboard displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-netdata-dashboard.webp" alt="" />

By default Netdata monitors a wide list of services on the machine. Browse around to see the details of all of them.

## Adding multiple nodes into Netdata

Netdata is a distributed application, and it is possible to add multiple nodes to a single account.

1. From the Netdata dashboard, click **Sign in**.
2. The Netdata Cloud splash screen displays. Enter your email address to generate a magic link. Alternatively, use a [Google](https://account.google.com/) or [GitHub](https://www.github.com/) account to authenticate.
3. Click the magic link, sent to the email address entered in the previous step.2. The Netdata Cloud splash screen displays. Enter your email address to generate a magic link. Alternatively, use a [Google](https://account.google.com/) or [GitHub](https://www.github.com/) account to authenticate.

## Configuring additional metrics

Netdata comes by default with a broad range of internal plugins to [gather system statistics](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/). To collect non-system metrics, Netdata supports many data collection plugins for various software, like web servers, load balancers, mail servers and more. While **internal** plugins are written in the `C` programming language and run as threads inside the `netdata` daemon, **external** plugins may be written in any programming language and are spawned as independent long-running processes by the `netdata` daemon and communicate with the `netdata` daemon via `pipes` (`stdout` communication).

To facilitate the plugin development and to limit the number of threads and processes, Netdata supports plugin orchestrators. Currently there are orchestrators available for four different programming languages: `C`, `python`, `node.js` and `bash`.

In the following example, a plugin to monitor a [NGINX](https://www.nginx.org) web server using Netdata is being configured.

The plugin relies on data provided by the Nginx module [`stub_status`](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_stub_status_module.html). 

1. Add the following configuration in a Nginx [server block](/tutorials/installation-lemp-ubuntu-bionic#configuring-a-nginx-server-block):
    ```
    location /stub_status {
      stub_status;
      # for security reasons: only allow access from the localhost.
      allow 127.0.0.1;
      # deny anyone else
      deny all;
    }
    ```
2. Edit the Nginx plugin configuration file (`go.d/nginx.conf`) using `edit-config` from the Netdata config directory:
    ```
    cd /etc/netdata # Replace this path with your Netdata config directory
    ./edit-config go.d/nginx.conf
    ```
3. Configure the URL to the server's `stub_status`:
    ```
    jobs:
      - name: local
        url: http://127.0.0.1/stub_status
    ```
    <Message type="tip">
      It is also possible to monitor remote servers by adding them as follows to the configuration file: 
      ```
      jobs:
        - name: remote
          url: http://51.15.115.34/stub_status
      ```
    </Message>
4. Restart the Netdata service:
    ```
    service netdata restart
    ```
5. Point your web browser to the Netata interface and click **nginx local** in the menu on the right. The Nginx statistics displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-nginx-stats.webp" alt="" />

For more information regarding all available plugins, refer to the official [Netdata documentation](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/agent/collectors/).

<Message type="note">
  For security reasons, it is recommended to setup a [Nginx reverse proxy](/tutorials/nginx-reverse-proxy) and to block access to the application from the Internet using a [firewall](/tutorials/installation-uncomplicated-firewall).
