# Overview of the v1 API evolution

The transition from `v1beta1` to `v1` for Scaleway Serverless Containers introduces significant improvements in security, resource management, and flexibility.
While the transition is designed to be as smooth as possible, users of the API, CLI, and Terraform should note several key updates to field names and behaviors.

Scope of this document is only for Serverless Containers. Serverless Functions and Serverless Jobs API remains the same.

## Key improvements

### Advanced Triggers and Cron management

Triggers have been redesigned to offer more granular control over how your containers are invoked.

* **Unified CRONs:** CRONs are now managed as a specific type of trigger. This simplifies resource management by using the /triggers route for all event sources.
* **Custom HTTP paths and headers:** You can now specify a custom HTTP path (ex: `/my-trigger`) and custom headers for any trigger, providing better integration with your application logic.
* **Self-managed credentials:** For SQS and NATS triggers, you now provide your own IAM credentials. This improvement prevents accidental trigger failures caused by deleted system-generated credentials and enables more freedom on setups (triggering a Scaleway container from SQS queue hosted on your Instance).

### Automatic Deployment

In the `v1` API, the `deploy = true` flag is no longer required. Any call to `CreateContainer` or an update will now automatically deploy the container immediately. This aligns Serverless Containers with the standard behavior of all other Scaleway products.

### Auth with IAM

JWT auth is being gradually deprecated in favor of IAM tokens. The deprecation will be effective once IAM tokens can provide the same granularity of JWT. [Read more](/serverless-functions/how-to/migrate-jwt-to-iam-authentication/).

### Container Registry namespaces

Creating a Serverless Containers namespace no longer creates a `funcscw` Container Registry namespace automatically.

This change allows for greater control over the organization of Container Registry namespaces, and avoids quota errors when creating Container Namespaces.

### Health Checks

In addition to health checks, we have introduced Startup Probes. This allows advanced users to define a specific check that runs only during the initial boot of the container, preventing the system from prematurely restarting slow-starting applications.

## Breaking changes

**Attention required:** Breaking change. If you call Scaleway Serverless Containers API directly via HTTP calls, you need to be careful about the following modifications.

When using the product via higher level clients like [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com/), [CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli), [SDK](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/scaleway-sdk/),
[Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/scaleway/scaleway/latest/docs) the impacts will be minor.
