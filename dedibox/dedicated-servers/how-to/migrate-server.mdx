All physical servers eventually reach their End of Life (EOL), but this process is manageable and does not have to disrupt your operations.
Hardware vendors provide a warranty and replacement parts for a limited time, usually a few years.
If your Dedibox server approaches EOL, you will see a warning in the console. 
Rest assured, this guide will walk you through the steps to seamlessly migrate your services and data to a new server, ensuring continuity and minimal downtime.

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- A [created](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/order-a-server/) and [installed](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/install-a-server/) dedicated server

## How to migrate your data

Transferring data from one server to another is straightforward. Here are some methods you can use:

- [Use FTP](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/connect-to-server/#via-sftp)
- [Use SCP](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/connect-to-server/#via-scp)

### Migrating to the same OS version

If you are migrating to the same OS version on your new server, you can copy the old server's configuration files to the new one. Most configuration files are located under `/etc/`, so it's a good idea to back up this entire directory.

Some configuration files, such as those for IP addresses and MAC addresses, may need to be adapted for your new machine. For example, you might need to modify:

- `/etc/network/interfaces`
- `/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules`

### Migrating to a different OS version

When migrating to a newer version of your OS, you will usually need to reconfigure your services. We do not recommend copying your old configuration files to your new server in this case.

This version improves readability and ensures all necessary steps and information are clearly communicated.
