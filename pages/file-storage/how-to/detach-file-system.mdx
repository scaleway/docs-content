## How to detach a file system from an instance

1. Click **File Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. A list of your file systems displays.

2. Click the name of the file system you want to detach. The **Overview** page displays.

3. Open the **Attached Instances** tab. A list of Instances attached to the selected file system displays.

4. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the Instance you want to detach, then click **Detach** from the drop-down menu. A confirmation pop-up appears.
 
5. Click **Detach Instance** to confirm your action.

Your Instance is now detached, and no longer appears in the list.
