You can disable the multifactor authentication of your Dedibox account if you want to register a new authentication device.

<Message type="important">
For security reasons, it is **not recommended to disable** multifactor authentication permanently.
</Message>

## How to disable multifactor authentication

1. Click your username, next to _logged in as_, in the top right corner of the console. Then click **Security** in the pop-up menu.

2. The security page displays. Click **Disable two factor authenticaton**.
3. Enter a security token generated by your multifactor authentication application and click **Confirm**.

Multifactor authentication is now disabled, and you can log in with your identifier and password only.

## How to restore access to your account

If you lose both your MFA app and backup codes, the only way to regain access to your account is through a manual identity verification. To do so, contact our support team with the following information:
  * Email address,
  * Postal address,
  * Two different documents proving your identity (passport or local ID card, for individual accounts + certificate of incorporation, for companies),
  * Your current phone number,
  * A copy of your last Dedibox bill or, if you do not have it, details about the charged amount,
  * A card statement showing the Scaleway bill debit.

Once you have collected this information, send it to [document@scaleway.com](mailto:document@scaleway.com).
