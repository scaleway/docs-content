Private Networks allow your Data Warehouse for ClickHouse® deployments to communicate in an isolated and secure network without needing to be connected to the public internet. Each deployment can be connected to one Private Network.

For full information about Scaleway Private Networks and VPC, see our [dedicated documentation](/vpc/) and [best practices guide](/vpc/reference-content/getting-most-private-networks/).
