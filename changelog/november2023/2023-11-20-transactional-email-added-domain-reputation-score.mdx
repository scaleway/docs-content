We have recently introduced [domain reputation score](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#reputation-score). Every domain within your Organization has a score, reflecting its overall health. The higher the score, the better the delivery performance for your domain. Refer to our documentation for [guidelines on maintaining a favorable reputation score](/managed-services/transactional-email/reference-content/understanding-tem-reputation-score/).
