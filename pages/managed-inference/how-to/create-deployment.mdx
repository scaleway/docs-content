    - Choose the geographical **region** for the deployment.
    - Specify the GPU Instance type to be used with your deployment.
4. Enter a **name** for the deployment, and optional tags.
5. Configure the **network connectivity** settings for the deployment:
    - Attach to a **Private Network** for secure communication and restricted availability. Choose an existing Private Network from the drop-down list, or create a new one.
    - Set up **Public connectivity** to access resources via the public internet. Authentication by API key is enabled by default.
    <Message type="important">
      - Enabling both private and public connectivity will result in two distinct endpoints (public and private) for your deployment.
      - Deployments must have at least one endpoint, either public or private.
