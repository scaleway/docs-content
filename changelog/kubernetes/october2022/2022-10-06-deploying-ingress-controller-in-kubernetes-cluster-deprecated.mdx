The option to deploy an Ingress Controller in a Kubernetes cluster at cluster creation is no longer possible. Users can still [deploy a pre-configured Ingress Controller](/compute/kubernetes/how-to/deploy-ingress-controller) after cluster creation using the Easy Deploy feature within the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com/).
