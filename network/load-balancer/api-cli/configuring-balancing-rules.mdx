You can configure balancing rules via the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/) by creating a backend. To do so, you need to customize the following parameters:

- `forward_port` — Load Balancer with forward user sessions to this port. For example, you can use port `8080` on a backend, while your front-end port is `80`.
- `forward_port_algorithm` — A string value, specifying one of the following options:
  - `"roundrobin"` — New sessions are balanced equally between the backend servers.
  - `"leastconn"` — This mode will take into account the number of active sessions, established to each of the servers, and will forward new ones to the server, which has the least.
  - `"first"` — The first server with available slots will be chosen.
- `server_ip`- A list of IPv4 or IPv6 address of your servers to redirect the load to.

  ```json
  export $LB_ID="<ID of your Load Balancer>"
  export $TOKEN="<Your secret API key>"

  curl -s -X POST "https://api.scaleway.com/lb/v1/zones/$ZONE/lbs/$LB_ID/backends" -H "accept: application/json" -H "X-Auth-Token: $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"forward_port\":80,\"forward_port_algorithm\":\"roundrobin\",\"forward_protocol\":\"tcp\",\"health_check\":{\"check_delay\":2000,\"check_max_retries\":3,\"check_timeout\":1000,\"port\":80,\"tcp_config\":{}},\"name\":\"main backend\",\"send_proxy_v2\":false,\"server_ip\":[\"<REPLACE-BY-IP-OF-YOUR-SERVER1>\", \"<REPLACE-BY-IP-OF-YOUR-SERVER2>\"]}" | jq .
  ```

Save the ID of the backend for further use.
```json
export $BACKEND_ID="<ID of your backend>"
```

To delete the backend, run the following command:
```json
curl -H "X-Auth-Token: $TOKEN" -X DELETE "https://api.scaleway.com/lb/v1/zones/$ZONE/lbs/$LB_ID/backends/$BACKEND_ID"
```
