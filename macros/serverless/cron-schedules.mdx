macro: cron-schedules
---

Adding a cron schedule to a specific task allows you to run it automatically at fixed times and dates. Cron jobs are specified using a unix-cron format. You can run a task as often as every minute, or as infrequently as once a year.

## Cron schedule format

Cron jobs are expressed using the `* * * * *` format, which corresponds to the fields below.

```
# ┌───────────── minute
# │ ┌───────────── hour 
# │ │ ┌───────────── day of the month 
# │ │ │ ┌───────────── month 
# │ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week
# │ │ │ │ │ 
# │ │ │ │ │
# │ │ │ │ │
# * * * * *
```

Each field supports a specific range of values.


|       Field      |        Values                        |
|:-----------------|:-------------------------------------|
| Minute           | 0-59                                 |
| Hour             | 0-23                                 |
| Day of the month | 1-31                                 |
| Month            | 1-12 (or JAN-DEC)                    |
| Day of the week  | 0-6 (or SUN-SAT, and 7 for Sunday)   |

<Message type="note">
  - The month and the day of the week can be both expressed using numerical or alphabetical values
  - The days of the week `0` and `7` both stand for Sunday
</Message>

## Cron schedule operators

Several operators can be added to each field to further refine your schedule.

| Value | Description                       | Example                                                                    |
|-------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `*`   | Specifies all possible values     | `* * * * *` runs every minute of every hour of every day of every month.   |
| `-`   | Specifies a range of values       | `50-59 * * * *` runs every minute during the last 10 minutes of each hour. |
| `,`   | Specifies a list of values        | `0 9,17 * * *` runs at 9:00 and 17:00 every day.                           |
| `/`   | Specifies the pace to skip values | `0 */2 * */3 *` runs every 2 hours for a day, once every 3 months.         |

## Time zones

- Serverless Functions and Serverless Containers [CRON triggers](/serverless/functions/concepts#cron-trigger) use the **UTC** time zone. This parameter cannot be modified.

- Serverless Jobs allow modifying the time zone of their schedules via the Job **Settings** tab. Refer to [the job scheduling documentation](/serverless/jobs/how-to/manage-job-schedule/) for more information.
