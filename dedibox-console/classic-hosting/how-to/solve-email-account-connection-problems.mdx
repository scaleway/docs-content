    <Message type="note">
      - If you can connect to your email account using the Scaleway webmail, the problem you are experiencing might come from the configuration of your computer.
    </Message>
3. Verify the [configuration of your client](/dedibox-console/classic-hosting/how-to/check-emails).
    <Message type="note">
      - Some email clients cut the domain part of your email address in the username by default. For example, with the email address “[firstname.lastname@example.com](mailto:firstname.lastname@example.com)”, your client cuts it to “firstname.lastname”. Make sure to enter your complete email address as your username.
    </Message>
4. Verify your username and make sure to use your entire email address (for example "[firstname.lastname@example.com](mailto:firstname.lastname@example.com)").
