To update the Operating System installed on your Mac mini M1, you can use the `softwareupdate` tool.

1. Get a list of all available updates by running the following command:
    ```
    softwareupdate --list
    ```
2. Install all available updates by running the following command:
    ```
    sudo softwareupdate --install
    ```

  If you want to upgrade selected packages only, run the following command: `softwareupdate --install package-name`
