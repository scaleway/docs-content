**IQM** is a European leader founded in 2018, specializing in superconducting quantum computers based on transmon technology. These processors are optimized for the general-purpose, universal gate model, making them ideal for the design and execution of standard algorithms, providing high reliability in a low-temperature environment.

## Key features
* **High execution speed:** Superconducting transmon qubits offer nanosecond-scale gate speeds (MHz range), allowing for millions of shots in a short timeframe.
* **Standard gate model:** Follows the universal gate-based paradigm (similar to IBM, Google, Alice and Bob), making it the industry standard for benchmarking and running portable algorithms.
* **Fast reset:** Capable of rapid qubit initialization, which is critical for iterative algorithms requiring frequent re-execution.

## Use cases
* **Variational algorithms (VQE/QAOA):** The high execution speed makes it the best choice for hybrid loops requiring heavy iteration between CPU and QPU (e.g., near-term chemistry or optimization).
* **Financial modeling:** Monte Carlo simulations and risk analysis requiring high-throughput sampling.
* **Benchmarking & education:** Ideal for testing standard quantum algorithms (Shor, Grover) and learning quantum logic on established hardware.

## IQM QPUs available at Scaleway
Three types of IQM QPUs based on transmons, are available at Scaleway:

* **Garnet (20 Qubits):** Ideally suited for benchmarking standard gate-based algorithms and running small-scale variational circuits (VQE, QAOA). It is a robust and stable system, making it the perfect entry point for exploration.
* **Sirius (24 Qubits):** This processor features a unique "star" topology. Currently, **16 qubits are fully operational** and exposed for computation. It is specifically interesting for testing algorithms that benefit from high connectivity centers, differing from standard grids.
* **Emerald (54 Qubits):** IQM's latest generation processor. With **54 qubits**, Emerald crosses a significant threshold, allowing for the execution of circuits that are difficult to simulate classically (depending on depth). It is designed for advanced research, exploring Quantum Advantage, and running deep circuits.

The table below summarizes the key technical specifications and pricing models for each available QPU.
