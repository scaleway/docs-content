You can transfer files from your local machine to your Instance's remote Block volume with [rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync), a tool for efficiently transferring and copying files. The rsync utility is pre-installed on most Linux distributions and macOS.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Instance](/instances/concepts/#instance)
- [Attached](/block-storage/how-to/attach-a-volume/) a Block Storage volume to your Instance
- Installed [Rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/)

1. Check that rsync is installed on your local machine with the following command:
    ```
    rsync --version
    ```

    An output similar to the following displays:

    ```sh no-copy
    rsync  version 3.1.3  protocol version 31
    ```

2. Run the following command to transfer the file to your Instance's mounted block volume. Ensure that you use your own Instance's IP address:

    ```
    rsync -a path/to/file.txt root@<your_instance_ip>:/mnt/block-volume
    ```

3. The file is now transferred. Connect to your Instance again, then run the command below to check that your file is present in your Block Storage volume:

    ```bash
    ls /mnt/block-volume
    ```

Refer to the [official Rsync documentation](https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync.1#OPTION_SUMMARY) for more information on the different options available.
