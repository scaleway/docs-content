Messaging and Queuing (M&Q) proposes a message broker solution, so you can send messages & trigger events between your Cloud resources.

The service supports 3 protocols (NATS, SQS & SNS still in Beta) for you to work with. The service is Serverless-based, so you can run it without taking care of provisioning and will only pay for what you use

M&Q features are available though Console, CLI and Terraform.

Console & API have changed, so existing resources will need to be migrated as communicated to all beta users. Documentation and the team are there to give you the best support.

Find out more in our dedicated M&Q documentation.
