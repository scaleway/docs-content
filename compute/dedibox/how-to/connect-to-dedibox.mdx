## How to connect to your Dedibox

A common way of connecting to your Dedibox server is via the command line, using SSH. SSH is a secure communication protocol, which imposes an encryption key exchange at the beginning of the connection. This means that the exchange of data between the client and the server will be encrypted.

However, you may also connect to your server via a graphical interface such as Windows Remote Desktop.

You can also use FTP, SFTP or SCP to transfer data to and from your server.

## How to connect via SSH 

### From OSX (Mac) and Linux

1. Open a terminal program on your local machine.
2. Enter the command below into the terminal. Make sure you replace `your_private_key` with the filename of your private key (often `id_rsa`) and `your_server_ip` with the IP address of your server.
    ```bash
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_private_key root@your_server_ip
    ```
3. If / when prompted, allow connection to the host by typing `yes`, then press **Enter**.
    ```
    The authenticity of host 'myhost.ext (212.47.226.35)' cannot be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is 4f:ba:65:cf:14:64:a7:1e:b6:07:7c:00:71:95:21:fa.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
    ```

### From Windows

To connect to your server from Windows, you will need to use a small application called **PuTTy**, an SSH client.

To connect to your Instance from Windows, you will need to use a small application called **PuTTy**, an SSH client.

2. Launch PuTTy on your computer. The main screen of the application displays.
3. Enter your Instance's IP address in the **Hostname** field.

      To find the IP address of your Instance, log into the Scaleway console and
      click **Instances** in the Compute section of the side menu. A list of your
      Instances and their associated IP addresses will display.

4. Use the side menu to navigate to the **Auth** sub-category by expanding **Connection**, then **SSH** and finally clicking on **Auth**.
5. Click the **Browse** button and select the private key file you [generated previously](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/).
6. Click **Open** at the bottom of the screen to open a connection to the server. Upon the first connection, PuttY asks you to allow the connection to the host.
7. Click **OK** to confirm. The terminal window displays.
8. Enter your username and password to authenticate against the server with your SSH key.

    You are now connected to your server.

## How to connect via Remote Desktop

The following steps show you how to connect to your Dedibox server on which you have installed Windows Server, from your local Windows machine.

2. Click the drop-down arrow next to **Show connections**.
3. Enter the following information:
    - In **Computer**, enter the IP address of your Dedibox server (e.g. 163.172.20.01).
    - In **Username**, for a Windows Server type **Administrateur**.
4. Click **Connect**. You are prompted to enter a password.
5. Enter the password that you set during installation of your Dedibox Windows Server machine, and click **OK**.
6. You may be asked to confirm that you want to connect. Click **Yes**.

    You are connected to the graphical interface of your Windows Server.
