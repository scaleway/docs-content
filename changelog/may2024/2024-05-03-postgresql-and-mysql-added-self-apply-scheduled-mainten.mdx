Database maintenance operations are set up, run, and scheduled by Scaleway, but you can now select when to apply them to avoid interruptions during peak times.

Refer to [this documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/apply-maintenance/) for more information.
