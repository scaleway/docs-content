## Minecraft - Overview

In 2011 one of the most popular video games was released: [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/).

Developed by the Swedish company [Mojang](https://www.mojang.com/), it has reached over 176 million sales. Today Minecraft counts more than 112 million monthly active players.

As the game is fully customizable, hosting your own Minecraft Instance will provide you with complete freedom to modify the gameplay towards your preferences.

## What is Minecraft?

Minecraft is a video game that allows players to build a 3-dimensional world using various blocks. It is a task that requires creativity from the players who can design and build their virtual world. Users can mine and break down nearly every block in Minecraft by drilling and then collecting them. These broken-down pieces can then be collected and assembled to create new items.
The currently available Java Edition allows players to customize the game with mods towards their preferences, creating new gameplay mechanics, items, textures, and assets.

As there is no specific goal to accomplish, there is no given way how to play Minecraft. Players can achieve anything they want by themselves.

However, some pre-defined game modes are available:

- **Creative Mode**, which allows players to build whatever they can imagine from the limitless resources given to them.
- **Survival Mode**, where players have to gather natural resources such as wood and stone by exploring the world. Players also need to build a house to protect themselves against enemies and source food to survive.

The game supports Multiplayer mode, enabling multiple players to interact and communicate in a single world. Players can either connect to one of the publicly known worlds or build their world with their friends by using a private Minecraft server.

## Why should I run my own Minecraft server?

By setting up your own Minecraft server, you can set the game's rules and invite all of your friends to play with you.
You can install all the mods you want and customize your world with elements that were not initially available when the game was programmed.

The Minecraft server is a Java application and runs perfectly on [Scaleway Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/), allowing you to deploy your own Minecraft Instance in just a few minutes.

## How can I create my own Minecraft server maker?

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have [configured your SSH key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- You have an Instance running on Ubuntu Bionic Beaver (18.04) or later
- You have sudo privileges or access to the root user
- You have a copy of the [Minecraft game client](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/) for your local computer

</Message>

Deploying your own Minecraft server can be done in a few easy steps on a [Scaleway Development Instance](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/development/). In case you do not have an Instance yet, start by [deploying your first Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/).

1. Connect to your Instance using [SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).

2. Update the `apt` packet cache and upgrade the software already installed on the Instance:

  ```
  apt update && apt upgrade -y
  ```

3. Install [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/), an open-source implementation of the Java Platform and the [GNU Screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) package.

  ```
  apt install -y openjdk-8-jre-headless screen
  ```

4. Create a new `minecraft` user under which the Minecraft server application will run:

  ```
  adduser minecraft
  ```

  Enter the user's new password, the password confirmation and the user details when prompted.

5. Switch into the `minecraft` user account:

  ```
  su minecraft
  ```

6. Change into the user's home directory:

  ```
  cd
  ```

7. Download the Minecraft server maker application by using `wget`. The link for the latest version of the application is available directly on the [Minecraft Server website](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server):

  ```
  wget https://launcher.mojang.com/v1/objects/3dc3d84a581f14691199cf6831b71ed1296a9fdf/server.jar
  ```

8. Run the Minecraft server application with the following command:

  ```
  java -Xms1024M -Xmx2048M -jar server.jar nogui
  ```

  <Message type="important">

  The flags `-Xms` and `-Xmx` define the minimum and maximum amount of RAM that can be used by the Minecraft server application. You may adjust these values to your needs. For best performances, it is recommended to leave the minimum value at `1024M`.

  </Message> 

9. During the first run, the application creates a file `eula.txt`. Open the file in a text editor (for example `nano`) and change the value of `eula` from `false` to `true`:

  ```
  nano eula.txt
  ```

  ```
  #By changing the setting below to TRUE you are indicating your agreement to our$
  #Fri Nov 15 14:47:37 GMT 2019
  eula=true
  ```

  Then save the file by pressing on **CTRL+O** and exit nano by pressing **CTRL+X**.

10. Take ownership of the current shell to avoid issues with the `screen` command:

  ```
  script /dev/null
  ```

11. Create a new screen to run the Minecraft application in:

  ```
  screen -S minecraft
  ```

12. Re-run the Minecraft server maker application:

  ```
  java -Xms1024M -Xmx2048M -jar server.jar nogui
  ```

  The following output informs you that the Minecraft server application is running:

  ```
  ...
  [14:53:38] [Server thread/INFO]: Starting minecraft server version 1.14.4

  [14:54:21] [Server thread/INFO]: Done (42.088s)! For help, type "help"
  ```

13. Once the application is running, move the screen in the background by pressing **CTRL+a** followed by **d**. The session is being moved to the background. To resume the running session use the command `screen -r`.

14. You can now log off your Instance and start configuring your Minecraft client.

  <Message type="note">

  The Minecraft server created above uses the standard settings. If you want to create a new world, modify the `level-name` directive in the `server.properties` file as well as other settings accordingly. For more information refer to the [official documentation](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server.properties).
