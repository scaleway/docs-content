This guide provides detailed instructions on how to access your [Mac mini](/apple-silicon/concepts/#mac-mini) using remote desktop clients.

The macOS on your Mac mini uses the VNC protocol with additional Apple-specific enhancements to provide a remote desktop access.
Remote desktop allows you to visualize the graphical screen output of a remote computer and interact with it using your local keyboard and mouse.
The VNC protocol is platform-independent, supporting Linux, Windows, and macOS, ensuring a seamless connection experience regardless of your operating system.

<Message type="important">
  [Enabling FileVault](/apple-silicon/faq/#can-i-enable-filevault-on-a-hosted-mac-mini) on a Mac encrypts the disk, preventing remote connections, such as Remote Desktop or SSH, until the FileVault security key or user password is entered. This requires physical access to the machine, making remote management unavailable until unlocked.

<Requirements />
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- A [Mac mini](/apple-silicon/how-to/create-mac-mini/) running macOS

## Accessing the remote desktop

<Message type="important">
  The VNC port on Mac mini systems is **randomly assigned** during system installation and may therefore be different from the default VNC port 5900. To connect successfully via VNC, use the specific port shown in the **Overview** section of your Mac mini’s configuration.
  For manual connections, ensure that the port from the **Overview** section is correctly entered in your VNC client settings, as this is necessary for a successful connection.

  ## Accessing the remote desktop from a macOS client

  If your local machine runs macOS, you can use the Scaleway console to connect to your Mac mini using the built-in Apple ARD client.

  1. Click **Apple silicon** in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu. A list of your Mac minis displays.
  2. Click the Mac mini you want to connect to. The **Overview** page of your Mac mini displays.
  3. Click **Open remote desktop** in the **Access remote desktop from macOS ①** section to launch Apple's built-in screen sharing client for a seamless remote desktop experience.

    Once your screen displays in your remote desktop client, log in to the graphical environment of macOS using the remote user and your password (available on the **Overview** page of your Mac mini).

  <Message type="note">
    macOS may ask for your password once logged into the remote desktop session. Change the keyboard layout of macOS to your computer's local keyboard layout before entering the password. Click "U.S. keyboard" in the top right corner to display a list of all available keyboard layouts.
  </Message>

  You are now logged in and can use your Mac mini as if you were physically present.

<sup>*</sup> These remote desktop clients do not support audio streaming. If you need audio streaming, we recommend using [Reemo](/tutorials/access-mac-mini-with-reemo/). To configure the connection with Reemo, use a VNC connection. We suggest setting up another VNC connection with this remote desktop client before configuring Reemo.
