## What is Apache Spark?

Apache Spark is an open-source unified analytics engine designed for large-scale data processing. It provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. Spark offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs.

## How does Apache Spark work?

Apache Spark processes data in memory, which allows it to perform tasks up to 100 times faster than traditional disk-based processing frameworks like Hadoop MapReduce. It uses Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) to store data across multiple nodes in a cluster and perform parallel operations on this data.

## How am I billed for Distributed Data Labs?

During the private beta, Scaleway Distributed Data Labs is free.

## Can I use Scaleway Distributed Data Labs for real-time data processing?

Yes, Distributed Data Labs can be used for real-time data processing. Apache Spark has robust support for stream processing through its Spark Streaming and Structured Streaming APIs, which can be utilized within the data lab environment to process real-time data.
