## What are the technical specifications of Serverless SQL Databases?

| Specification   | Minimum | Maximum           |
|-----------------|---------|-------------------|
| vCPU            | 0 vCPU  | 16 vCPU           |
| RAM             | 0 GB    | 64 GB (4 GB/vCPU) |
| Storage\*       | 0 GB    | 1 TB              |
| Connections\*\* | 0       | 28                |

\* The maximum storage capacity will increase with upcoming releases.

\*\* The number of maximum connections scales with the allocated vCPUs an RAM.


## What is autoscaling and how does it work?

Autoscaling triggers automatically based on your database vCPU consumption:

  - **Scaling up**: after using more than a certain percentage of CPU during several minutes, the vCPU and RAM allocated to your database will increase (up to a maximum of 16 vCPUs and 64 GB RAM)

  - **Scaling down**: after consuming less than a certain percentage of CPU during several minutes, the CPU and RAM allocated to your database will decrease (down to a minimum of 1 vCPU and 4 GB RAM while your database is active)

## What is idle state and how does it work?

After receiving no query for 5 minutes, a Serverless SQL Database will enter into idle state. It switches from **Running** to **Ready to use**.

While your database is in idle state, you will not be billed for compute resources (vCPU and RAM). You will however still be billed for storage resources.
