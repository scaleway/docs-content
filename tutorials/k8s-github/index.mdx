## GitLab Kubernetes Integration - Overview

[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) provides a built-in [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) Integration that allows you to build, test, deploy, and run your app at scale.

In this tutorial you will learn how to use the `gitlab` Kubernetes integration using a [Scaleway Virtual Instance](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/).
The instance will be deployed using the Scaleway `gitlab` InstantApp.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have [created an Instance running the `gitlab` InstantApp](/tutorials/gitlab-instant-app).
- You have [created a Kapsule cluster](/compute/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/).
- You have downloaded the corresponding [kubeconfig](/compute/kubernetes/how-to/edit-cluster/) file and [kubectl](/compute/kubernetes/how-to/connect-cluster-kubectl/) is working
- You have the [Helm client](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) installed

## Configuring GitLab Runner using Helm Charts

### Installing helm

In this tutorial we use `helm` to deploy a `gitlab` runner on a `Kapsule` cluster.
If you do not know how to install `helm`, please follow the [tutorial](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) on the official `helm` website.  
On the example below we have successfully installed `helm` version 3.2.0

```
$ helm version
version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.2.0", GitCommit:"e11b7ce3b12db2941e90399e874513fbd24bcb71", GitTreeState:"clean", GoVersion:"go1.13.10"}
```

The `helm` charts are provided through repositories. By default `helm` 3 does not have any repository configured.
We will add the `gitlab` repository, as it provides the necessary chart to install the runner.

```
$ helm repo add gitlab https://charts.gitlab.io
"gitlab" has been added to your repositories
$ helm repo update
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Successfully got an update from the "gitlab" chart repository
Update Complete. ⎈ Happy Helming!⎈
```

### Installing Gitlab Running using Helm

A `helm` chart is always shipped with a `value.yaml` file. It can be edited to customize the deployement of the application.
In this part of the tutorial we customize the `value.yaml` to fit our needs and deploy the runner on `kapsule`.

1. Get the value.yaml :

  ```
  $ wget https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab-runner/-/raw/master/values.yaml
  ```

  Each `gitlab` runner needs a registration token to register on the `gitlab` server.
  Retrieve the registration token from the GitLab web interface ("Admin Area" > "Runners"):

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-token.png" alt="" />

2. Fill the `value.yaml` with :

    - the gitlabUrl (in our case `http://212.47.237.92/`)
    - the registration token
    - enable `rbac`

  <Message type="note"> 
  
  By default, the gitlabUrl and the registration token lines are written out as a comment in the `values.yaml`file. Make sure you have deleted the `#` before saving.

  </Message>

  ```yaml
  [..]
  gitlabUrl: http://212.47.237.92/
  runnerRegistrationToken: "t7u_qjh3EFJX2-yPypkz"
  rbac:
    create: true
    [..]
    serviceAccountName: default
  ```

  We will use a dedicated [namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/).

3. To install the `gitlab` runner, create it on your `Kapsule` cluster:

  ```
  $ kubectl create ns gitlab-runner
  namespace/gitlab-runner created
  ```

  The default service account should use a new kubernetes [role](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#role-example), and [rolebinding](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#rolebinding-example).

4. Use the following example to create a role and role binding and associate it to the default service account in the `gitlab-runner` namespace :

  ```
  $ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
  apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
  kind: Role
  metadata:
    name: gitlab-runner
    namespace: gitlab-runner
  rules:
    - apiGroups: [""]
      resources: ["pods"]
      verbs: ["list", "get", "watch", "create", "delete"]
    - apiGroups: [""]
      resources: ["pods/exec"]
      verbs: ["create"]
    - apiGroups: [""]
      resources: ["pods/log"]
      verbs: ["get"]
  EOF
  $ kubectl create rolebinding --namespace=gitlab-runner gitlab-runner-binding --role=gitlab-runner --serviceaccount=gitlab-runner:default
  ```

5. Use the `helm` command to install the runner (note that you specify in this command line the `values.yaml` file) :

  ```
  $ helm install --namespace gitlab-runner  gitlab-runner -f ./values.yaml gitlab/gitlab-runner
  NAME: gitlab-runner
  LAST DEPLOYED: Wed May  6 15:48:20 2020
  NAMESPACE: gitlab-runner
  STATUS: deployed
  REVISION: 1
  TEST SUITE: None
  NOTES:
  Your GitLab Runner should now be registered against the GitLab instance reachable at: "http://212.47.237.92/"
  ```

  You can check the runner is working ok in the `gitlab` console ("admin area" > runners):

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-runnerok.png" alt="" />

## Running a pipepline in the runner using a test app

To demonstrate if the runner is working, we [create a repository](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/#create-a-repository) with a "hello world" piece of code written in python.

1. Create the files using a text editor of your choice (e.g. `nano` or `vim`). In this tutorial, we use `nano`.

  ```bash
  nano helloworld.py
  ```

2. Create the content of the file as follows, save and exit:

  ```python
  print("Hello, World!")
  ```

3. Create an associated gitlab-ci file to check it is running in the runner we just deployed:

  ```bash
  nano .gitlab-ci.yaml
  ```

4. Create the content of the file as follows, save and exit:

  ```yaml
  image: ubuntu
  hello-test:
    script:
      - apt-get update && apt-get install python3
      - python3 helloworld.py
  ```

5. Push the repository and an ubuntu container is launched. At first `apt` is updated and `python3` is installed, and then the “hello, world” script is launched in the terminal.
