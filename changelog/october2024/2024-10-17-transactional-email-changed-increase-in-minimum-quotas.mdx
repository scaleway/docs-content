We have updated the default email sending quotas to better align with your needs. The new limits are available on the [capabilities and limits](/managed-services/transactional-email/reference-content/tem-capabilities-and-limits/) page. These changes offer greater flexibility and optimization capabilities for managing your email volumes.
