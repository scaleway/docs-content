This page explains how to unmount a file system from one or several Scaleway Instances.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a file system](/file-system/how-to/create-file-system/)
- [Attached](/file-storage/how-to/attach-file-system/) and [mounted](/file-storage/how-to/mount-file-system/) a file system to at least one Scaleway Instance

1. Click **File Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. A list of your file systems displays.

2. Click the name of the file system you want to unmount. The **Overview** page displays.

3. Copy the ID of your file system.

4. Open a terminal and [connect via SSH to the Instances](/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/) you previously [attached to your file system](/file-storage/how-to/attach-file-system/).

5. Run the following command. Make sure to replace the placeholder and mount point with the appropriate values:

    ```sh
    umount /mnt/my_fs
    ```

Your file system is now unmounted from the specified Instance.
