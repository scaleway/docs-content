  1. Choose the **CPU** resources to be allocated to your container at runtime. 

  2. Choose the amount of **memory** to be allocated to your container. Available memory options depend on allocated vCPU, and the maximum ephemeral storage value depends on allocated memory.
  3. Set your [autoscaling](/serverless-containers/concepts/#autoscaling) preferences:
      - **Request concurrency**: your container automatically scales up/down within the minimum and maximum values entered based on the number of concurrent requests received on each active instance of your container.
      - **CPU percentage**: your container automatically scales up/down within the minimum and maximum values entered based on the CPU load.
      - **RAM percentage**: your container automatically scales up/down within the minimum and maximum values entered based on the RAM used.
