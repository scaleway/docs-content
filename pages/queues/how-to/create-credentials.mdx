This page shows how to create [credentials](/queues/concepts/#credentials) for Scaleway Queues. Credentials give their bearer (e.g. services and platforms) access to your messaging queue service. 

You can create multiple sets of credentials for Scaleway Queues. Credentials for Queues are granular: you can define the level of access that they should give. Credentials give the specified level of access to all queues that you create in the [region](/queues/concepts/#region) they are scoped to.
