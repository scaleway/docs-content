The Backup feature is used to back up your Instance data. It creates an image of a snapshot that contains all your volumes.

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have a [Scaleway account](/console/my-account/how-to/create-an-account/)   
  - You have [configured your API keys](/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key/)

</Message>

A backup is created using the command:
```
POST https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/<region>/<uid>/action
{"action":"backup"}
```

Replace `<region>` with the geographical region of the Instance. This value can be `fr-par-1` for Instances located in Paris, for example. Replace `<uid>` with the unique identifier of the Instance.

By default, the name of the image is built according to the name of the server and the date:
```
image_<servername>_YYYY-MM-DD_hh-mm.
```

Alternatively you can specify a name for the image in the request:
```
POST https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/<region>/servers/<id>/action
{ "action":"backup", "name":"myimagename" }
```

A backup request will create an Image object (Visible in the `href_result`: `/images/<image_uuid>`)

```
GET https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/<region>/images/<image_uid>
```

An Image contains one snapshot for each volume of the instance. These snapshots are visible within the Image response, as `root_volume` and `extra_volumes` fields

### Deleting a backup 


To delete the image that contains a backup run the following call:

```
DELETE https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/<region>/images/<image_uid>
```

It is also recommended to remove every snapshot related to the image by running the following API call for each snaphot that is no longer needed:

```
DELETE https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/<region>/snapshots/<snapshot_uid>
```
