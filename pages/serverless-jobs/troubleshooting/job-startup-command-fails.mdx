## Problem

My job run fails due to its startup command.

## Cause

Complex commands, such as piped or `xargs` commands may lead to failures due to techical limitations of Serverless Jobs.

## Possible solutions

You can bypass this issue by using [Secret Manager](/secret-manager/) to pass complex commands in a shell script file via a [secret reference](/serverless-jobs/concepts/secrets-references). Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/serverless-jobs/how-to/execute-complex-commands/) for more information
