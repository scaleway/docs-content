## Deploying the Gogs Instance

1. Click **Create an Instance**. The Instance creation wizard displays.

2. Choose the **Gogs** image in the **InstantApps** tab.

3. Follow the remaining steps to [create your Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/).

## Opening the mail ports to send e-mails

To avoid spam, remote mail ports cannot be reached from our infrastructure by default. As Discourse requires to send mail, we need to open them. Your account needs to be validated to perform this operation. To get your account reviewed, please [contact our assistance](https://console.scaleway.com/support/).

1. Click the **Security Groups** tab in the Instances overview page.

2. Click **Create a new Security Group** and input the security group name and description.

3. Check the **Enable SMTP** box to unblock the mail ports.

4. Return to the overview tab and select the security group you created in step 2.

The new Security Group configuration will be applied automatically on Virtual Cloud Instances.

## Configuring Gogs

When your server is running, you can see the server's IP address in the server list on the control panel.

1. Connect to your server with SSH to recover the database password for Gogs.

  Once you are connected to your server, the following message appear on your screen:
