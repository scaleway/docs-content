## OpenAI client libraries

Scaleway Generative APIs follow OpenAI's API structure, making integration straightforward. To get started, you'll need to install the OpenAI library and set up your API key.

### Configuration

To use the OpenAI client library with Scaleway's Generative APIs, first install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install openai
```

Then set the API key and base URL in your OpenAI-compatible client:
```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.scaleway.ai/v1",
    api_key="<API secret key>"
)
```
<Message type="tip">
  Make sure to replace `<API secret key>` with your actual API key.
</Message>

### Using OpenAI client for text generation

To use OpenAI client for text generation, you can create a `client.chat.completions` object and call the `create` method:
```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke about AI"}]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## LangChain (RAG & LLM applications)

LangChain is a popular library for building AI applications. Scaleway's Generative APIs support LangChain for both inference and embeddings.

### Python
<Message type="tip">
  Refer to our dedicated documentation for [implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain and Scaleway Generative APIs](/tutorials/how-to-implement-rag-generativeapis/)
</Message>

## LlamaIndex (advanced RAG applications)

LlamaIndex is an open-source framework for building Large Language Models (LLMs) based applications, especially optimizing RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipelines. 
1. Install the required dependencies to use the LlamaIndex framework with Scaleway's Generative APIs:
```bash
pip install llama-index-llms-openai-like
```

2. Create a file `main.py` and add the following code to it to configure the `OpenAILike` client and your secret key:
```python
from llama_index.llms.openai_like import OpenAILike
from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage

llm = OpenAILike(
  model="llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
  api_key="<API secret key>",
  api_base="https://api.scaleway.ai/v1",
  max_tokens=512,
  temperature=0.7,
  top_p=1,
  presence_penalty=0,
)
```
<Message type="tip">
    Make sure to replace `<API secret key>` with your actual API key.
</Message>

3. You can then interact with the LLM by sending messages to the model with the following code:
```python
response = llm.chat([ChatMessage("Could you tell me about Scaleway please ?")])
print(response)
```

4. Finally, run `main.py`:
```python
python main.py
```
The LLM response should display an answer:
```bash
Generally, Scaleway is a reliable and secure cloud provider that offers a range of services for businesses and developers.
```

### Javascript (Typescript)

To perform chat conversations with Langchain, first install `langchain` and `@langchain/openai` packages using your node package manager.

1. Use the following command to install Langchain using `npm` (`yarn` and `pnpm` are also available):
    ```bash
    npm install langchain @langchain/openai
    ```

2. Edit your `package.json` file to ensure it has the `"type": "module"` property:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "module",
      "dependencies": {
        "@langchain/openai": "^0.4.4",
        "langchain": "^0.3.19"
      }
    }
    ```

3. Create a `main.js` file and add the following content to it:
    ```js
    import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

    const chat = new ChatOpenAI({
        apiKey: "<API secret key>",
        model: "llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
        configuration: {
            baseURL: "https://api.scaleway.ai/v1",
        }
      });

    const response = await chat.invoke("Tell me a joke");
    console.log(response.content);
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      Make sure to replace `<API secret key>` with your actual API secret key.
    </Message>

4. Run `main.js`:
    ```bash
    node main.js
    ```
    The model answer should display:
    ```bash
    Why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself? Because it was two-tired.
    ```

Note that other Langchain objects from OpenAI client library are also compatible, such as `OpenAI` and `OpenAIEmbeddings`.

  -d '{
    "model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is quantum computing?"}]
  }'
```

    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
data = {
    "model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain black holes"}]
}
response = requests.post("https://api.scaleway.ai/v1/chat/completions", json=data, headers=headers)
print(response.json()["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```
