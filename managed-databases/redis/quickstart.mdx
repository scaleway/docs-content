## How to create a Redis™ Database Instance

Managed Database for Redis™ is a low-latency caching solution based on in-memory data storage. It allows you to easily set up a secure cache and lighten the load on your main database.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

1. Click **Redis™** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. If you do not have a database already created, the creation page displays.
2. Click **Create Redis™ Database Instance**. The creation wizard displays.
3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Choose an Availability Zone. This is the geographical location where your database will be deployed.

    <Message type="note">
      Managed Database for Redis™ are available in PAR1, PAR2, AMS1, AMS2, WAW1 and WAW2.
    </Message>

    - Select the version of Redis™ you wish to use on your Instance.
    - Select a database configuration. You can choose between:
        - **Cluster mode**: creates the database as a cluster composed of three or more nodes. The cluster uses partitioning to split the keyspace. Each partition is replicated and can be reassigned or elected as the primary when necessary.
        - **Standalone**: creates a standalone database provisioned on a single node.
    - Select a node type.
4. Configure your network. You can select either:

    - **Private Network**: allows your databases to communicate in an isolated and secure network without requiring a public IP address. If you select this option, you must either:
        - select an existing Private Network to attach from the drop-down or
        - create and attach a new one

    <Message type="important">
      If you want to use Private Networks, you must select the option upon creation. It is not possible to add the Redis™ Database Instance to a Private Network once it has been created.
    </Message>

    <Message type="note">
      Your private IP addresses are automatically allocated. They are managed via an IP Address Manager (IPAM). You can retrieve them on the Private Network tab of your Database Instance. To allocate IPs manually, you can use the Scaleway API and CLI, or Terraform.
    </Message>

    - **Public network**: resources in a public network are publicly visible by default. The default Access Control List (ACL) settings allow anybody to connect to resources in your network. You can restrict access by configuring ACLs.
5. Complete the remaining steps in the creation wizard:
    - Create credentials: add a name and set a password for your user.
    <Message type="important">
      Your username must adhere to specific criteria. It must:
        - contain only letters, numbers, hyphens, dollars, and underscores
        - be between 1 and 63 characters long
        - not start with `_rkv`
        - start with a letter
        - not be `scalewayadmin` or `metrics`
    </Message>
    - Enter a name and optional tags for the database.
6. Click **Create Redis™ Database Instance** to confirm your choices and launch creation.

## How to delete a Redis™ Database Instance

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [Redis™ Database Instance](/managed-databases/redis/how-to/create-a-database-for-redis)

1. Click **Redis™** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the database information page.
3. Scroll down the page to the **Delete Database Instance** section and click **Delete Database Instance**. A pop-up appears to inform that:
    <Message type="important">
      This action is irreversible and will permanently delete the Database Instance and all its associated data.
    </Message>
4. Type **DELETE** to confirm and click **Delete Database Instance**.
    <Message type="tip">
      Alternatively, you can delete your database from your Database Instances list by clicking <Icon name="more" /> next to the database name and then **Delete**.
