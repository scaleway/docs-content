You must always keep the contact details relating to the owner of your domain name accurate and up to date. This can be done by [following the instructions here](/dedibox-network/domains/how-to/file-contact-info). However, if you wish to change details pertaining to the identity of the owner (full name(s) of a natural person or corporate name for a legal entity) this must be done by the change of ownership process described below.

<Message type="important">

Before changing the ownership of the domain, you must [ensure that all contact email addresses of the domain are up to date.](#how-to-check-and-update-the-contact-email)

</Message>

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net) 
  - You have a domain registered with Scaleway, which you want to transfer to a new owner
  - The new owner of the domain has [created a Dedibox account](/dedibox-console/my-account/how-to/create-a-dedibox-account)

</Message>

2. Click **Configure domain name** next to the relevant domain.

3. Click the link next to **Handle**. You are directed to the contact details page.

4. Check the details (particularly the email address), rectifying any that are incorrect.

5. Ensure the **ANTI SPAM** feature is set to **Inactive**.

6. If you have made changes, scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Update handle data**.

6. Create a handle for the new owner, containing all their contact details, and click **Confirm**.

7. Confirm the ownership trade and pay the administrative fee.

8. For the extensions `.fr`, `.eu` and `.be`, emails will be sent to both the old and new owners of the domain. Both parties are required to validate the trade by clicking the enclosed link. Without this action, the change of ownership will not be validated. 

  <Message type="important">
    
    The link in the email is valid for one month. After this it expires, and to get a new validation link you will need to restart the change of ownership process. A new administrative fee will be applied.

  </Message>

  For the extensions `.com`, `.net` and `.org`, the validation is done directly once your change of ownership request is confirmed.

To verify that the change of ownership has been successfully carried out, you can use [http://who.is/](http://who.is/).

## How to transfer web hosting

Once the ownership change is confirmed, you may wish to transfer your web hosting from the old owner's account to the new one.

1. From the old ownership account, back up your FTP and SQL data as well as the emails associated with the old account. 

2. Cancel the web hosting service using the following link in your management console: [https://console.online.net/en/account/services](https://console.online.net/en/account/services).

3. Wait for the cancellation request to go through. This may take a few minutes. You then see that the hosting service is no longer visible in the old account.

4. Log into the [mangaement console](https://console.online.net) with the new ownership account.

5. Order the domain with web hosting.

6. Wait for the service to be delivered. This may take a few minutes.

7. Reconfigure the FTP access, any SQL databases and your email mailboxes and upload your backup to put the site back online.
