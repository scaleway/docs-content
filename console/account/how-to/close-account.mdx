You can close your account using two methods:

- by deactivating your Organization, which allows you to [reactivate it](#how-to-reactivate-an-organization) at a later date
- by permanently deleting your account and personal data.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Ownership](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) of the Organization you intend to delete

## How to deactivate your Organization

Deactivating an Organization will permanently delete your Organization's servers, resources, services, and backups. It will also deactivate the account. However, you can choose to reactivate your account at a later date, eliminating the need to recreate an account from scratch.

<Message type="note">
  There is a delay of up to 10 days between the time your Organization is closed and the time your resources are effectively deleted. We recommend you to manually delete all your resources before you close your Organization.

1. Open the Organization drop-down menu at the top-right corner of the Scaleway console, and click the name of the Organization.
2. Select the **Settings** tab.
3. Scroll down to the **Deactivate Organization** section.
4. Click the **Deactivate Organization** button once you have read and agreed with the warning message.
    <Message type="note">
      The **Deactivate Organization** button only displays if you are the [Owner](/console/account/concepts/#owner) of your [Organization](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#organization).
    </Message>
5. Type **Deactivate**, then click **Continue Deactivation** to confirm your decision.
6. Select the reasons why you are deactivating your Organization.
7. Click **Deactivate Organization**. A message appears to confirm the deactivation has been scheduled.

## How to reactivate an Organization

When you deactivate your Organization, you can request that it be reactivated at any time.

[Open a support ticket](/console/account/how-to/open-a-support-ticket) to request reactivation.

## How to delete your account and personal data

Using this option will permanently delete your account. You will not be able to reactivate your Organization at a later date, and your personal data will be permanently deleted.

<Message type="note">
  Once you make this request, you will no longer be able to access your account or invoices. The request will take at least 72 hours to be processed. You must make sure all your bills are paid, and that you have not used any resources since the beginning of the current calendar month.
