You can now manage your SNS subscriptions [directly from the Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/messaging/protocols/). You can subscribe to HTTP/S endpoints and Serverless Compute resources (Functions & Containers). 
You can refer to our documentation to find out [how to create and manage SNS subscriptions](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-subscriptions/).
