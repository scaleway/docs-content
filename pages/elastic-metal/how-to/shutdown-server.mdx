An Elastic Metal server can be shut down from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com). This powers off the physical server.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An Elastic Metal server [installed](/elastic-metal/quickstart/#how-to-create-an-elastic-metal-server)


1. Click **Elastic Metal** in the **Bare Metal** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Elastic Metal dashboard displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the server you want to shut down. A drop-down menu displays.
3. Click **Power off** in the menu.
4. Confirm that you have shut down the operating system and click **Power off Elastic Metal server** to power off the server.
    <Message type="important">
      Make sure to stop your operating system by executing the `halt` command
      before shutting off the server. Otherwise, you risk damaging the file system
      and causing data loss.
