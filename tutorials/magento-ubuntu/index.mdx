Magento is one of the most popular e-commerce systems available, with more than 100.000 online stores based on the platform. It is written in PHP and uses the Zend Framework. Database-wise it uses the MySQL or MariaDB relational database system.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to install the open-source version of Magento on a Scaleway Instance running on Ubuntu Focal Fossa (20.04 LTS). To support the tool, we will deploy a LAMP stack (Ubuntu Linux, Apache2, MariaDB, and PHP).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) and [connected to](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/) a Scaleway Instance with at least 2 GB RAM
- Configured a domain name to point toward the IP address of your Instance ([A or AAAA record](/network/domains-and-dns/concepts/#resource-records))
- [Created a free Magento account](https://account.magento.com/customer/account/create/)

## Getting the Instance ready

1. Update the APT package manager and upgrade the software installed on the server to ensure your system is up-to-date.
    ```
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```
2. Magento relies on a web server to deliver content. Install the Apache2 web server using the APT package manager with the following command:
    ```
    sudo apt install apache2
    ```
3. Start and enable Apache2.
    ```
    systemctl start apache2.service
    systemctl enable apache2.service
    ```
4. Download the pre-required packages and repositories to install PHP. Then, update the APT package cache.
    ```
    sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common
    sudo apt-get update
    ```
5. Install the required PHP packages.
    ```
    apt install php7.4 libapache2-mod-php7.4 php7.4-common php7.4-gmp php7.4-curl php7.4-soap php7.4-bcmath php7.4-intl php7.4-mbstring php7.4-xmlrpc php7.4-mysql php7.4-gd php7.4-xml php7.4-cli php7.4-zip
    ```
6. Then, authorize the `PHP` and `rewrite` apache modules.
    ```
    sudo a2enmod php7.4
    sudo a2enmod rewrite
    ```
7. Restart apache2.
    ```
    systemctl restart apache2.service
    ```

    When the installation is complete, you should see a warning message:
    ```
    Do not run Composer as root/super user! See https://getcomposer.org/root for details
    ```
## Creating an SSH user

To avoid running Composer as root, we will create a sudo user and grant it root permissions.

1. Create a new user. Replace `username` with the name of your choice. Enter a password for the user when prompted.
    ```
    sudo adduser username
    ```
2. Add the user to the sudo group.
    ```
    usermod -aG sudo username
    ```
3. Run the following command to open the `/etc/sudoers` file:
    ```
    visudo
    ```
4. Add the following permissions in the last line:
    ```
    username  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
    ```
5. Save and close.

## Downloading Magento

1. Log into your sudo user.
    ```
    su - username
    ```
2. Check into the directory you want to install Magento in.
    ```
    cd /home/username
    ```
3. Use composer to install the tool.
    ```
    sudo composer create-project --repository=https://repo.magento.com/ magento/project-community-edition magento2
    ```
4. When prompted, enter your username and password. These are your Magento public key and private key, respectively. You can generate Magento access keys on [this page](https://marketplace.magento.com/customer/accessKeys/).
    ```
    Authentication required (repo.magento.com):
      Username: <MAGENTO_PUBLIC_KEY>
      Password: <MAGENTO_PRIVATE_KEY>
    ```
The installation proceeds.

<Message type="note">
  Installation may take some time. This is normal behavior, and you can wait for its completion. During the execution of the command you may see some messages about the cache, but you can safely ignore them.
</Message>

## Configuring Apache

1. Log back into the root user by running:
    ```
    exit;
    ```
2. Open the following file with the text editor of your choice:
    ```
    nano /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
    ```
3. Edit and save the file according to the example below. Replace `/home/username/magento2` with the path to the directory where Magento is installed, and `example.com` with your domain name.
    ```
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    DocumentRoot /home/username/magento2
    ServerName example.com
    ServerAlias www.example.com
    ```
4. Open the `envvars` file with a text editor of your choice.
    ```
    nano /etc/apache2/envvars
    ```
5. Replace `www-data` with your SSH username in the following lines.
    ```
    export APACHE_RUN_USER=www-data
    export APACHE_RUN_GROUP=www-data
    ```
    Then, save and exit.
6. Open and edit the `apache2.conf` file.
    ```
    nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
    ```
7. Edit the `<Directory /var/www/>` code block according to the example below. Replace `username` with your SSH username. Then, save and exit.
    ```
    <Directory /home/username/magento2/>
            Options FollowSymLinks
            AllowOverride All
            Require all granted
    </Directory>
    ```
## Setting up PHP

As Magento has specific requirements for PHP, it is recommended to modify the PHP configuration file.

1. Open the file in a text editor.
    ```
    nano /etc/php/7.4/apache2/php.ini
    ```
2. Modify parameters as indicated below, save and exit.
    ```sh no-copy
    file_uploads = On
    allow_url_fopen = On
    short_open_tag = On
    memory_limit = 4096M
    cgi.fix_pathinfo = 0
    opcache.save_comments = 1
    upload_max_filesize = 150M
    max_execution_time = 1800
    realpath_cache_size=10M
    realpath_cache_ttl=7200
    date.timezone = Europe/Paris
    ```
3. Restart Apache.
    ```
    service apache2 restart
    ```

## Setting up MariaDB

1. Install the MariaDB database server and client using the APT package manager. MariaDB is an open-source fork of the MySQL relational database system and provides compatibility with all MySQL commands. Magento has been tested to comply with all MariaDB features.
    ```
    apt install mariadb-server mariadb-client
    ```
2. Initialize the MariaDB database server by running the following command:
    ```
    sudo mysql_secure_installation
    ```

    You will be prompted to answer the following questions during installation:

    - **Enter current password for root (enter for none):** Press enter to continue, as the default MariaDB root password is empty.
    - **Set root password? [Y/n]:** Type **Y** and press enter to continue.
    - **New password:** Enter a secret password of your choice and press enter to continue.
    - **Re-enter new password:** Repeat your password and press enter to confirm.
    - **Remove anonymous users? [Y/n]:** Type **Y**, then press enter
    - **Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n]:** Type **Y** and confirm by pressing enter.
    - **Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n]:** Type **Y** and press enter to continue.
    - **Reload privilege table now? [Y/n]:** Confirm by typing **Y**, then press enter.
3. Now that the database engine is configured, log into MariaDB using the `root` user and enter the password set in the previous step when prompted:
    ```
    mysql
    ```
4. Create a new database for Magento by running the following command in the MariaDB shell:
    ```
    CREATE DATABASE magento;
    ```
5. Create a user for Magento. Replace `your_secret_password` with a password for the user to authenticate:
    ```
    CREATE USER 'magento_db'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_secret_password';
    ```
6. Grant the newly created user all permissions on the `magento` database:
    ```
    GRANT ALL ON magento.* TO 'magento_db'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_secret_password' WITH GRANT OPTION;
    ```
7. Save the changes and quit the MariaDB shell:
    ```
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    EXIT;
    ```

## Downloading and installing Elasticsearch

Since the 2.4 version of Magento has been released, it uses [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) as the catalog search engine. Install it by following these steps:

1. Elasticsearch uses a secure HTTPS transaction for its repositories. If not installed yet, install the `apt-transport-https` package to use the `apt` package manager:
    ```
    apt-get install apt-transport-https
    ```
2. Import the Elasticsearch PGP key:
    ```
    wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -
    ```
3. Create a new `sources` file for the Elasticsearch repository:
    ```
    echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main" | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list
    ```
4. Update the `apt` package manager and install Elasticsearch using it:
    ```
    apt-get update && sudo apt-get install elasticsearch
    ```
5. Start the Elasticsearch service to make sure it is up and running:
    ```
    service elasticsearch start
    ```
6. Edit the `vm.max_map_count` parameter in the elastic search configuration file.
    ```
    sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
    echo "vm.max_map_count=262144" | tee /etc/sysctl.d/elasticsearch.conf
    ```
7. Restart Elasticsearch.
    ```
    service elasticsearch restart
    ```

## Installing Magento

1. Change into the directory where Magento is located in your Instance.
    ```
    cd /home/username/magento2
    ``` 
2. Run the command below to install Magento. Replace the variables in the command to match your previous configuration and set the username and password for your Magento `admin` user.
    ```
    sudo bin/magento setup:install --base-url=http://example.com/ --db-host=localhost --db-name=magento --db-user=magento_db --db-password=your_secret_password --admin-firstname=Admin --admin-lastname=User --admin-email=admin@example.com --admin-user=admin --admin-password=admin123 --language=en_US --currency=EUR --timezone=Europe/Paris --use-rewrites=1
    ```
3. Restart Apache.
    ```
    sudo service apache2 restart
    ```
4. Rewrite `a2enmod`.
    ```
    sudo a2enmod rewrite
    ```
5. Enable Magento.
    ```
    sudo chmod -R 755 /home/username/magento2
    sudo chown -R username:username /home/username/magento2
    ```
6. Restart Apache once more.
    ```
    sudo systemctl restart apache2.service
    ```

## Securing the connection using Let's Encrypt

By default, plain HTTP connections are not encrypted and data is transmitted in clear text over the internet. To secure the connection between your users and the e-commerce site, a TLS/SSL certificate is highly recommended. We therefore request a free TLS certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). We use [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) to obtain and renew the certificate automatically for us.

1. Install `certbot` using the APT package manager:
    ```
    apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-apache
    certbot --apache
    ```
2. Follow the steps prompted by Certbot to obtain your certificate and reconfigure the Apache2 web server.
3. You can now check your storefront by pointing your web browser to your domain name to check everything is working:

## Setting up the Magento admin interface

The Magento admin interface allows you to manage your customers and products, and also customize the pages of your shop.

<Message type="note">
  For more information about the admin interface, refer to the official [Magento documentation](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/configuration/configuration-basic.html).
</Message>

The interface is available on a customized URL, which was displayed during the installation of your shop.

1. Type the customized URL into your browser.
  Magento 2.4 sets up two-factor authentication by default. To make your first log in to the admin interface seamless, we will disable 2FA via command line. You can enable it on the admin interface at a later time.
2. Disable 2FA with the following command:
    ```
    php bin/magento module:disable Magento_TwoFactorAuth
    ```
3. Log into the admin using the credentials configured during the initial setup of Magento.
