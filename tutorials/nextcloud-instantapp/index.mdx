In this tutorial we show you how to can deploy your personal cloud storage with the [Nextcloud](https://www.nextcloud.com) InstantApp in seconds. Nextcloud allows you to create a self-hosted cloud storage to host files, folders, contacts, photo galleries, calendars and more on your instance.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your SSH key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key)
</Message>

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Instance creation page displays.
2. Click **Create an Instance**. The Instance creation wizard displays.
3. Choose the **Nextcloud** image in the **InstantApps** tab.
4. Follow the remaining steps to [create your Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/).

## Opening the mail ports to send emails

To avoid spam, remote mail ports cannot be reached from our infrastructure by default. As NextCloud requires sending mail, we need to open the ports. Your account needs to be validated to perform this operation. To get your account reviewed, please [contact our assistance](https://console.scaleway.com/support/).

1. Click the **Security Groups** tab in the Instances overview page.
2. Click **Create a new security group** and input the security group name and description.
3. Check the **Enable SMTP** box to unblock the mail ports.
4. Return to the overview tab and select the security group you created in step 2.

    The new security group configuration is automatically applied to the Instances.

## Configuring Nextcloud

When the Instance is running, you can see the Instance's IP address in the server list on the control panel.

1. Copy the IP address and open an [SSH session](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance) to find the database credentials required for NextCloud.

    The MySQL password appears in the MOTD message that displays upon your first connection to the server:

2. Open a web browser and enter: `http://YOUR.CLOUD.SERVER.IP/nextcloud` (For example if your Instance's IP is `212.47.0.0` the input must be: `http://212.47.0.0/nextcloud`).

    The installation script prompts you to include a username and password as well as the database credentials.
3. Fill in the required information and press **Enter** to finalize the installation:

<Message type="note">
  The installation takes a few seconds to complete. 
</Message>

## Log in to Nextcloud

Once the installation completes, you are redirected to the login page.

Enter the username and password you set previously and press **Enter** on your keyboard:

You are now connected to your personal cloud storage and can start using it!
