A firewall controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. Typically, it establishes a barrier between a trusted (internal) network and an untrusted external network, like the internet.

UFW, or **[Uncomplicated FireWall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncomplicated_Firewall)**, is a frontend for [IPTables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables) to simplify the configuration of your firewall.

## Installing UFW

UFW is available as a pre-built package in the apt repositories of Ubuntu. It can be easily installed via apt:

  ```code
  sudo apt-get install ufw
  ```

## Configuring security policies

Security policies applied by the firewall on your server depend on your needs and the applications you use.

The most secure configuration is to block all traffic, inbound and outbound by default and to allow ports on a case-by-case policy.

In this tutorial, we will configure a policy that blocks inbound packets and authorizes outbound traffic by default.

1. Start by defining the policy, that refuses everything by default:
    ```code
    sudo ufw default deny
    ```
2. Enable outgoing traffic.
    ```code
    sudo ufw default allow outgoing
    ```

## Establishing rules

To define rules, you have to know which services are running on the server and which are their associated ports.

In this example, an SSH server, HTTP(S) and a DNS server are running on the machine.

Every known protocol uses an associated port from the [well known ports list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers).

The services running on the machine used in this example need the following ports:

- Port 22 / TCP for SSH
- Port 80 / TCP for HTTP
- Port 443 / TCP for HTTPS
- Port 53 / TCP & UDP for DNS

1. Authorize SSH.
    ```code
    sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
    ```
2. Authorize HTTP.
    ```code
    sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
    ```
3. Authorize HTTPS.
    ```code
    sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
    ```
4. Authorize DNS.
    ```code
    sudo ufw allow 53
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      In this case `TCP` has not to be specified, as both, `TCP` and `UDP` are needed.
    </Message>
5. Activate the new rules.
    ```code
    sudo ufw enable
    ```
6. Verify the configuration.
    ```code
    sudo ufw status numbered
    ```

    A list of all configured rules displays:

    ```code
    Status: active

        To                         Action      From
        --                         ------      ----
    [ 1] 22/tcp                     ALLOW IN    Anywhere
    [ 2] 80/tcp                     ALLOW IN    Anywhere
    [ 3] 443/tcp                    ALLOW IN    Anywhere
    [ 4] 53                         ALLOW IN    Anywhere
    [ 5] 22/tcp (v6)                ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
    [ 6] 80/tcp (v6)                ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
    [ 7] 443/tcp (v6)               ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
    [ 8] 53 (v6)                    ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
    ```

## Adding more rules

As the firewall is running now, it is possible to add more rules to it:

Allow the connection to port 25 (SMTP) via TCP to the server:

```code
sudo ufw allow 25/TCP
```

## Deleting rules

Over the time you may recognize, that some of the rules you defined previously do not match your requirements anymore.

1. Display the list of all defined rules:
    ```code
    sudo ufw status numbered
    ```

  The numbers at the beginning of each row are the number of the rule in UFW.
2. To delete a rule, find its number and type:
    ```code
    sudo ufw delete NUMBER
    ```
