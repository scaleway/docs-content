The IBEX-Q1 by **Alpine Quantum Technologies** (AQT) brings trapped-ion technology to the QaaS portfolio. Known for its extremely high fidelity and long coherence time, the IBEX QPU offers all-to-all connectivity between its qubits, simplifying complex circuit design. The device is rack-mountable, operates at room temperature, and consumes less than 2 kilowatts, ideal for precision-critical simulations (like fluid dynamics).

## Key Features
* **All-to-all connectivity:** All-to-All Connectivity: Every qubit is connected to every other qubit. This eliminates the need for SWAP gates, significantly reducing circuit depth and error rates.
* **High fidelity:** Trapped ions offer some of the lowest error rates in the industry for 2-qubit gates.
* **Room temperature operation:** The system fits in standard rack cabinets and does not require the massive dilution refrigerators needed for superconducting qubits.

## Use cases
Thanks to its connectivity, the IBEX-Q1 QPU is particularly well suited for:
* **Combinatorial optimization:** Problems where variables are highly interdependent (finance, logistics).
* **Quantum simulation:** Simulating complex molecules where entanglement structure is dense.
* **Deep circuits:** Algorithms requiring long computation times before decoherence sets in.
