GitLab Runner is a powerful tool that executes CI/CD jobs in GitLab.
When hosted on Kubernetes, it leverages the scalability and resilience of container orchestration to efficiently manage and run your pipelines.
By deploying GitLab Runner on a Kubernetes cluster, you can dynamically scale the number of runners based on demand, ensure high availability, and seamlessly integrate with your existing Kubernetes infrastructure.
This setup enables you to optimize resource utilization, reduce overhead, and enhance the performance of your continuous integration and deployment processes.

<Macro id="requirements" />
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
- Created a Scaleway Kubernetes [Kapsule](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/) or [Kosmos](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-kosmos-cluster/) cluster

## Deploying the GitLab Runner application using Easy Deploy

1. In the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/), navigate to the **Kubernetes** section under **Containers**.
2. Click the name of the cluster where you wish to deploy GitLab Runner. The **Cluster Information** tab will display.
3. Click the **Easy Deploy** tab. The application dashboard displays.
4. Click **Deploy Application**. The application deployment wizard displays.
5. Choose **Application Library** to see the list of available applications.
6. Select the **GitLab Runner** application.

        If you cannot find GitLab Runner on the first page, use the search bar or navigate through the library using the arrow buttons.
    </Message>
7. Optionally, customize the default configuration for GitLab Runner using [Helm Charts](/tutorials/kubernetes-package-management-helm/). If you do not require any customized configuration you can skip this step.
8. Enter a name (e.g. `gitlab-runner`) and a Kubernetes namespace for your application. If no name is entered, GitLab Runner will be installed in the default namespace of the cluster.
9. Click **Deploy Application** to deploy GitLab Runner on your Kubernetes cluster.
10. Verify that the GitLab Runner is successfully installed and running:
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n default # replace "default" with the name of the Kubernetes namespace in which you have installed your GitLab Runner.
    ```
    You should see a pod with a name similar to `gitlab-runner-xxxxxx-xxxxx` in the `Running` state.

## Configuring a GitLab CI/CD pipeline to use your Kubernetes Runner

1. In your GitLab repository, create or edit the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to include a job that uses the Kubernetes runner.
    Below you can find an example `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

    ```yaml
    stages:
      - build
      - test

    build:
      stage: build
      script:
        - echo "Building the project..."
        - # Add your build steps here
      tags:
        - k8s-runner

    test:
      stage: test
      script:
        - echo "Running tests..."
        - # Add your test steps here
      tags:
        - k8s-runner
    ```

    Ensure the `tags` key matches the tag assigned to your runner.

2. Push your changes to your GitLab repository. The GitLab CI/CD pipeline should start automatically, using the Kubernetes runner for the jobs.
    ```bash
    git add .gitlab-ci.yml
    git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline configuration"
    git push origin main
    ```

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, you can check the logs of the GitLab Runner pod:

```bash
kubectl logs -n default <pod-name>
```

## Conclusion
You have successfully set up a GitLab Runner hosted on Kubernetes and configured your GitLab CI/CD pipeline to use it. This setup allows you to leverage the scalability and flexibility of Kubernetes for your CI/CD workflows.
For more information how to configure your GitHub Runner, refer to the [official GitHub documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/kubernetes.html#configuring-gitlab-runner-using-the-helm-chart).
