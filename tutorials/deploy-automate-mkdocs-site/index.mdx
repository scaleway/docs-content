This tutorial is the second in a series on building and deploying websites using the Scaleway ecosystem. In the [first tutorial](/tutorials/using-bucket-website-with-mkdocs/), we covered how to configure your website. Now, we will walk you through the process of building and deploying it using GitHub Actions CI/CD, the [Object Storage bucket website](/object-storage/concepts/#bucket-website) feature, and MkDocs.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a bucket](/object-storage/how-to/create-a-bucket/) and [enabled the bucket website feature](/object-storage/how-to/use-bucket-website/)
- [Created a GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) containing Markdown files that will be used to generate documentation
- Admin rights on the GitHub repository to create secrets for storing API keys and other variables
- [Installed Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Installed pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
- [Installed MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/installation/#installing-mkdocs) locally
- Followed [our MkDocs tutorial](/tutorials/using-bucket-website-with-mkdocs/) or created an MkDocs project

## Setting up your MkDocs project

1. Access the repository of your MkDocs project and make sure that the folder containing your Markdown files is named `docs`.
2. In your `mkdocs.yml` file, add the following content. Make sure you replace `your-website-url` with your website's URL, `your-repository` with the name of your GitHub repository, and `username/your-repository/` with your GitHub username and repository.
        ```
        site_url: https://your-website-url.s3-website.fr-par.scw.cloud
        repo_url: https://github.com/your-repository/
        repo_name: username/your-repository/
        ```
3. [Preview your MkDocs project](/tutorials/using-bucket-website-with-mkdocs/#preview-your-website) locally. Make sure your website's content displays as expected and that there are no broken links.
4. Run `mkdocs build` to generate your project's static pages. This will create a folder named `site` in your repository.
5. [Deploy](/tutorials/using-bucket-website-with-mkdocs/#deploy-your-website) your website.

## Configuring an IAM application and policy

1. [Create an IAM application](/iam/how-to/create-application/). For the purpose of this documentation, we are naming our application `doc website GitHub Actions`. This application will allow GitHub Actions to interact with your Object Storage bucket.
2. [Create an IAM policy](/iam/how-to/create-policy/) and select **Application** in the **Select a principal** drop-down.
3. Select your application (`doc website GitHub Actions`) in the **Select or type an application drop-down**, then click **Add rules**.
4. Select the **Access to resources** [scope](/iam/concepts/#scope), select the Scaleway Project containing your bucket in the drop-down, then click **Validate**. You are prompted to add permission sets.
5. Click **Storage** under the **Products** section, select the `ObjectStorageFullAccess` permission set, and click **Validate**.
6. Click **Create policy**.

## Adding statements to your bucket policy

Statements allow you to define who can perform what actions on your bucket. In this section, we will add a statement to allow your IAM application to push content to your bucket, and another one that grants public read access to your website's content.

1. From the Scaleway console side-menu, click **Storage**, then click **Object Storage**.
2. Click your bucket, then click the **Bucket settings** tab.
3. Click **View policy details** in the **Bucket policy** section. You are redirected to the **Bucket policy information** page.
4. Click **Edit policy**. For the purpose of this documentation, we are choosing the **policy generator** method to add [statements](/object-storage/api-cli/bucket-policy/#statement).
5. Tick the **Maintain access to bucket** checkbox.
6. Click **+ Add statement**. We are defining the statement to allow your IAM application to push content to your bucket:

    - Enter a unique statement ID describing the purpose of the statement. For example `Allow IAM app to push content`.
    - Select `Applications` in the **Principals** drop-down.
    - Select your IAM application (`doc website GitHub Actions`) in the **Applications** drop-down.
    - Select `s3:PutObject` in the **Actions** drop-down.
    - Enter `*` in the the **Resource** field.

7. Click **+ Add statement** again. We are defining the statement that grants public read access to your website's content:

    - Enter a unique statement ID describing the purpose of the statement. For example `Grant public read access to website`.
    - Select `All principals (*)` in the **Principals** drop-down.
    - Select `s3:GetObject` in the **Actions** drop-down.
    - Enter `*` in the the **Resource** field. This allows anyone to read objects from your bucket.
8. Click **Save changes**.

## Setting up your GitHub repository

In this section, we will configure a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build and deploy your documentation.

1. Access your GitHub repository and create a folder named `.github`.
2. Create a folder named `workflows` inside `.github`.
3. Create a file named `deploy-docs.yml` inside `workflows`.
          The architecture of your repository should look like the following:
          ```
            documentation-website-repository/
            └─ .github/
            └─ workflows/
                └─ deploy-docs.yml
          ```
4. Paste the following template into `deploy-docs.yml` and save and merge your changes.

```bash
name: Build and push website documentation

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - master
permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: actions
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Pull Material for MKdocs image and build doc
        run: |
          docker pull squidfunk/mkdocs-material
          docker run --rm -i -v ${PWD}:/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material build
      - name: Download and set up AWS CLI
        run: |
          sudo apt update
          sudo apt install curl unzip -y
          curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64-2.22.20.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
          unzip awscliv2.zip
          sudo ./aws/install --update
      - name: Set up AWS credentials
        env:
          DOC_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.DOC_ACCESS_KEY }}
          DOC_SECRET_KEY: ${{ secrets.DOC_SECRET_KEY }}
        run: |
          aws configure set aws_access_key_id $DOC_ACCESS_KEY
          aws configure set aws_secret_access_key $DOC_SECRET_KEY
          aws configure set region fr-par
      - name: Upload file to Scaleway Object Storage
        env:
          DOC_BUCKET_NAME: ${{ secrets.DOC_BUCKET_NAME }}
          DOC_S3_ENDPOINT: ${{ secrets.DOC_S3_ENDPOINT }}
        run: |
          aws s3 cp --recursive ./site/ s3://$DOC_BUCKET_NAME --endpoint-url $DOC_S3_ENDPOINT
```

## Adding your secrets in GitHub

In this section, we will be adding the following values (secrets) in our GitHub repository. This will allow the GitHub Actions workflow to access your bucket using the information in the `deploy-docs.yml` file.

- `DOC_ACCESS_KEY`: Your Scaleway API access key.
- `DOC_SECRET_KEY`: Your Scaleway API secret key.
- `DOC_BUCKET_NAME`: The name of your Scaleway bucket.
- `DOC_S3_ENDPOINT`: The Scaleway endpoint of your bucket's region. For example, if your bucket is located in `FR-PAR`, the endpoint is `https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/`.

1. Access your GitHub repository.
2. Click the **Settings** tab.
3. Click the **Secrets and varaibles** section, then click **Actions**. You are redirected to the **Secrets** tab.
4. Click **New repository secret**.
5. Enter a name and a secret for each of the values listed above. For example, enter `DOC_ACCESS_KEY` in the **Name** field, and `SCWXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` in the **Secret** field.
6. Click **Add secret** and repeat the operation for the other 3 secrets.

## Deploying your documentation

1. Make sure that the **only action** in the statement to grant read access to your bucket is `s3:GetObject`. Your statement should look like the following:
    ```
    {
      "Sid": "Grant read access to website",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "name-of-your-bucket/*"
    },
    ```
2. Access your GitHub repository.
3. Click the **Actions** tab. The name of your workflow (`Build and push website documentation to S3`) should display under **All workflows**.
4. Click the name of your workflow, then click the **Run workflow** drop-down. You are prompted to select a branch from which to run the workflow.

    | **Run workflow from `main` if**                                     | **Run workflow from other branches if** |
    |---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
    | You want to deploy an official documentation to production.         | You need to test documentation changes before merging. |
    | The documentation update is final and reviewed.                     | You are working on a feature, fix, or draft documentation update. |
    | The main branch is the source of truth for published documentation. | You want to generate a preview or staging deployment. |
    | The workflow is configured to push updates to a live website        | The workflow includes validation checks like linting, broken link detection, or build testing. |
    | The changes need to be immediately available to users.              | You are collaborating on documentation changes that require review before merging. |

5. Click **Run workflow**.

GitHub Actions will:

- build your MkDocs website,
- push the content to your Scaleway Object Storage bucket, and
- make your documentation accessible via the configured bucket URL.

## Going further

If you expect high traffic, consider using our [Edge Services](/edge-services/quickstart/) solution for caching.

If you have a custom domain, you can link it to your documentation website in your `mkdocs.yml` file.
