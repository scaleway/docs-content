Auto-generated groups and policies are now automatically created and deleted whenever a Kubernetes cluster is created or deleted.

Refer to the [auto-generated IAM resources documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/iam/reference-content/auto-generated-iam-ressources) for more information. For each creation or deletion of an auto-generated IAM resource, a log will appear on the IAM logs tab.
