Versioning is a feature designed to keep multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. When enabled, it allows you to store, retrieve, and restore every version of your objects stored in a bucket.

Versioning allows you to easily recover your objects in case of unintended user actions or application failures.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)

## How to enable versioning

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. A list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the name of the bucket in which you want to enable versioning.
3. Click the **Bucket settings** tab.
4. Scroll down and click the toggle <Icon name="toggle" /> under **Bucket versioning**. A pop-up appears.
5. Type **ENABLE** to confirm your action, then click **Enable bucket versioning** to proceed.

<Message type="note">
Once versioning is enabled, uploading an object with the same name as an existing object will create a new version of it, and will consume more storage, which may lead to higher costs.

## How to manage object versions

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. A list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the name of your selected bucket. A list of the objects it contains appears.
3. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the object you want to manage, then click **Versioning**. A list of the object versions displays.

## How to suspend versioning

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. A list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the name of your selected bucket.
3. Click the **Bucket settings** tab.
4. Scroll down and click the toggle <Icon name="toggle" /> under **Bucket versioning**. A pop-up appears.
5. Type **SUSPEND** to confirm your action, then click **Suspend bucket versioning** to proceed.

<Message type="important">
Once versioning is suspended, no new object versions will be created. Versions created up until this point will remain stored and billable. Uploading an object with the same name as an existing object will overwrite it.
