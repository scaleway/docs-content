You can now track the evolution of your sustainability metrics directly within the Console. We have added interactive dashboards to the Environmental Footprint section to help you monitor your performance over time.

You can now view your Carbon (CO₂e) and Water usage trends month over month and instantly identify usage spikes or the results of your optimization efforts via dynamic graphs. No need to download PDF reports anymore to get a high-level view of your impact.

Available now in the [Environmental Footprint tab](https://console.scaleway.com/environmental-footprint/footprint).
