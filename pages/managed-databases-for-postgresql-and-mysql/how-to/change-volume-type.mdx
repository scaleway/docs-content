It is possible to change your [volume type](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/concepts/#volume-type) anytime in the Scaleway console.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [PostgreSQL or MySQL Database Instance](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/quickstart/) with local Storage

## Important information

Since there are different types of volumes for Database Instances, make sure you are aware of the following information before changing the volume type:

- When autobackup is enabled for your local or Block volumes, regular quota limitations for backups and snapshots do not apply. Refer to the [Managed Databases FAQ page](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/faq/#why-is-my-number-of-active-backupssnapshots-exceeding-the-quota) for more information.
- When switching from a local volume to a Block volume, and if [Autobackup](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/enable-autobackup/) is enabled, be aware that the snapshot type will change. Local volumes use logical backups, whereas Block Storage employs snapshots. Both types are priced at â‚¬0.03 per GB per month, but their distinct backup methods affect storage space differently, influencing the final monthly cost based on your usage.
- Disk size cannot be reduced. Therefore, when switching from local to Block, the volume size remains the same by default.
- When switching from a Block to a local volume, make sure to select a node with a local Storage with size equal or greater than your current Block Storage. If you choose a Database Instance type with a local volume larger than your current block volume, you will be billed for the full capacity of the Database Instance.


## How to change the volume type

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Select the geographical region of the Instance you want to manage from the drop-down.
3. Click the name of the Database Instance you want to edit. The database's Overview page displays.
4. Scroll down to **Volume settings**, then click **Change volume type**.
    <Message type="important">
      Before changing the volume type, make sure your Instance is in one of the following states:
      - `READY` (represented as "Running" in the Scaleway console)
      - `DISK_FULL`
    </Message>
    A pop-up appears.
5. Select **Block Storage** from the drop-down menu.
6. Click **Update volume type** to confirm.

    The Database Instance goes into the `Initializing` state.


## The volume changing process

During the process:

- The Database Instance will display the `initializing` status, but remains available available.
- Changing the volume type can take a while, depending on the amount of data and the node type of the Database Instance. Data is synchronized between nodes in live, which means you can continue performing write operations.
    <Message type="tip">
      - Avoid performing too many write operations during the data synchronization.
      - Delay batch or scheduled scripts if possible.
    </Message>
- When all the data is synchronized, a switchover is performed between nodes of the cluster. This means that the database will be unavailable few dozen of seconds during at this time.
