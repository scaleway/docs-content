**Qsim** is a high-performance quantum circuit simulator developed by **Google Quantum AI** (via the QuantumLib initiative). It is designed to simulate quantum circuits on classical hardware with state-of-the-art performance, leveraging advanced techniques like gate fusion and AVX/SSE vectorization.

Scaleway QaaS allows you to scale Qsim beyond your local machine. You can execute your emulated computation on dedicated **CPU** or **GPU** (like Nvidia H100, L40S) seamlessly, benefiting from pre-configured, optimized environments.

## Why use Qsim on Scaleway?

* **Billed at time:** The billing starting time begins only when the Platform is fully operational and the first Job can be executed.
* **Multi-Framework support:** Uniquely, our Qsim platforms are accessible via both **Cirq** (Google's native SDK) and **Qiskit**. You can choose your preferred language while benefiting from the Qsim engine.
* **Extreme performance:** Qsim is optimized for simulating intermediate-scale quantum circuits. When coupled with Scaleway's high-end GPUs, it drastically reduces execution time for deep circuits.
* **Smart compression:** Just like our Aer offerings, the platform automatically compresses circuit data and computation results to optimize network throughput and latency.

## Option 1: Accessing via Cirq (Native)

Cirq is the native language of Qsim. Using the `cirq-scaleway` adapter allows you to run your Google Cirq circuits directly on our cloud GPUs.

### 1. Installation

```bash
pip install cirq-scaleway
```

### 2. Running on QaaS
The following example demonstrates how to run a computation on a Scaleway GPU instance. The workflow is identical to using a local emulator, but the computation happens remotely.

```python
import cirq

from cirq_scaleway import ScalewayQuantumService

# 1. Initialize the Provider
service = ScalewayQuantumService(
    project_id="<your-project-id>",
    secret_key="<your-secret-key>"
)

# 2. Get the Qsim platform
qsim_platform = service.device(name="EMU-QSIM-H100")

# 3. Create a Circuit (e.g., Bell State)
# and run in on your dedicated Qsim Session
with qsim_simulator.create_session() as session:
    qubit = cirq.GridQubit(0, 0)
    circuit = cirq.Circuit(cirq.X(qubit) ** 0.5, cirq.measure(qubit, key='m'))

    result = session.run(circuit)

    print("Result:", result)
```

## Option 2: Accessing via Qiskit

### 1. Installation

```bash
pip install qiskit-scaleway
```

### 2. Running on QaaS

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit_scaleway import ScalewayProvider

# 1. Initialize Provider
provider = ScalewayProvider(
    project_id="your-project-id",
    secret_key="your-secret-key"
)

# 2. Select the Qsim Backend
# Scaleway bridges the Qiskit circuit to the Qsim engine automatically
backend = provider.get_backend("EMU-QSIM-H100")

# 3. Create & Run Circuit
qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
qc.h(0)
qc.cx(0, 1)
qc.measure_all()

job = backend.run(qc, shots=1000)

print("Counts:", job.result().get_counts())
```

### 4. Understanding Platforms & billing
Scaleway offers different "Platforms" for emulation, ranging from standard CPU instances to high-end GPU clusters.

* **Platform selection**: When you choose a backend (e.g., EMU-AER-H100), Scaleway dynamically allocates the requested resource.
* **Session & billing**: Behind the scenes, a Session is created for your computation. Unlike QPU "shots", emulation is typically billed based on the duration of resource usage (similar to renting a cloud instance). This makes it cost-effective for running massive batches of shots or debugging complex algorithms.
* **End of billing**: It stops when you terminate your Session or after a timeout.
