[Load Balancers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/load-balancer/) are highly available and fully-managed Instances which allow you to distribute your workload across your various servers. They ensure the scaling of all your applications while securing their continuous availability, even in the event of heavy traffic. Load Balancers are commonly used to improve the performance and reliability of web sites, applications, databases and other services.

## How to create a Load Balancer

1. Click **Load Balancers** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. If you have not already created a Load Balancer, the product creation page is displayed.

2. Click **Create a Load Balancer**. The creation wizard displays.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 

    - Enter the Load Balancer **name** and **description**. Optionally, you can assign **tags** to help organize your Load Balancers.
    - Choose the **Availability Zone** in which your Load Balancer will be deployed geographically. Currently we provide the following Availability Zones:
      - `PAR1`: Paris 1, France.
      - `PAR2`: Paris 2, France (innovative and sustainable availability zone).
      - `AMS1`: Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
      - `WAW`: Warsaw, Poland.

    - Select a Load Balancer **type**.
    - Select an **IP address** for your Load Balancer. You can either allocate a new IP, or select one of your existing IPs.
    - Configure the frontend and backend.
      - **Configure frontend**. Enter a name an a port for your [frontend](/network/load-balancer/concepts/#frontends). The frontend will listen on this port, and forward received requests to the backend(s). Note that you cannot add an SSL certificate at this stage, but you can [add one after creation of the Load Balancer](/network/load-balancer/how-to/setup-ssl-offloading/).
      - **Configure backend**. Enter the following information for your [backend](/network/load-balancer/concepts/#backends):
        - Backend name
        - [Protocol](/network/load-balancer/concepts/#protocol): select TCP or HTTP depending on your required usage. The protocol is used for data transmission between the frontend/s and backend/s.
        - Port: enter the port your backend will listen on.
        - Proxy: select a [proxy protocol](/network/load-balancer/concepts/#proxy-protocol) option from the list. Depending on the type of health check you choose, you are prompted for additional information, for example HTTP healthchecks require a method (GET, PUT or POST, a URI and a response code).
        - Server IPs: enter the IP addresses of each of your backend servers.
    - Configure **advanced settings** if required:
      - **S3 failover**: activate the feature and enter a Scaleway Object Storage [Bucket Website](/storage/object/concepts/#bucket-website) URL. If none of your backend servers are available, users will be redirected to this page. 

      <Message type="note">
      
        The S3 failover feature is only available for Load Balancers using the HTTP protocol on their backend. Find out more about setting up a static website with Object Storage in our [dedicated documentation](/storage/object/how-to/use-bucket-website/).

      </Message>

      - **Sticky session**: activate the feature and enter the name for a cookie that will bind users' sessions to specific Instances.
