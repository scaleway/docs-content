This page shows you how to allow remote access to your Web Hosting databases.

By default, Web Hosting databases can only be accessed from within your hosting environment for security reasons. If you want to connect to your MySQL database remotely (for example, from your computer or a third-party server), you need to add the IP address of the device as an authorized host in cPanel.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Ordered](/webhosting/how-to/order-webhosting/) a **cPanel** Web Hosting plan
- [Created](/webhosting/how-to/manage-databases/#how-to-create-a-database) at least one database


## How to allow remote access to your Web Hosting database

1. Click **Web Hosting** in the **Domains & Web Hosting** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> and **More info**, or the domain name of the Web Hosting you want to configure. The **Hosting information** page displays.
3. Click the **Databases** tab, then click the IP address displayed next to **Databases IP** to copy it.

      Make sure that you keep it copied, as you will need it in the next steps.

4. Click the **Overview** tab, then click **Open hosting dashboard**. The cPanel login page displays in a new tab.
5. Log in to cPanel using your username and password.
6. In the cPanel search bar type `Remote Database Access` and click the first result that displays in the drop-down.

    <Message type="note">
      A host is the IP address of the device or server you want to allow to connect to your MySQL database remotely.
    </Message>
8. Optionally, add a comment in the **Comment** field. For example you can specify who the host is (`my-computer`, `IP-address-from-work`, etc.)
9. Click **Add Host** to confirm. A green message box displays informing you that the IP address was added as a host.

    <Message type="important">
      Fore security reasons, we recommend only adding trusted IP addresses.
