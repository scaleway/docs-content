Scaleway Virtual Private Cloud provides network functionalities for your Scaleway products. VPC products include Private Networks, enabling you to build a virtual L2 network between your Instances, and Public Gateways, enabling IP autoconfiguration of your Private Networks and their communication with the Internet.

## How to create a Private Network

1. Click **Private Networks** in the **VPC** section of the side menu.

2. Click the **Create a Private Network** button. The creation wizard displays.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 

    - Enter a **Name** for your Private Network, or leave the randomly-generated name in place. Optionally, you can also add **tags** (/network/vpc/concepts/#tags) to help you organize your private networks. 
    - Choose an **Availability Zone**, which is the geographical region where your Private Network will be deployed. You can only add Instances from this  same Availability Zone to the Private Network. 

4. Click **Create a Private Network** to finish. Your Private Network is created. You are taken back to the **Private Networks** dashboard, where your new Private Network is now displayed in the list.

## How to attach and detach Instances to/from a Private Network

Remember that Instances must be within the same Availability Zone as a Private Network in order to be attached to it. If you have not yet created an Instance, see how to do so [here](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/).

1. Click **Private Networks** in the **VPC** section of the side menu.

2. Click the Private Network you want to add/remove Instances to. Alternatively, click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the Private Network in question and select **More Info** from the dropdown list. You are taken to the **Overview** page for that network.

3. Click the **Attached Resources** tab.

4. Use the dropdown menu to select an Instance to add to your Private Network, then click **Add Instance**.

  <Message type="tip">

    You can also [attach Instances to a Private Network from the Instances section of the console](/compute/instances/how-to/use-private-networks#how-to-attach-instances-to-a-private-network).

  </Message>

To **detach an Instance**, use the <Icon name="unlink" /> icon next to the Instance in question to remove it from your Private Network. Confirm this action when prompted by clicking **Detach this Instance**.


## How to create a Public Gateway

1. Click **Public Gateways** in the **VPC** section of the side menu.

2. Click **Create a new Public Gateway** to launch the Public Gateway creation wizard.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 

    - Choose an **Availability Zone**, which is the geographical location in which your Public Gateway will be created. Note that in order to attach a Public Gateway to a Private Network, they must be in the same Availability Zone.
    - Choose a **Public Gateway Type**, which impacts the pricing and bandwidth of your gateway.
    - Choose an **IP**. You can choose to assign one of your existing Flexible IPs to your Public Gateway. Otherwise, a new IP will be automatically assigned here. 
    - Choose **Name** for your Public Gateway, and (optionally) a description and tags.
    - Verify the **Estimated Cost** of your Public Gateway, based on the specifications you chose.

4. Click **Create a Public Gateway** to finish. 

Your Public Gateway is created and you are redirected to the **Public Gateways** dashboard, where your newly-created Public Gateway now displays.

## How to attach your Public Gateway to your Private Network

1. Click **Public Gateways** in the **VPC** section of the side menu.
   
2. Click the Public Gateway that you want to attach to a Private Network. You are taken to the **Overview** page for that Public Gateway. 

3. Click the **Private Networks** tab. A list of Private Networks attached to the Public Gateway displays.

4. Click <Icon name="plus" /> to attach a new Private Network to the Public Gateway. A pop-up displays.

5. Choose to attach an existing or a new Private Network. The default parameters should be appropriate for most cases (DHCP enabled, subnet automatically computed, NAT enabled). However, if you wish you can alter them now, or later once you have attached the Public Gateway.

    - If you want to attach an existing Private Network, select **Attach an existing Private Network** and choose the desired network from the drop-down list.
    <Message type="note">
        Note: Only Private Networks which are in the same Availability Zone as the Public Gateway are displayed in this list.
    </Message>
    - If you want to create and attach a new Private Network, select **Attach a new Private Network**. A default name will be suggested for you, but feel free to overwrite this with a new name of your choice.
    - Choose whether to **Enable** or **Disable** the DHCP server:
        - **Enable DHCP**: The Public Gateway will dynamically assign IP addresses to Instances in the Private Network. Enabling DHCP also enables the advertisement of a default route and DNS server through the Public Gateway. Both of these options can be disabled later.
        - **Disable DHCP**: None of the above functionalities will be applied.
    - Choose the subnet you would like to use for this network, e.g. `192.168.42.0/24`. You may find the note [here](/compute/instances/how-to/use-private-networks/) helpful if you are having difficulty choosing a subnet.
    - Choose whether to **Enable** or **Disable** Dynamic NAT:
        - **Enable Dynamic NAT**: Private IP addresses in the Private Network are automatically mapped to the public IP address of the Public Gateway, enabling automatic routing of egress traffic to and from multiple devices within the Private Network. Note: you will also be able to configure static NAT settings for ingress traffic.
        - **Disable Dynamic NAT**: The above functionality is not applied.

5. Click **Attach a Private Network** to finish. You are taken back to the Private Networks tab, where the network you attached now appears, along with the services configured and the IP address of the Public Gateway.

Your Private Network is now attached to your Public Gateway. You can repeat the steps above to attach more Private Networks to the same Public Gateway if you wish.
