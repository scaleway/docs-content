## What is Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule?

Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule is a service that allows you to run containerized applications in a managed Kubernetes environment. 
Currently it is available in our **Paris (France)**, **Amsterdam (Netherlands)** and **Warsaw (Poland)** Availability Zones and supports at least the latest version of the last 3 major Kubernetes releases.

## How much am I billed for one cluster?

The price of the service will depend on the resources you allocate to your cluster, such as the number and type of nodes, the use of load balancers and persistent volumes.
Nodes are billed at the same price as the underlying Compute Instances.

The Kubernetes control plane is provided without additional costs.

## How much am I billed if I have enabled the auto-scaling feature?

If you enable auto-scaling, you will be able to define a minimum and a maximum number of machines that are available for your pool.

If the workload of your infrastructure is low, only the minimum number of machines will be running. If the load grows, additional machines are started automatically up to the maximum number of machines in the pool, to handle the workload on your application. If the load decreases, these additional machines will be stopped automatically.

## How can I have data persistence on my cluster?

Kapsule is a managed Kubernetes engine. By definition, the nodes of your clusters can be deleted, replaced, or restarted if the applications running on it require it or if a node suddenly stops responding. It means that Kubernetes clusters' nodes are to be considered stateless.
If you require a stateful application, you can use [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/).
The storageClass for Scaleway Block Storage volumes is set by default, so it does not need to be specified.
For more information, refer to the Kubernetes Kapsule product documentation on [GitHub](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-csi/tree/master/examples/kubernetes).

## Why cannot I connect to my nodes using SSH?

Kubernetes Kapsule manages your nodes. To ensure the behavior of your cluster, it is not possible to perform actions directly on the nodes. There is no need to connect to them directly, as all actions and configurations should be done using Kubernetes (from the Scaleway Console, `kubectl` command, or Scaleway Kapsule `APIs`).
