Learn how to configure a [flexible IP address](/compute/bare-metal-cloud/concepts/#flexible-ip) on your Bare Metal server. The configuration depends on the Linux distribution running on your machine. You can configure your flexible IP on machines running one of [Ubuntu Linux](#how-to-configure-a-flexible-ip-on-ubuntu-linux), [Debian Linux](#how-to-configure-a-flexible-ip-on-debian-linux) or [CentOS](#how-to-configure-a-flexible-ip-on-centos).

## How to configure a flexible IP on Ubuntu Linux

Since the LTS release of Ubuntu Version 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) the recommended way to configure a flexible IP is by using [Netplan](https://netplan.io/). If you prefer a more traditional configuration, refer to the instructions for [flexible IP configuration on Debian](#how-to-configure-a-flexible-ip-on-debian-linux).

1. Log into your server using SSH with a user having super-user rights.

2. Open the file `/etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml` with superuser rights in your favorite text editor and configure the networking for your machine.

   <Message type="note">

     IP addresses in the configuration file have to be specified in CIDR
     notation. The netmask is `/24` for the principal IP of the server and `/32`
     for each flexible IP.

   </Message>
   Your configuration file should look like the following example:

  ```
  network:
    version: 2
    renderer: networkd
    ethernets:
      enp1s0f0:
          addresses: [163.172.123.123/24, 212.83.123.123/32]
          gateway4: 163.172.123.1
        nameservers:
          addresses: [ "62.210.16.6", "62.210.16.7" ]
  ```

  <Message type="tip">

    The interface name for your primary interface may be different than
    `enp1s0f0`. You can use the `ip link show` command to determine the name of
    your public Internet interface.

  </Message>

3. Once the file is edited as required, save it and quit the text editor. Then apply
the configuration using the following command: 

  ```
  sudo netplan apply 
  ```

Your server now responds on both the primary IP address and the flexible IP address.

## How to configure a flexible IP on Debian Linux

1. Log into your server using SSH with a user having super-user rights.

2. Open the file `/etc/network/interfaces` with superuser rights in your favorite text editor and configure the networking for your machine.

3. Edit the file and add the flexible IP as shown in the following example:

  ```sh
  # This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
  # and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).
  # The loopback network interface
  auto lo
  iface lo inet loopback
  # The primary network interface
  auto eth0
  iface eth0 inet static
    	 address 195.154.123.123
  	   netmask 255.255.255.0
  	   gateway 195.154.123.1
  auto eth0:0
    iface eth0:0 inet static
       address ip_flexible
       netmask 255.255.255.255
  ```

  <Message type="note">

    The interface name of your server might be different depending on the hardware
    of the server. You can use the `ip link show` command to determine the name of
    your public Internet interface.

  </Message>

4. Save the file and quit the editor. 

5. Bring the interface up using the `ifup`
command: 
  ```sh 
  ifup eth0:0 
  ```

Your server now responds on both the primary IP address and the flexible IP address.

## How to configure a flexible IP on CentOS

1. Log into your server using SSH using the `root` user.

2. Copy the default network configuration file to create an alias:

  ```sh
  cp /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0:0
  ```

3. Open the file `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0:0` in your favourite text editor and modify it as in the following example:

  ```sh
  DEVICE="eth0:0"
  BOOTPROTO=static
  IPADDR="my_flexible_ip"
  NETMASK="255.255.255.255"
  ONBOOT=yes
  ```

4. Save the file, exit the text editor and run the following command to reload the network configuration:

  ```
  /etc/init.d/network restart
  ```
Your server now responds on both the primary IP address and the flexible IP address.
