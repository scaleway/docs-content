A **bucket policy** is a resource-based policy option. It allows you to grant more granular access to Object Storage resources.

By default, all Object Storage resources in a Project are private and can be accessed only by users or applications with [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission). Adding a bucket policy to a bucket allows you to specify who can perform which actions on a bucket and the objects it contains. You can combine the different [elements of a bucket policy](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/#bucket-policies-description) to tailor your permissions according to your use case.
