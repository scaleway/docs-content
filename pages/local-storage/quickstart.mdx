Scaleway Local Storage is a storage solution integrated directly into some of Scaleway's cloud Instances. The storage capacity varies by Instance type, with a maximum of 600 GB.
Local Storage is tied to the lifespan of the Instance; data stored locally will be lost if the Instance is terminated.
For persistent storage needs, Scaleway offers [Block Storage](/block-storage/), which provides scalable, network-attached storage that remains intact independently of the Instance's state.

## Console overview
Discover the Local Storage interface on the Scaleway console.

## How to attach a Local Storage volume

1. Click **Local Storage** in the **Storage** section of the Scaleway console side menu. Your Local Storage volumes display.
2. Click **Attach to Instance** next to the volume of your choice. A pop-up displays.

4. Click **Attach volume to Instance**.

<Message type="important">
  * You can attach up to 15 volumes at a time to a single Instance.
  * Local Storage resources are limited and bound to the characteristics of your Instance (vCPU/RAM). Alternatively, you can use [Block Storage](/block-storage/quickstart/) to increase the storage capacity of your Instance.
