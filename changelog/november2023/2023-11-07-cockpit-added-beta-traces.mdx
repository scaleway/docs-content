Along with metrics and logs, you can now push and pull traces from your Cockpit. Gain real-time insights and trace the heartbeat of your system with our new traces feature, based on Grafana Tempo.

Read [our documentation](/observability/cockpit/how-to/activate-push-traces/) to find out how to start using our traces feature.
