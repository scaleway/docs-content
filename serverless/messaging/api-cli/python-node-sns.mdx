AWS provides a number of **S**oftware **D**evelopment **K**its (SDKs) which provide language-specific APIs for AWS services, including [SNS](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#sns).

- AWS provides a dedicated [SDK for Go](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/).
- The [AWS SDK for Python](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/) is Boto3.
- For Node.js, use the [AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/), which can be [installed from NPM](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3#getting-started).

This page provides code samples to show you how to get started using these SDKs with Scaleway Messaging and Queuing SNS.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Activated SNS](/serverless/messaging/how-to/get-started/#how-to-activate-sqs-or-sns)
- Valid [credentials](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-credentials/) for SNS
- Installed the relevant AWS SDK [for Go](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/), [Python](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/) and/or [JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/)

## Go

### Connect to SNS (Go)

The following code shows you how to connect to SNS:

```go
import (
  "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws"
  "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/credentials"
  "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/session"
  "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/sns"
)

func main() {
  awsSession := session.Must(session.NewSession(&aws.Config{
    Region:   aws.String("fr-par"),
    Endpoint: aws.String("http://sns.mnq.fr-par.scaleway.com"),
    Credentials: credentials.NewStaticCredentials(AwsAccessKey, AwsSecretKey, ""),
  }))

  awsSns := sns.New(awsSession)

  [...]
}
```

<Message type="note">

  The `Endpoint` for Scaleway Messaging and Queuing with SNS is `https://sns.mnq.fr-par.scaleway.com`. The values for the access and secret keys should be the credentials you [generated](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-credentials/) for SNS.

</Message>

Once connected to the SNS service, you can use any of the SDK's available functions. Be aware though that some functions are not [supported by Scaleway Messaging and Queuing](/serverless/messaging/reference-content/sns-support/), so make sure to check the link for more details on these. See the [official SDK documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/sns) for more information on getting started with the SDK, or keep reading for some code examples.

### Create topic (Go)

```go
createTopicResponse, _ := awsSNS.CreateTopic(&sns.CreateTopicInput{
  Name: aws.String("my-test-topic"),
})
fmt.Println(*createTopicResponse.TopicArn)
```

### Publish messages to this topic (Go)

Be careful: messages sent to topics with no subscriptions are automatically deleted

```go
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
  _, _ = awsSNS.Publish(&sns.PublishInput{
    Message:  aws.String(fmt.Sprintf("Hello World: %d", i)),
    TopicArn: createTopicResponse.TopicArn,
  })
}
```

### Create subscriptions to this topic (Go)

#### Subscribe to an SQS queue from the same Scaleway Project

This is no longer supported. Watch this space for future developments.

#### Subscribe to a public Scaleway function

This code triggers the function each time a message is published to the topic.

You can find the value for `[Function URL]` in the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) in the **Endpoints** tab of your function's **Overview** page. 

```go
_, _ = awsSns.Subscribe(&sns.SubscribeInput{
  Endpoint: aws.String(FunctionUrl),
  Protocol: aws.String("lambda"),
  TopicArn: createTopicResponse.TopicArn,
})

Setting up an SQS queue from the same Scaleway Project (as a Dead Letter Queue), is no longer supported. Watch this space for future developments.

#### Subscribe to an HTTP/S endpoint

```go
_, _ = awsSns.Subscribe(&sns.SubscribeInput{
  Endpoint: aws.String(Url),
  Protocol: aws.String("http"), // or https
  TopicArn: createTopicResponse.TopicArn,
})
```

The HTTP server should receive an HTTP request with a body in json matching the following format:

```json
{
"Type": "SubscriptionConfirmation",
"Token": "<REDACTED-CONFIRMATION-TOKEN>",
"MessageId": "<REDACTED-MESSAGE-ID>",
"TopicArn": "arn:scw:sns:fr-par:<REDACTED-ID>:MyTopic",
"Message": "You have chosen to subscribe to the topic arn:scw:sns:fr-par:<REDACTED-ID>:MyTopic.\nTo confirm the subscription, visit the SubscribeURL included in this message.",
"Timestamp": "2022-06-29T10:03:34Z",
"SignatureVersion": "1",
"Signature": "<REDACTED-SIGNATURE>",
"SigningCertURL": "https://messaging.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/fr-par/sns/sns_certificate_[certSerialNumber].crt",
"SubscribeURL": "<THE-CONFIRMATION-LINK>" // Get the confirmation link located here
}
```

The signing certificate of the message is in the JSON of the `SigningCertURL`. This certificate is also signed by the [trust chain certificate](https://messaging.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/fr-par/sns/sns-trust-chain.pem) (common name `sns.mnq.srr.scw.cloud`). For more information about verifying the authenticity of the message, refer to the official [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-verify-signature-of-message.html).

To confirm the subscription, make a request to the `SubscribeURL` using your browser or curl.

### Delete all subscriptions (Go)

```go
listSubscriptions, _ := awsSns.ListSubscriptionsByTopic(&sns.ListSubscriptionsByTopicInput{
  TopicArn: createTopicResponse.TopicArn,
})
for _, sub := range listSubscriptions.Subscriptions {
  awsSns.Unsubscribe(&sns.UnsubscribeInput{
    SubscriptionArn: sub.SubscriptionArn,
  })
}
```

## Python

### Connect to SNS (Python)

The following code shows you how to connect to SNS using Boto3's `resource()`. You could also use `client()`, but we favor `resource()` as it is more pythonesque:

```python
sns = boto3.resource('sns',
  endpoint_url=[],
  aws_access_key_id=[],
  aws_secret_access_key=[],
  region_name='fr-par')
```

<Message type="note">
  The `endpoint_url` for Scaleway Messaging and Queuing with SNS is `https://sns.mnq.fr-par.scaleway.com`. The values for the access and secret keys should be the credentials you [generated](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-credentials/) for SNS.
</Message>

Once connected to the SNS service, you can use any of the SDK's available functions. However, some functions are not [supported by Scaleway Messaging and Queuing](/serverless/messaging/reference-content/sns-support/), so do check the link to make sure. See the [official SDK documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) for more information, or keep reading for some code examples.

### Create topic (Python)

```python
# Create a topic. This returns an SNS.Topic instance
topic = sns.create_topic(Name='test')  # You can now access identifiers and attributes
print(topic.arn)
print(topic.attributes)
```

### Publish messages to this topic (Python)

Be careful: messages sent to topics with no subscriptions are automatically deleted

```python
for i in range (0,10):
  topic.publish(Message="Hello World: "+str(i))
```

### Create subscriptions to this topic (Python)

#### Subscribe to an SQS queue from the same Scaleway Project

This is no longer supported. Watch this space for future developments.

#### Subscribe to a public Scaleway function

This code triggers the function each time a message is published to the topic.

You can find the value for `[Function URL]` in the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) in the **Endpoints** tab of your function's **Overview** page. 

```python
subscription_functions = topic.subscribe(
    Protocol='lambda',
    Endpoint=[Function URL],
    ReturnSubscriptionArn=True
)
```

Setting up an SQS queue from the same Scaleway Project (as a Dead Letter Queue), is no longer supported. Watch this space for future developments.

```python
subscription_functions = topic.subscribe(
    Protocol='lambda',
    Endpoint=[Function URL],
    ReturnSubscriptionArn=True,
    Attributes={
      'RedrivePolicy': '{"deadLetterTargetArn": "[Queue ARN]"}'
    }
)
```

#### Subscribe to an HTTP/S endpoint

```python
subscription = topic.subscribe(
    Protocol='http', //or https
    Endpoint=url,
    ReturnSubscriptionArn=True
)
```

The HTTP server should receive an HTTP request with a body in json matching the following format:

```json
{
"Type": "SubscriptionConfirmation",
"Token": "<REDACTED-CONFIRMATION-TOKEN>",
"MessageId": "<REDACTED-MESSAGE-ID>",
"TopicArn": "arn:scw:sns:fr-par:<REDACTED-ID>:MyTopic",
"Message": "You have chosen to subscribe to the topic arn:scw:sns:fr-par:<REDACTED-ID>:MyTopic.\nTo confirm the subscription, visit the SubscribeURL included in this message.",
"Timestamp": "2022-06-29T10:03:34Z",
"SignatureVersion": "1",
"Signature": "<REDACTED-SIGNATURE>",
"SigningCertURL": "http://<REDACTED-URL>/SNStest.crt",
"SubscribeURL": "<THE-CONFIRMATION-LINK>" // Get the confirmation link located here
}
```

To confirm the subscription, make a request to the `SubscribeURL` using your browser or curl.

### Delete all subscriptions (Python)

```python
for subs in topic.subscriptions.all():
    subs.delete()
```

## Node.js

### Connect to SNS (NodeJS)

The following code sample shows how to connect to SNS:

```javascript
import { 
    CreateTopicCommand,
    DeleteTopicCommand,
    ListSubscriptionsByTopicCommand,
    ListTopicsCommand,
    PublishCommand,
    SNSClient,
    SubscribeCommand,
    UnsubscribeCommand,
 } from "@aws-sdk/client-sns";

var snsClient = new SNSClient({
    credentials : {
        accessKeyId : "",
        secretAccessKey: ""
    },
    region: "par",
    endpoint: "https://sns.mnq.fr-par.scaleway.com",
    
})

```

<Message type="note">
  The `endpoint_url` for Scaleway Messaging and Queuing with SNS is `https://sns.mnq.fr-par.scaleway.com`. For the access and secret key values, use the credentials you [generated](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-credentials/) for SNS.
</Message>

Once connected to the SNS service, you can use any of the SDK's available functions. However, some functions are not [supported by Scaleway Messaging and Queuing](/serverless/messaging/reference-content/sns-support), so do check the link to make sure. See the [official SDK documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/clients/client-sns/) for more information, or keep reading for some code examples.

### Create topic (NodeJS)

You can find all available parameters for `createTopic` in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/clients/client-sns/classes/createtopiccommand.html).

```javascript
var paramsTopic = {
    Name: 'MyTopic'
  };
const commandCreateTopic = new CreateTopicCommand(paramsTopic);
const restCreateTopic = await snsClient.send(commandCreateTopic);
const topicARN= restCreateTopic.TopicArn;
console.log(topicARN);
```

### Publish messages to this topic (NodeJS)

Be careful: messages sent to topics with no subscriptions are automatically deleted.

This code sample demonstrates how to send a message with `MessageAttributes`. For more information on MessageAttributes, refer to [the official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/clients/client-sns/classes/publishcommand.html).

```javascript
var paramsSend = {
    Message: 'MyMessage', 
    Subject: 'MySubject',
    TopicArn: topicARN,
  };
const commandPublishCommand = new PublishCommand(paramsSend);
const restPublishCommand = await snsClient.send(commandPublishCommand);
console.log(restPublishCommand.MessageId);
```

### Subscribe to a topic (NodeJS)

You can find all available parameters for the subscribe operation in the [AWS documentation] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/clients/client-sns/classes/subscribecommand.html)

#### Subscribe to an SQS queue from the same Scaleway Project

This is no longer supported. Watch this space for future developments.

#### Subscribe to a public Scaleway function

This code triggers the function each time a message is published to the topic.

You can find the value for `[Function URL]` in the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) in the **Endpoints** tab of your function's **Overview** page. 

```javascript
var params = {
    Protocol: 'lambda', 
    TopicArn: topicARN, 
    Endpoint: 'YOUR FUNCTION ENDPOINT',
    ReturnSubscriptionArn: true 
  };
const command = new SubscribeCommand(params);
const rest = await snsClient.send(command);
console.log(rest.SubscriptionArn);
```

Setting up an SQS queue from the same Scaleway Project (as a Dead Letter Queue), is no longer supported. Watch this space for future developments.

#### Subscribe to an HTTP/S endpoint

```javascript
var paramsHttpsSubscription = {
    Protocol: 'https', 
    TopicArn: topicARN, 
    Endpoint: 'YOUR SERVER ENDPOINT',
    ReturnSubscriptionArn: true 
  };
const commandHttpsSubscription = new SubscribeCommand(paramsHttpsSubscription);
const restHttpsSubscription = await snsClient.send(commandHttpsSubscription);
console.log(restHttpsSubscription.SubscriptionArn);

```
The HTTP server receives an HTTP request with a `json` body matching the following format:

```json
{
"Type": "SubscriptionConfirmation",
"Token": "<REDACTED-CONFIRMATION-TOKEN>",
"MessageId": "<REDACTED-MESSAGE-ID>",
"TopicArn": "arn:scw:sns:fr-par:<REDACTED-ID>:MyTopic",
"Message": "You have chosen to subscribe to the topic arn:scw:sns:fr-par:<REDACTED-ID>:MyTopic.\nTo confirm the subscription, visit the SubscribeURL included in this message.",
"Timestamp": "2022-06-29T10:03:34Z",
"SignatureVersion": "1",
"Signature": "<REDACTED-SIGNATURE>",
"SigningCertURL": "http://<REDACTED-URL>/SNStest.crt",
"SubscribeURL": "<THE-CONFIRMATION-LINK>" // Get the confirmation link located here
}
```

To confirm the subscription, make a request to the `SubscribeURL` using your browser or curl.

### Delete all subscriptions (NodeJS)

The following code sample deletes all subscriptions to a topic.

```javascript
var paramsListSubs = {
    TopicArn: topicARN, 
  };
const commandListSubs = new ListSubscriptionsByTopicCommand(paramsListSubs);
const restListSubs = await snsClient.send(commandListSubs);
const subscriptionsList = restListSubs.Subscriptions;
subscriptionsList.forEach(async function (element) {
try {
    var params = {
        SubscriptionArn: element.SubscriptionArn 
      };
      const command = new UnsubscribeCommand(params)
      const rest = await snsClient.send(command)
      console.log("Unsubscribing : ",rest.$metadata.httpStatusCode)

} catch (e) {
  throw new Error(e.message)
}
});

```

### Delete all topics (NodeJS)

The following code sample deletes all your SNS topics.

```javascript
// First List Topics
const commandList = new ListTopicsCommand({});
const restTopicList = await snsClient.send(commandList);
const TopicList = restTopicList.Topics

// For Each Topic in the list, apply the Delete Topic Command
TopicList.forEach(async function (element) {
    try {
        var params = {
            TopicArn: element.TopicArn 
          };
          const command = new DeleteTopicCommand(params)
          const rest = await snsClient.send(command)
          console.log("Deleting : ",rest.$metadata.httpStatusCode)
    
    } catch (e) {
      throw new Error(e.message)
    }
    });

```
