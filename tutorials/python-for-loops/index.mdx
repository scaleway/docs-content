If you're coming to this tutorial as a complete Python beginner, make sure you're familiar with the Python concepts covered in our [Python for complete beginners](/tutorials/get-started-python/) tutorial, and with [dictionaries and lists](/docs/tutorials/python-lists-dicts/).

## Introduction

So you know how to **create variables** in Python (`my_variable = 3`), as well as how to **create lists** (`my_list = [3, 5, 9, 6]`) and **dictionaries** (`my_dict = {"Sara": 3 "Aneesa": 5, "Emmanuel": 9, "Tom": 6}`) to store multiple items in a single variable? Then you're ready to learn about **loops**.

A **loop** is a piece of code that tells Python to repeat a specified set of actions multiple times. Loops are a fundamental part of most programming languages, and let you achieve a whole lot with just a few lines of code. Often, they **iterate** over collections of data (such as data held in dictionaries or lists) and carry out all sorts of operations on those collections.

Why are loops useful? Let's look at a quick example:

Imagine you have a list of numbers, and you want to find every number higher than 10. Without a loop, the code is very long and repetitive:

```python
my_list = [3, 10.1, 62, 9]

if my_list[0] > 10:
  print(my_list[0])

if my_list[1] > 10:
  print(my_list[1])

if my_list[2] > 10:
  print(my_list[2])

if my_list[3] > 10:
  print(my_list[3])
```

Output:
```python
10.1
62
```

With a for loop, we can do it in just three lines of code:

```python
for number in my_list:
  if number > 10:
    print(number)
```

Output:
```python
10.1
62
```

Let's dive into the world of for loops in python, and learn how to code them and what we can do with them.

<Message type="note">
There are two types of loop in Python: **while** loops (the loop repeats while a certain condition is true and exits once the condition is false) and **for** loops (the loop iterates over a sequence or collection of data and exits when it reaches the end of the sequence/collection). 

|  | For loop | While loop |
|---|---|---|
| Syntax | ```for element in sequence:```<br />```  do this``` | ```while condition:```<br />```  do this``` |

This tutorial concerns only **for** loops.
