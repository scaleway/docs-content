This page shows how to create your first [Mac mini M1](/compute/apple-silicon/concepts#mac-mini-m1) with the Scaleway console.

<Message type="requirement">

Due to license constraints, the minimum lease for Apple silicon is 24 hours. As a result, a Mac mini M1 can only be deleted after 24 hours have passed from when you initiated the lease.
