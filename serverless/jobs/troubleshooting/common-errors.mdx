## Job run is in an error state

### Possible solutions

- Make sure you built your image for an `amd64` architecture, as `arm64` is not supported. See [Architecture](/serverless/jobs/reference-content/jobs-limitations/#Architecture) documentation.

- Make sure your deployment does not exceed the limitations of [Serverless Jobs](/serverless/jobs/reference-content/jobs-limitations/).

## Issues when retrieving an external image

### Cause

Serverless products support external public registries (such as [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)), but we do not recommend using them due to uncontrolled rate limiting, which can lead to failures when starting resources, unexpected usage conditions, and pricing changes.

### Solution

We recommend using [Scaleway's Container Registry](/containers/container-registry/) instead, as it allows for a seamless integration with Serverless Containers and Jobs at a [competitive price](/faq/containerregistry/#how-am-i-billed-for-scaleway-container-registry).
