In this quickstart, we show you how to start using [Audit Trail](/identity-and-access-management/audit-trail/concepts/#audit-trail).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created [resources integrated with Audit Trail](/identity-and-access-management/audit-trail/reference-content/resource-integration-with-adt/)

## How to configure the Audit Trail permission set

To start using Audit Trail you need to configure permission sets in [IAM](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#iam).

Refer to the [dedicated documentation page](/identity-and-access-management/audit-trail/how-to/configure-audit-trail-permissions/) to find out how.

## How to use Audit Trail

1. Click **Audit Trail** in the **Security and Identity** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu.
2. Click the **Region** drop-down and select a region in which you have created resources integrated with Audit Trail. Your Audit Trail events display.

    <Message type="tip">
     If no events display after you use the filter, try switching the region from the **Region** drop-down, or adjusting your search. Find out how to troubleshoot event issues in our [dedicated documentation](/identity-and-access-management/audit-trail/troubleshooting/cannot-see-events).
