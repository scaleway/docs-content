The creation and management of TLS certificates is included in the Managed Database for PostgreSQL offers.

A certificate is generated automatically upon the creation of a Database Instance.

You can renew your certificates at any time. This allows you to renew your certificates whenever you add a new endpoint, for example.

PostgreSQL natively supports SSL connections that enhance the security of client/server communications with TLS protocols. PostgreSQL does not, however, verify server certificates by default.

In this page we show you how to verify if your connection is correctly encrypted and if the encryption key matches that of your Database Instance.
