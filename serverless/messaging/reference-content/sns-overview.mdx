## What is SNS?

SNS is a managed messaging service developed by AWS and supported by Scaleway Messaging and Queuing. It is often coupled to work with [SQS](/serverless/messaging/reference-content/sqs-overview/).

SNS (Simple Notification Service) was released in 2010. It enables users to interconnect their applications and systems using a [publish/subscribe](/serverless/messaging/concepts#publishsubscribe) pattern. Many publishers can send messages to [topics](/serverless/messaging/concepts#topicexchange), while consumers, e.g. applications, can subscribe to topics to receive all (or a subset) of messages sent to this topic. Scaleway Messaging and Queuing makes it easy to migrate your SNS-connected applications by providing a dedicated protocol gateway. 

<Message type="note">
  Some SNS features are not yet available with Scaleway Messaging and Queuing. Supported subscribers are currently limited to:
    - HTTP/S clients
    - [Serverless Functions](https://www.scaleway.com/en/serverless-functions/)
    - SQS queues in the same [Project](/console/my-project/concepts/#project)

  Refer to the [developers documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/messaging-and-queuing/) for more information.

## Activating SNS

Before you can start using SNS with Scaleway Messaging and Queuing, you must first activate it. You can do this in a few clicks from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) by [following our how-to](/serverless/messaging/how-to/get-started/). Alternatively, you can also use the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/messaging-and-queuing/).

## SNS Credentials

Once you have activated SNS, the next step is to [create credentials](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-credentials) that give your applications permission to connect to the Scaleway Messaging and Queuing service.

Credentials are scoped to your SQS service at [Project](/console/my-project/concepts/#project)-level. You can choose to give each set of credentials the required level of permissions:

  - **Read**: receive messages from queues and topics.
  - **Write**: send messages to queues and publish in topics.
  - **Manage**: create or edit resources (such as queues and topics).

## Further actions

All further actions including creating, listing and managing topics, sending messages etc. can be done using the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs. Check out our documentation to help you get started with the [AWS CLI](/serverless/messaging/api-cli/connect-aws-cli/) or [AWS SDKs](/serverless/messaging/api-cli/python-node-sqs/).
