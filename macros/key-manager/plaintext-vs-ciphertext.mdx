<Concept>
 ## What is the difference between ciphertext and plaintext?
 **Ciphertext** refers to data that has been encrypted using a cryptographic algorithm and a key.
  Ciphertext can be encrypted on the client side as long as the encryption key used for encryption is safely stored (in a Key Manager, for example).
  Unlike plaintext, ciphertext is not human-readable and cannot be understood or used without first decrypting it with the appropriate decryption key.

 **Plaintext** refers to unencrypted, readable data. In the context of key management, plaintext often refers to cryptographic keys or sensitive data that are stored or transmitted in an unencrypted form. This term is often used in contrast to ciphertext, which is data that has been encrypted and is not readable without decryption.
