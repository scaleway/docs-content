During deployment, each Instance gets a private IP from its hosting node, besides its public IP that is routed to the Instance through a carrier-grate NAT solution. However, if the underlying hypervisor changes, the private IP changes. This can happen when you restart your Instance. This private network lets Instances communicate without public IPs. 

Routing a public IP directly to an Instance bypasses private IPs, sending traffic to its routed flexible IP. The benefit is the IP stays consistent even if the Instance is restarted or moved. Routed IP also lets you assign multiple flexible IPv4s and IPv6s to an Instance, supporting both IPv4 and IPv6.

<Message type="important">
  * The routed IP feature **is not compatible** with legacy Instance types such as STARDUST and VC-XX.
  * Using static network configurations during migration can lead to a loss of Internet connectivity (using DHCP is advised).
  * You must update the `scw` and `cloud-init` packages before starting migration.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) that is not migrated to routed IPs

1. Select **Instances** from the **Compute** category in the sidebar menu. This will show a list of your Instances. Those eligible for migration can be identified by an exclamation mark icon.

2. Click **Migrate** next to the Instance you wish to migrate to routed flexible IPs. A pop-up displays.
    <Message type="tip">
      Alternatively, you can initiate the migration from your Instance's overview page by clicking the **Migrate** button.
    </Message>
3. Enter **MIGRATE** to confirm your intent and click **Migrate Instance**. This will initiate the migration process, and your Instance will undergo a reboot.
    <Message type="note">
      Post-migration, your Instance will retain its public IP address, but its private IP will be removed.
    </Message>
After the migration finishes, the notification icon will no longer be visible in your Instances list.

  For detailed guidance on using the routed flexible IP feature via the Scaleway API or CLI tool, refer to our dedicated documentation [Routing public IPs to Instances using the Scaleway API](/compute/instances/api-cli/using-routed-ips/).
