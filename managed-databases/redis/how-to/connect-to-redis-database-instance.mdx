You can connect to your Redis™ Database Instance using the [Redis™ CLI](https://redis.io/docs/ui/cli/).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [Redis™ Database Instance](/managed-databases/redis/how-to/create-a-database-for-redis)

1. Click **Redis™** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Redis™ Database Instances displays.
2. Click the Database Instance name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Retrieve the Database Instance IP and port from the Database Instance information section.
    <Message type="note">
    Alternatively, you can click the **copy icon** under **Connection** to retrieve the Redis™ CLI connection command. This already includes an IP and port.
    </Message>

    <Message type="important">
    You can use only one of your node IP addresses at a time to connect to your Redis™ Database Instance, as the Redis™ CLI does not support cluster mode.
    </Message>
4. Run the following command to connect to your Redis™ Database Instance.
    <Message type="note">
    In this tutorial we will use 192.0.2.1 and 6379 as the example IP and port, respectively.
    </Message>

    ```
    redis-cli -h 192.0.2.1 -p 6379 --user <redis-user> --askpass --tls --cacert SSL_<redis-cluster-name>.pem
    ```

    <Message type="note">
    The command above uses TLS to add an extra layer of security to your connection. The TLS certificate is generated automatically if you set tls_enabled to true. The certificates take on the following name structure: `SSL_redis-<name-of-your-redis-database-instance>.pem`. When using connectors other than redis-cli, you might need to specify the path to your certificate.
    </Message>

    <Message type="important">
    Scaleway supports TLS1.2 and TLS1.3. If you use older versions of [`libssl`](https://cppget.org/libssl/), you might encounter connection issues when using redis-cli. If this is the case, we recommend you check the `libssl` versions installed on your local machine and update if necessary.

5. Enter the password that you defined upon database creation.

You are now connected to your Managed Database for Redis™.
