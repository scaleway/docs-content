## Proxmox - Overview

Proxmox Virtual Environment (Proxmox VE) is a open-source management platform for virtual machines, based on Debian Linux. It integrates both, [Linux Kernel Virtual Machines (KVM)](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page) as well as [LXC containers](https://linuxcontainers.org/). KVM provides full virtualization for complete Windows and Linux images whilst LXC containers are lightweight and perfect to run conflict-free Linux applications. [Proxmox Virtual Environment](https://www.proxmox.com/en/) is an alternative hypervisor to [VMWare ESXi](/tutorials/configure-virtual-machine-esxi/) or [Microsoft HyperV](/tutorials/configure-vm-hyperv/). You can easily host Virtual Machines (VM) on a dedicated server.

The software provides an intuitive web interface as well as a complete REST-API to deploy and manage infrastructures.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net)
  - You have a [Scaleway Dedibox](http://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox)
  - You have at least one [failover IP](/dedibox-network/ip-failover/concepts/#failover-ips) with a [virtual MAC address](/dedibox-network/ip-failover/concepts/#virtual-mac-address)
</Message>

<Message type="note">
  This tutorial assumes that you have already installed Proxmox VE on your Scaleway Dedibox. The automatic installation of Proxmox VE is available from your [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net) 
  or manually unsing the [KVM-over-IP device](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/concepts/#ipmi) of your server.

## Connecting to Proxmox

1. Open a web browser on your computer and go to the Proxmox web interface, available at `https://your_dedibox_ip:8006/`
2. Log into the web interface with the `root` user and the password you have set during the installation of Proxmox.
3. The Proxmox dashboard displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_dashboard.webp" width="800" alt="" />

## Proxmox image store

### Downloading LXC container images

LXC uses pre-built containers. Proxmox provides a selection of the most common containers for download directly from their servers. Before creating a container, an image needs to be downloaded onto the Proxmox host.

1. Click **Storage** > **local** to enter the local storage.
2. Click **Templates** to download an image from Proxmox:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_templates.webp" width="800" alt="" />
3. Choose the image to download and click **Download**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_templates_dl.webp" width="800" alt="" />

### Uploading ISO-files

KVM uses a virtual CD-ROM drive to boot the OS installation system from an ISO file.
ISO files are archive files that contain identical copies of the data found on optical discs. To create a KVM virtual machine, an installation media has to be uploaded first.

1. Click **Storage** > **local** to enter the local storage.
2. Click **Upload** to upload an ISO file from your local computer:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_iso_upload.webp" width="600" alt="" />
3. Choose a local file and upload it to the Proxmox server:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_kvm_upload_iso.webp" width="250" alt="" />

## Deploying a virtual machine

### Creating a LXC container

1. Click **Create CT** to launch the LXC container creation wizard:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_create_ct.webp" width="800" alt="" />
2. Enter the **Hostname** for the container, a **Password** and its confirmation. Optionally you can enter or upload a public SSH key for authentication:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_ct_general_01.webp" width="500" alt="" />
3. Choose the template for the LXC container:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_ct_template_02.webp" width="500" alt="" />
4. Configure the virtual disk for the cluster. You can set the type of the storage as well as the capacity of the virtual disk:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_ct_disk_03.webp" width="500" alt="" />
5. Set the number of virtual CPU cores available for the container:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_ct_cpu_04.webp" width="500" alt="" />
6. Set the amount of available RAM and Swap space for the container towards your requirements:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_ct_ram_05.webp" width="500" alt="" />
7. Configure the network for the container. Set the parameters as follows to ensure your container has network access:
    - **Name**: Set this value to `eth0`
    - **MAC Address**: Set this value to the [virtual MAC address](/dedibox-network/ip-failover/concepts/#virtual-mac-address) associated to the failover IP of the container.
    - **Bridge**: Set this value to `vmbr0`.
    - **IPv4**: Configure the IPv4 of the container as `Static`, enter the failover IP in [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation) and configure the unique gateway `62.210.0.1`.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_ct_eth_06.webp" width="500" alt="" />
8. Set the resolving DNS servers for the container. You can either configure the DNS servers provided by Scaleway Dedibox (`62.210.16.6` and `62.210.16.7`) or set your preferred DNS resolvers:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_ct_dns_07.webp" width="500" alt="" />
9. A summary of the containers' configuration displays. If everything is set correctly, click **Finish** to create the container:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_ct_summary_08.webp" width="500" alt="" />
10. Start the container from the Proxmox web interface. You can use the web console to connect to your virtual machine and test the network connectivity using a `ping`-test:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_ct_ping_09.webp" width="800" alt="" />

### Creating a KVM virtual machine

1. Click **Create VM** to launch the KVM virtual machine creation wizard:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_kvm_create.webp" width="800" alt="" />
2. Enter a **Name** for the virtual machine. The **Node** and **VM ID** values are pre-filled, leave them as they are.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_kvm_create_01.webp" width="500" alt="" />
3. Choose the installation media for the virtual machine. Select **CD/DVD disc image file (iso)**, choose the **local** storage and select the ISO-file downloaded previously. Choose the **Guest OS** type. For a recent Linux distribution, select **Type** `Linux` and **Version** `5.x - 2.6 Kernel`. For other OS types set the values according to the requirements of your operating system.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_kvm_os_02.webp" width="500" alt="" />
4. Configure graphics card and SCSI controller available for the virtual machine. If no special requirements are needed, leave the default settings:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_kvm_system_03.webp" width="500" alt="" />
5. Set the parameters of the virtual hard drive. You can go with the default settings and set the disk size towards your requirements:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_kvm_hdd_04.webp" width="500" alt="" />
6. Choose the CPU settings for the virtual machine. You may set the number of **Sockets** and **Cores** as well as the **Type** towards your requirements:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_kvm_cpu_05.webp" width="500" alt="" />
7. Set the amount of RAM for the virtual machine towards your requirements
8. Configure the network interface. Set the **bridge** to `vmbr0`, the model to `VirtIO (paravirtualized)` and configure the [virtual MAC address](/dedibox-network/ip-failover/concepts/#virtual-mac-address) assigned to the failover IP of the virtual machine. The static [network configuration](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/configure-flexible-ip/) is done in a later step, during the installation of the operating system.  <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_kvm_cpu_05.webp" width="500" alt="" />
9. A configuration summary displays. Click **Finish** if all settings are correct to launch the creation of the virtual machine.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_kvm_summary_08.webp" width="500" alt="" />
10. Start the virtual machine from the Proxmox panel. It boots from the chosen ISO file. Connect to the virtual machine using the console and follow the steps of the operating systems' setup wizard to complete the installation:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox_kvm_install_09.webp" width="800" alt="" />
