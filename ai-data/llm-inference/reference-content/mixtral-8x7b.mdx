## How to use it

### Sending Inference requests

To perform inference tasks with your LLM model deployed at Scaleway, use the following command:

```bash
curl -s \
-H "X-Auth-Token: <IAM token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--request POST \
--url "https://<Deployment UUID>.ifr.fr-par.scw.cloud/" \
--data '{"text_input": "What are the steps to create a D&D character?", "max_tokens": 200, "bad_words": [], "stop_words": []}'
```

<Message type="note">
  Ensure that the input data is properly formatted according to the model's input requirements.
</Message>

### Receiving Inference responses

Upon sending the HTTP request to the public or private endpoints exposed by the server, you will receive inference responses from the managed Inference server. 
Process the output data according to your application's needs. The response will contain the output generated by the LLM model based on the input provided in the request.
