By default, the SMTP ports (25, 465, 587) for outgoing emails on your Elastic Metal server are closed and cannot be reached from our infrastructure.

If you want to send emails from your server, you can enable SMTP for each Availability Zone from the console.

<Macro id="requirements" />
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or appropriate [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) for actions in the intended Organization
- An [installed Elastic Metal server](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/quickstart/#how-to-create-an-elastic-metal-server)
- [Verified your identity](/console/account/how-to/verify-identity/)
