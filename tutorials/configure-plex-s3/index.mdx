Plex is a client/server media player system comprising two main components:

- The **Plex Server** application, which is available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and even some NAS devices.
- **Plex clients** that can be either a web-based interface, an application on smart TVs, streaming boxes, or other third-party applications.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An [Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (or later)
- An [Object Storage bucket](/object-storage/how-to/create-a-bucket/)
- `sudo` privileges or access to the root user

## Installing the required software

1. Connect to your Instance using SSH:
    ```bash
    ssh root@<your-instance-IP>
    ```
2. Update the APT package manager and the software already installed on the system:
    ```bash
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
3. Add the Plex repository:

    Add Plex's GPG key and create a new repository file:
    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
    curl -fsSL https://downloads.plex.tv/plex-keys/PlexSign.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/plex.gpg
    echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/plex.gpg] https://downloads.plex.tv/repo/deb public main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/plexmediaserver.list
    ```
4. Install Plex and s3fs:

    Update the APT package list and install the latest version of Plex and s3fs:
    ```bash
    apt update
    apt install -y plexmediaserver s3fs
    ```

### Configuring s3fs

1. Create the folder on which you will mount the bucket:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p /mnt/media
    ```
2. Obtain and configure API keys for Scaleway Object Storage:

    - Log in to your [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) and navigate to Object Storage.
    - Select or create a bucket.
    - [Create an API](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) key with `ObjectStorageFullAccess` permission.

3. Enter your API keys in the password file and set proper permissions:
    ```bash
    echo ACCESS_KEY_ID:SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | sudo tee /etc/passwd-s3fs
    sudo chmod 600 /etc/passwd-s3fs
    ```
4. Uncomment `user_allow_other` in the `/etc/fuse.conf` file:
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/fuse.conf
      [...]
      user_allow_other
    ```
5. Mount the bucket in the local file system:
    ```bash
    sudo s3fs BUCKET_NAME /mnt/media -o allow_other -o umask=0002 -o passwd_file=/etc/passwd-s3fs -o url=https://s3.REGION.scw.cloud
    ```
    <Message type="note">
      Replace `BUCKET_NAME` with the name of your bucket and `REGION` with its appropriate code (e.g., `nl-ams`).
    </Message>
6. (Optional) Enable automatic mounting at boot by adding an entry to `/etc/fstab`:
    ```bash
    echo "s3fs#BUCKET_NAME /mnt/media fuse _netdev,allow_other,umask=0002,passwd_file=/etc/passwd-s3fs,url=https://s3.REGION.scw.cloud 0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
    ```

### Configuring Plex

1. Check that Plex is running:
    ```bash
    systemctl status plexmediaserver.service
    ```
    If the status is `active (running)`, everything is fine.
2. Access the Plex interface through an SSH tunnel:
    - On Linux/macOS:
      ```bash
      ssh root@plex.server.ip -L 8888:localhost:32400
      ```
    - On Windows (using PuTTY):
      - Open PuTTY, enter your server IP, and navigate to **Connection > SSH > Tunnels**.
      - Set **Source port** to `8888` and **Destination** to `localhost:32400`.
      - Click **Add**, then **Save**, then **Open** to connect.

    Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:8888/web` to access Plex.
    <Message type="note">
      A Plex account is required.
    </Message>
3. Configure the Plex server:
    - Open `http://<plex.server.ip>:32400` in a browser.
    - Complete the setup wizard.
    - Add a library and specify `/mnt/media/<Folder Name>` as the media folder.

4. To upload media, use an S3-compatible tool like Cyberduck.
5. Trigger a media scan in Plex to display new files.
