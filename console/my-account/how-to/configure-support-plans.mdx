Although all roles can open support tickets, only an Owner can alter the Organization's [support plan](/console/my-account/concepts/#support-plan/). 

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) 

</Message>

The default support plan for an Organization is the **Basic** plan, but it can be upgraded on the **Support Plan** tab of the Organization page:

- Select a plan and click **Choose this plan** to proceed. A pop-up displays with a disclaimer message informing you that your payment will be made automatically on the current month's invoice. Make sure you have carefully read the message.
- Click **I understand** to confirm the change.

An overview of your previous and current plans is available under **Support Plans History**.
