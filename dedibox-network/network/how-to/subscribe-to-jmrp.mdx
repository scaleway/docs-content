Subscribing to the Junk Mail Reporting Program (JMRP) allows you to register your IP addresses with Microsoft's mail delivery system. This registration helps you proactively manage your IP reputation by enabling you to take appropriate actions if your IP is flagged as a source of spam, thus reducing the risk of blacklisting.

By default, the IP ownerâ€™s information (e.g., Scaleway/Online.net) is used to identify the association of an email address with a specific IP. However, if you have [properly configured the reverse DNS for your IP](/dedibox-network/ip-failover/how-to/configure-reverse-dns/), you can use an email address from your own domain for these notifications.

Following these steps will help you maintain a clean email delivery system and protect your IP reputation.
