Moodle is an open source **L**earning **M**anagement **S**ystem (LMS) that provides educators and students with a platform and various tools to create and participate in collaborative online learning environments.

This tutorial shows you how to create your own learning platform by installing Moodle on an Instance using a LEMP-Stack (Ubuntu Linux, Nginx, MariaDB, and PHP).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An [Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance) running on Ubuntu Focal Fossa (20.04 LTS)
- A [domain or subdomain](/network/domains-and-dns/quickstart/) pointed to your Instance

## Installing and configuring the LEMP stack

Software-wise, Moodle requires:

- A web server
- PHP (as it is PHP-based)
- A database server

During this tutorial we install and configure a [LEMP-Stack](https://lemp.io/) using [Nginx](https://nginx.org/), [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) and [PHP](https://www.php.net/).

1. Update the systems `apt` repository information and upgrade it to make sure that the system is up-to-date and has the latest bug-fixes and updates installed.
    ```
    apt update && apt -y upgrade
    ```
2. Use Ubuntu's APT package manager to install the stack packages:
    ```
    apt install nginx mariadb-server mariadb-client php-fpm php-common php-mysql php-gmp php-curl php-intl php-mbstring php-soap php-xmlrpc php-gd php-xml php-cli php-zip
    ```

### Setting up MariaDB

1. Define a root password for the database server (if not previously set) by running the command:
    ```
    mysql_secure_installation
    ```
2. Answer the questions when prompted, as such:
    ```
    NOTE: RUNNING ALL PARTS OF THIS SCRIPT IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL MariaDB
          SERVERS IN PRODUCTION USE!  PLEASE READ EACH STEP CAREFULLY!

    In order to log into MariaDB to secure it, we'll need the current
    password for the root user.  If you've just installed MariaDB, and
    you haven't set the root password yet, the password will be blank,
    so you should just press enter here.

    Enter current password for root (enter for none):
    ```

    Press enter.

    ```
    OK, successfully used password, moving on...

    Setting the root password ensures that nobody can log into the MariaDB
    root user without the proper authorisation.

    Set root password? [Y/n]
    ```

    Answer with `y`. Type in your new password, press enter and re-enter it.

    ```
    New password:
    Re-enter new password:
    Password updated successfully!
    Reloading privilege tables..
    ... Success!
    ```

    Answer the next four prompts with `y`

    ```
    By default, a MariaDB installation has an anonymous user, allowing anyone
    to log into MariaDB without having to have a user account created for
    them.  This is intended only for testing, and to make the installation
    go a bit smoother.  You should remove them before moving into a
    production environment.

    Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] y
    ... Success!

    Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from 'localhost'.  This
    ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network.

    Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] y
    ... Success!

    By default, MariaDB comes with a database named 'test' that anyone can
    access.  This is also intended only for testing, and should be removed
    before moving into a production environment.

    Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] y
    - Dropping test database...
    ... Success!
    - Removing privileges on test database...
    ... Success!

    Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes made so far
    will take effect immediately.

    Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] y
    ... Success!

    Cleaning up...

    All done!  If you've completed all of the above steps, your MariaDB
    installation should now be secure.

    Thanks for using MariaDB!
    ```
3. Run the command to verify if the installation was successfully completed:
    ```
    mysql -u root -p
    ```

    When prompted, insert root password. If the installation was successful, you will see the MariaDB welcome message. Type `exit` to leave the MariaDB prompt.

    Some settings need to be added to the MariaDB default configuration file to ensure Moodle is properly installed later on.
4. Open the file using your text editor of choice. (In this tutorial we will use `nano`)
    ```
    nano /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf
    ```

    And add the following lines to the end of the **Basic Settings** section.

      ```
      innodb_file_format = Barracuda
      innodb_file_per_table = 1
      innodb_large_prefix = ON
      ```

    Like so:
    ```
    #
    # * Basic Settings
    #
    user                    = mysql
    pid-file                = /run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
    socket                  = /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
    #port                   = 3306
    basedir                 = /usr
    datadir                 = /var/lib/mysql
    tmpdir                  = /tmp
    lc-messages-dir         = /usr/share/mysql
    #skip-external-locking
    innodb_file_format = Barracuda
    innodb_file_per_table = 1
    innodb_large_prefix = ON
    ```
5. Restart MariaDB:
    ```
    systemctl restart mariadb.service
    ```

### Setting up PHP

To ensure better performance, [Moodle recommends](https://docs.moodle.org/39/en/PHP#PHP_Settings) checking and editing some default PHP settings.

1. Open `php.ini` with your preferred text editor:
    ```
    nano /etc/php//fpm/php.ini
    ```
2. Edit according to these guidelines:
    ```
    memory_limit = 128M (Larger systems will require a higher setting)
    session.save_handler = files
    file_uploads = On
    session.auto_start = 0
    allow_url_fopen = On
    short_open_tag = On
    cgi.fix_pathinfo = 0
    upload_max_filesize =  128M (set to the maximum file size that can be uploaded)
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      For settings which use ON/OFF as their values, you can substitute 1 for ON and 0 for OFF if you prefer.
    </Message>

## Creating a database

1. Log in to MariaDB by running the command below and enter the previously set password when prompted.
    ```
    mysql -u root -p
    ```
2. Run the following command to create a database called `moodle`:
    ```
    CREATE DATABASE moodle;
    ```
3. Create a user called `moodleuser` and define a password for the database replacing `insert_password` by your password of choice.
    ```
    CREATE USER 'moodleuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'insert_password';
    ```
4. Grant the user full access to the database.
    ```
    GRANT ALL ON moodle.* TO 'moodleuser'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
    ```
5.  Save and exit.
    ```
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    EXIT;
    ```

## Installing Moodle

We will use `git`and `curl` to access and clone the latest version of Moodle.

1. Install the packages, then change directory to Nginx root.
    ```
    apt install git curl
    cd /var/www/
    ```
2. Check the most recent version of Moodle on [this list](https://github.com/moodle/moodle/branches) of each branch available

    And replace `#` with the corresponding branch number before downloading the Moodle packages.

    ```
    git clone -b MOODLE_#_STABLE git://git.moodle.org/moodle.git moodle
    ```
3. Configure permissions by running the following commands:
    ```
    mkdir -p /var/www/moodledata
    chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/
    chmod -R 755 /var/www/
    chown www-data:www-data /var/www/moodledata
    ```

## Configuring the web server

1. Use a text editor to create a new server block VirtualHost file named `moodle` under the `/etc/nginx/sites-available` directory to include the client request settings of your web server.
    ```
    nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/moodle
    ```

    Copy and paste the configuration below into the file. Replace `example.com` with your domain name and save.
    ```
    server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;
        root /var/www/moodle;
        index  index.php index.html index.htm;
        server_name  example.com www.example.com;

        client_max_body_size 100M;
        autoindex off;
        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }

        location /dataroot/ {
          internal;
          alias /var/www/moodledata/;
        }

        location ~ [^/].php(/|$) {
            include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
            fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php-fpm.sock;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
            include fastcgi_params;
        }
    }
    ```
2. Create a symbolic link to enable the server block and restart Nginx.
    ```
    ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/moodle /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
    systemctl restart nginx.service
    ```

    You can check if Moodle is accessible via a web interface by accessing `http://localhost` using the server's IP or your domain.

## Configuring SSL with Let's Encrypt

By default the connection between your computer and the server is not encrypted. This makes your connection more vulnerable to external access. In order to protect user credentials and other confidential information stored in Moodle, you can generate an SSL certificate issued by Let's Encrypt for free.

1. Make sure the system is updated and then install Let's Encrypt.
    ```
    apt update && apt -y upgrade
    apt-get install letsencrypt
    ```

    We now run a `certbot`, provided with Let's Encrypt, to generate a wildcard certificate. This ensures not only the coverage of the domain name but of all possible subdomains (\*.example.com).

    For wildcard certificates, a `DNS` challenge is required.
2. Use DNS to challenge domain ownership, specify the endpoint and agree to ACME's subscriber terms simultaneously and run the command below. Replace `admin@example.com` with your e-mail and `example.com` with your domain name.
    ```
    certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges=dns --email admin@example.com --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory --agree-tos -d example.com -d *.example.com
    ```
3. Answer the questions below when prompted. If you agree, type `y` and enter when prompted.
    ```
    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    Would you be willing to share your email address with the Electronic Frontier
    Foundation, a founding partner of the Let's Encrypt project and the non-profit
    organization that develops Certbot? We'd like to send you email about our work
    encrypting the web, EFF news, campaigns, and ways to support digital freedom.
    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    (Y)es/(N)o: y

    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    NOTE: The IP of this machine will be publicly logged as having requested this
    certificate. If you're running certbot in manual mode on a machine that is not
    your server, please ensure you're okay with that.

    Are you OK with your IP being logged?
    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    (Y)es/(N)o: y
    ```

    Then, you will be requested to add a `TXT` record through a DNS entry in your DNS provider's interface.

    ```
    Please deploy a DNS TXT record under the name
    `_acme-challenge.example.com` with the following value:

    `yOdiaGhHq4zLPTmG8eHOUr5bfBTiYZ-w-3_oFqmZuZw`

    Before continuing, verify the record is deployed.
    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    Press Enter to Continue
    ```

    After deploying the record, wait several minutes and **Press Enter to Continue**. You may be prompted to deploy more than one record, as an additional challenge.

    <Message type="note">
      Depending on the DNS provider, a record might take longer to be deployed.
    </Message>

    When the authentication process has been successfully completed, the wildcard certificates will be ready, and you will see the following output:

    ```
    Waiting for verification...
    Cleaning up challenges

    IMPORTANT NOTES:
    - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
      /etc/letsencrypt/live/scaleway-test.ga/fullchain.pem
      Your key file has been saved at:
      /etc/letsencrypt/live/scaleway-test.ga/privkey.pem
      Your cert will expire on 2020-09-16. To obtain a new or tweaked
      version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot
      again. To non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run
      "certbot renew"
    ```
4. Resume the configuration of Let's Encrypt by re-opening the `moodle` server block.
    ```
    nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/moodle
    ```

    And include the new settings, as indicated below. Replace `example.com` with your domain name when necessary.

    ```
    server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;
        server_name *.example.com;
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
    server {
        listen 443 ssl http2;
        listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
        root /var/www/moodle;
        index  index.php index.html index.htm;
        server_name  example.com www.example.com;

        if ($host != "example.com") {
          return 301 https://example.com$request_uri;
        }

    ```
5. Restart PHP and Nginx.
    ```
    systemctl reload nginx.service
    systemctl reload php-fpm.service
    ```
