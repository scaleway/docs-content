Scaleway's Savings Plan is a commitment-based discount program that provides more cost-effective billing compared to the pay-as-you-go model. This plan merges the benefits of discounted rates with the adaptability of pay-as-you-go billing.

## How do Scaleway Savings Plans work?

When you purchase a Savings Plan, you:

1. Commit to a certain amount of spending per month for a set period of time (3 years, for example).
    <Message type="note">
      Commitment rates are calculated based on the public prices of resources before taxes and do not include any discounts.
    </Message>
2. Receive a discount on your monthly bill in exchange.
3. Have the discount applied to the total amount of resources you use, up to the committed amount.

    <Message type="important">
      Keep in mind that:
        - If you use less than what you committed to, you will still be billed for the committed amount with the Savings Plan discount applied.
        - If you use more resources than the committed amount, you will be charged the standard prices for the excess amount.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-savings-plan.webp" size="medium" alt="the image contains a graph showing a simulation of how the Savings Plan works for an account. X axis = month and Y axis = commitment amount in Euro. A horizontal line represents the committed amount. The graph displays the consumption of an account over three months. In the first month, the consumption is under the committed amount, so under the line. For the second month, the consumption is exactly the committed amount, so it joins the line. On the third and last month, the consumption went over the committed amount. Therefore, it goes over the line." />

### Example

If you have Savings Plan with a committed amount of 900€ per month, a 10% discount is applied. You consumption within the Savings Plan will cost you 810€ per month.

If in the month of March, you use:

| Number of Instances | Instance Type         | Hourly Price | Usage (in hours)  | Monthly total |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ------ | ------ |------ |
| 1        | DEV-1S |  0.008€   | 744  | 5.95€ |
| 1    | POP2-64C-256G      | 2.35€ | 381 | 895.35€ |
|   |  |      | **Total**  | 901.30€ |

Since the Savings Plan has a committed amount of 900€, you would be charged:

**810€** (the discounted monthly fee for the committed amount) **+** **1.03€** (the excess amount used above the committed amount, charged at the standard price) **=** **811.03€**.

This means your total bill for March would be **811.03€**.

### Eligibility and quotas

Your Organization is eligible to purchase a Savings Plan if:
    - It does not have any ongoing signed sales agreements with Scaleway
    - You have verified your identity via the Scaleway console
    - Does not have any outstanding invoices

### Scope

Currently, Scaleway only offers Savings Plans for compute resources.

### Commitment amount

The monthly commitment amount for a Savings Plan must be at least €50 and at most €9,999. The amount you specify will determine in which discount bracket your plan falls.

### Duration

The commitment period can last 12 or 36 months. The longer the commitment, the higher the discount offered.

### Payment options

Payments are made on a monthly basis as part of your regular billing cycle.

### Discounts

Savings Plan discounts are applied automatically to the eligible services.

At Scaleway, the discounts are applied in the following order:
    - Free tiers or free trials - Savings Plan discounts will apply after any eligible free tier or trials have been used. This ensures that you maximize your free usage before the Savings Plan discount is applied.
    - Savings plans, and
    - Discounts (vouchers or credits) - Any applicable vouchers or credits are used and applied after the Savings Plan discount.

Understanding this order helps you optimize your savings and ensure that you make the most of the available discounts.

### Cancellations and exchanges

Savings plans cannot be canceled or exchanged.

If you need to request a change to your savings plan, [contact the sales team](http://scaleway.com/en/cancel-saving-plans/ ).

We do not make refunds for savings plans that have already been invoiced.

### Taxes and currency

The total cost displayed for the Savings Plan does not include applicable taxes. Taxes are displayed on a dedicated section of the invoice, under the summary of your Projects' total consumption.

Currently, we invoice all customers in euros (EUR). If your primary currency is different, our Payment Service Providers (PSPs) apply the prevailing exchange rate.
