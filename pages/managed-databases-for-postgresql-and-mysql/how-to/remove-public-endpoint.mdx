When you create a Database Instance, a public endpoint is automatically attributed to it.

For Read Replicas, you can choose whether they take on a public or private endpoint.

If you are using a public endpoint with your Database Instances or Read Replicas, you can remove them anytime in the Scaleway console.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- A [PostgreSQL or MySQL Database Instance](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/quickstart/)

## From Database Instances

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Select the geographical region of the Instance you want to manage from the drop-down.
3. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
4. Scroll to the **Network** section.
5. Click **Remove** next to **Public endpoint**. A pop-up appears.
    <Message type="important">
      When you remove a public endpoint, your Database Instance becomes inaccessible over the internet.
    </Message>
6. Click **Remove public endpoint** to do so.

    Your Database Instance re-initializes.

<Message type="tip">
  Click **Add public endpoint** in the **Network** section to re-add a public endpoint. When you add a new public endpoint, a new IPv4 address and port will be generated. Make sure you update the configuration of your applications with the new endpoint.
