This page sets out some current limitations of Scaleway Load Balancer.

- A Load Balancer's pulic IP address can only be IPv4. However it is possible to use IPv6 between your Load Balancer and backend servers.
- Each Load Balancer supports only one public IP address.

For further information, refer to the [Load Balancers FAQ](https://www.scaleway.com/en/faq/load-balancer/) and [API documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/load-balancer/zoned-api/).
