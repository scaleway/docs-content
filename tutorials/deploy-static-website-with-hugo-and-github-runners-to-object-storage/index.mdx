Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in Go. The application is designed to take a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML website.
It uses Markdown files with front matter for metadata making it lightweight and easily to use. 

In this tutorial you learn how to install Hugo on your local computer so you can build your website locally, before pushing your content into a GitHub repository where a GitHub runner will take the content, generate the HTML version of it and uploads on a Object Storage bucket automatically.

## Installing Hugo

Hugo is available for most operating systems. In this tutorial we describe the installation on a Unbuntu Linux system. For other operating systems, refer to the [official documentation](https://gohugo.io/installation/).

1. Open a terminal on your computer. 
2. Make sure your `apt` package manager is up to date:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   ```
3. Install Hugo using `apt`:
   ```
   sudo apt install hugo
   ```

## Creating a new site

Run the following commands to create a new site using Hugo. 

1. Create the site. In this example the site is named `mysuperwebsite`. You can give it a name of your choice. 
    ```
    hugo new site mysuperwebsite
    ```
2. Enter the website directory
    ```
    cd mysuperwebsite
    ```
