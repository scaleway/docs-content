Created by [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/), InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a decentralized protocol used to store and share content.

Scaleway IPFS Naming allows you to create a key to point to your latest update, and above all maintain this information on the IPFS network and share it through DHTs, giving you an extra layer of performance in the region of your choice. That way, your records remains available and accessible, even when your local machine is offline.

In this quick start, we'll show you how to create or import an ipns key and then update your record, using Scaleway IPFS Naming.
