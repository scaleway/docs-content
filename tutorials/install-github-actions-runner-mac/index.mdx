  You have:
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created a Mac mini](/bare-metal/apple-silicon/how-to/create-mac-mini/)
  - You have a Github repository with administrator rights.
  - You have installed a package manager. For the sake of this tutorial, we will use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/index) which is a popular package manager for macOS.

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that allows users to automate their software development workflows, connected to a Github organization or repository. While GitHub offers online runners with a pay-as-you-go model, self-hosted runners grant increased control over your CI/CD setup and enhanced customization. This is because you manage the runners yourself, rather than relying on GitHubâ€™s infrastructure. This tutorial shows you how to set up, configure, and connect a self-hosted runner on a Mac mini to execute macOS pipelines.

<Message type="tip">
  GitHub [recommends](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#self-hosted-runner-security) using self-hosted runners with private repositories for enhanced security.

## Preparing for installation

Before starting the installation process, create a dedicated user account named "gh-runner" on your Mac mini and add it to the admin group. Execute the following terminal commands:

```bash
# Create the 'gh-runner' user account
sudo dscl . -create /Users/gh-runner UserShell /bin/bash
# Additional commands to create and configure the user...

# Add 'gh-runner' to the 'admin' group
sudo dscl . -append /Groups/admin GroupMembership gh-runner
```

After a reboot, use the 'gh-runner' account for configuring the self-hosted runner.

## Installing Git and Rosetta 2

Ensure Git and Rosetta 2 are installed on your Mac mini:

```bash
git --version
brew install git

# Install Rosetta 2 if not already installed
softwareupdate --install-rosetta
```
<Message type="note">
  Rosetta 2 is a translation technology developed by Apple for Macs with Apple Silicon processors, enabling them to run applications designed for Intel-based Macs by dynamically translating the software's instructions to a format compatible with the new architecture.

## Installing and configuring the Runner

1. Navigate to your [GitHub repository](https://github.com/) and go to **Settings**.
2. Click **Actions** under **Code and automation**, then select **Runners**.
3. Click **New self-hosted runner** to be redirected to the configuration page.
4. Choose **macOS** as the runner image and **ARM64** as the architecture.
5. Follow the prompted shell commands to authenticate your machine, download the necessary runtime, and set up the runner.
    <Message type="note">
        After selecting the runner image and architecture, GitHub prompts you to execute a sequence of shell commands. Those commands serve to authenticate your machine with your Github repository, download the necessary runtime and set-up the runner within your environment. Take note of these commands, as you will need to execute them on your Mac mini.
    </Message>
6. [Connect](/bare-metal/apple-silicon/how-to/connect-to-mac-mini/) to your Mac mini using VNC. Note that SSH cannot be used as a graphical session is required.
7. Open a terminal and execute the commands prompted by GitHub, but do not launch the runner yet.
8. Create a `.env` file in the runner folder for essential environment variables:

    ```plaintext
    # _work/.env file
    ImageOS=macos13
    XCODE_15_DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
    ```
    Add any additional environment variables required by your actions.

9. Execute the `run.sh` script in your runner directory to complete the setup.

Confirm that the runner is up and listening for jobs in the terminal and check the GitHub repository settings for the runner's association and `Idle` status.

## Using the runner in a workflow

The runner is authenticated to your repository and labeled with `self-hosted`, `macOS`, and `ARM64`. Use it in your workflows by specifying these labels in the `runs-on` field:

```yaml
name: Sample workflow

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, macOS, ARM64]

    steps:
      - name: Install NodeJS
        run: brew install node
```

## Sudoers configuration (optional)

If actions require root privileges, configure the sudoers file using `sudo visudo`. For private repositories, add:

```plaintext
gh-runner ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

<Message type="tip">
  Add application-level restrictions to avoid password prompts.
  ```
  runner ALL= NOPASSWD: /bin/hostname
  # Or your additional applications with arguments:
  runner ALL= NOPASSWD: /bin/hostname,/your_dir/your_bin your_args
  ```

## Conclusion

This tutorial guides you through setting up a self-hosted runner on an Apple silicon-based Mac mini for macOS pipelines. Your runner is now ready to be integrated into your workflows.
