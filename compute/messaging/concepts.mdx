## AMQP

**A**dvanced **M**essage **Q**ueuing **P**rotocol (AMQP) is an open message protocol that allows sending of transactional messages between servers and devices by using a message broker. The advantages of AMQP are reliable communication (data is received exactly once at the receiving end) and interoperability.

</Concept>

## Content-based

Content-based messaging systems contrast with [topic-based](#topic-based) systems. In a content-based messaging system, message delivery is selective. Messages are only delivered to a subscriber if the attributes or content of those messages matches constraints defined by the subscriber. These constraints can be thought of as filters - subscribers specify the properties of the messages they want to receive.

</Concept>

## Credentials

Credentials give services and platforms access to your namesapce, enabling them to connect to the host system. Different permissions can be defined for each set of credentials as required:

    - **Write**: Bearer can send messages to the system
    - **Read**: Bearer can receive messages from the system
    - **Manage**: Bearer can manage queues and topics

Credentials are protocol-specific. Refer to our Messaging Reference Content for more information.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Dead Letter Queue

A **D**ead **L**etter **Q**ueue (DLQ), or **undelivered-message queue**, receives and holds messages that cannot be delivered to their destination queues. You may define an existing queue as a Dead Letter Queue.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Fanout

Fanout is a type of messaging pattern. A fanout exchange broadcasts messages to all queues/consumers it is aware of. This allows the same published message to be consumed by different consumers, who will process it in different ways.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Filtering

In a [topic-based](#topic-based) system, where topics handle the logic, filtering is similar to routing.
In a [content-based](#content-based) system, filtering is carried out by subscribers, who filter messages based on the content/attribute they want to receive.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Long Polling

Long polling is a technology where the client requests information from the server without expecting an immediate response. In SQS this enable clients to wait for the system to get messages that are not immediately available.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Messaging

Scaleway's Messaging product is a message broker tool that allows you to transfer messages between different microservices and platforms, allowing them to "talk" to each other effectively even if they are not otherwise compatible. Messages are stored in queues until they are ready to be processed. Messaging therefore enables and simplifies microservices application development and allows you to build highly scalable, reliable, distributed applications. 

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Namespace

A Messaging namespace enables systems, applications, and services to communicate with each other and exchange information. It translates messages so that different formal messaging protocols can communicate with one another, even if they are written in different programming languages or implemented on different platforms. Namespaces also allow you to isolate queues and group credentials.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## NATS

The **N**eural **A**utonomic **T**ransport **S**ystem, or NATS, is an open-source messaging system written in the Go programming language. It is part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and has more than 40 client language implementations. The application has been designed with performance, scalability, and ease of use in mind.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Queue

A message queue is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures. Messages are stored in the queue until they are processed and deleted.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Routing

In topic-based messaging, topics allow messages to be routed to the correct subscribers. Topics act as labels for each message, and the broker routes messages to subscribers who match the topic.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## SNS

The **S**imple **N**otification **S**ervice, or SNS, is a publish/subscribe notification service for the mass delivery of messages. SNS acts as a single message bus that can be sent to a variety of devices and platforms through a single code interface. It is also possible to adapt message formats to the particular needs of each platform. SNS/SQS is one of the namespace types / messaging systems available at Scaleway. You can use the SNS and/or SQS messaging systems with this type of namespace.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## SQS

The **S**imple **Q**ueue **S**ervice, or SQS, is a distributed message queuing service that supports programmatic sending of messages via web service applications. The SQS protocol offers two types of message queues: 
- **Standard** queues offer maximum throughput, best-effort ordering, and at-least-once delivery. 
- **FIFO** queues are designed to guarantee that messages are processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent.
SNS/SQS is one of the namespace types / messaging systems available at Scaleway. You can use the SNS and/or SQS messaging systems with this type of namespace.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Stream

Distinct from traditional message brokers where messages are deleted once received/consumed, streams retain records of their events. A streaming broker is therefore often likened to a distributed append-only logs file, where every new message is added at the end of the persistent log. Each message can be delivered to one or more consumers.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Subscriber

In [SNS](#sns) a subscriber is the entity (e.g. SQS Queue, Function, URL) that messages from topics are pushed to. Subscribers can filter messages based on their topic or content.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Topic-based

Topic-based messaging systems contrast with [content-based](#content-based) systems. In a topic-based system, messages are published to "topics" or named logical channels. Subscribers in a topic-based system receive all messages published to the topics to which they subscribe. The publisher is responsible for defining the possible topics which can be subscribed to.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Topic/Exchange

A topic (or 'exchange' in [AMQP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Message_Queuing_Protocol)) is a named resource to which messages are sent by publishers.
