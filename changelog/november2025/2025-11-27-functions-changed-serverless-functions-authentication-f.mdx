Serverless Functions uses a product-specific authentication method based on JWT to authenticate requests for private endpoints. It is now possible to use the new IAM policy `FunctionsPrivateAccess`.

Previous authentication method based on JWT will be deprecated gradually. Follow [How to migrate from JWT to IAM authentication for private functions](/serverless-functions/how-to/migrate-jwt-to-iam-authentication/).
