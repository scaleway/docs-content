### How to recover your password

If you cannot access your email address, please contact our Trust and Safety team with the following information:
- Your username
- Your current and new email addresses
- The telephone number registered on your account
- If you have an individual account, your passport or local ID card
- If you have a corporate account, the certificate of incorporation and a copy of the last Scaleway invoice you received

Submit the complete set of required documents via email to `document@scaleway.com`.

Once your email address is updated, you can submit a [lost password form](https://console.online.net/en/user/recovery) to request the recovery codes for your account.
