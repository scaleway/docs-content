Each Bare Metal server provides a dedicated [KVM over IP](/compute/bare-metal-cloud/concepts/#remote-access) device, allowing you to access the keyboard, video, and mouse of the machine remotely. This gives you access to the machine for debugging purposes, even if the installed OS is not working properly. You can also install an OS of your own from a remote ISO file.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)  
- You have [configured your SSH Key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key)
- You have [created](/compute/bare-metal-cloud/how-to/create-server) and [installed](/compute/bare-metal-cloud/how-to/install-server) a Bare Metal server (**KVM-over-IP is not available unless an OS image is installed**)

</Message>

1. Click **Bare Metal** in the **Compute** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Bare Metal dashboard displays.

2. Click the name of the server you want to access using the KVM-over-IP device.

3. Validate the terms of use for the KVM over IP access, check the corresponding box and click **Manage Connection**:

4. Enter the [IP address](https://www.whatsmyip.org/) of your Internet connection in the pop-up box and confirm. The KVM-over-IP connection credentials displays:

5. Open the connection URL displayed in a new browser window and log into the [BMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Platform_Management_Interface#Baseboard_management_controller) of the server with the provided username and password.

6. Click **Remote Control** in the menu on top of the page, then on **Console Redirection**. A [Java Web Start](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Web_Start) file is downloaded to the local computer.

7. Launch the remote console by double-clicking the downloaded file:

8. Click **Media** > **Virtual Media Wizzard** to mount a local ISO file.

9. Choose the ISO file for the virtual CD ROM by clicking **Browse**. Then mount it by clicking **Connect CD/DVD**:

   Once the image file is connected, the following message displays:

10. Click **Power** > **Power Cycle Server** to reboot the server.

11. Press **F11** to enter the BIOS boot menu once the server has rebooted, and the logo of the manufacturer displays.

12. Select **AMI Virtual CDROM0 1.00** in the list of boot devices.

The server boots on the ISO image connected as virtual media. You can now continue with the installation of your Bare Metal server using the setup tool of the OS.
