This page shows how to get started with Scaleway Messaging and Queuing. The process differs depending on the [messaging protocol](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#messaging-protocol) you want to use:

- For NATS, you need to **create a NATS account**.
- For SQS or SNS, you need to **activate the protocol**.

Both procedures are described in full below.

## How to create a NATS account

To start using a NATS message broker, you must first create a NATS account. This sets a scope for your NATS credentials, messages, queues and stream.

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The following screen displays:

2. Click **NATS**. The following screen displays:

4. Complete the following steps in the wizard:

    - Choose a **region**, which is the geographical location in whic your NATS account will be created. Currently, only the `PARIS` region is available.
    - Enter a **name** for your NATS account, or use the auto-generated name suggested for you.
    - Optional: Use the *Estimated cost** calculator to simulate how messages sent and stored with NATS streams will be billed. Note that simply creating a NATS account does not in itself incur any billing. For more information about NATS billing, see the [FAQ](TODO). 
    - Click **Create NATS account** to finish

    You are directed to the listing of your NATS accounts, where your newly-created NATS account now appears.

    You can create more NATS accounts if you wish, by clicking on the `+ Create NATS account` button.
    </Message>


## How to activate SQS or SNS

SQS and SNS are handled as two separate protocols. Each one needs to be activated before you can start creating credentials, queues, topics etc for this protocol. You can choose to activate one or both protocols as you like. You can deactivate each protocol at any time.

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The following screen displays:

    TODO screenshot

2. Click **SQS** or **SNS** depending on the protcol you want to activate.

    A message displays prompting you to click a button to activate the protocol. It also reminds you that activating the protocol does not trigger any billing, and that you can deactivate at any time.

3. Click **Actvate SQS** (or SNS).

    The protocol is activated and you are invited to [generate credentials](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-credentials/).
