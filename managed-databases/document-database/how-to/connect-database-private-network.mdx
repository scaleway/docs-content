[Private Networks](/network/vpc/concepts/#private-networks) allows you to enhance the security of your system's architecture by isolating it from the internet.

When using Private Networks, your application connects directly to your Database nodes without going through a Load Balancer.

This improves performance by reducing the latency between your application and your database nodes. It also increases the security of your databases, as Instances in your Private Network can directly communicate with your Database Instance, without passing through the public internet.

You can create new Database Instances to attach to your Private Network, or attach existing ones.
