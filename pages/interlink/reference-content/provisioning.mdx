<Message type="important">
InterLink is currently in [Private Beta](https://www.scaleway.com/en/betas/) TODO CHECK, and only available to selected testers.
</Message>

The process of ordering an InterLink has multiple stages: action is required both from Scaleway, the user, and from the selected [partner](/interlink/concepts/#partner). When preparing your InterLink order, you must choose appropriate location (aka **P**oint **o**f **P**resence), partner and region settings to ensure compatibility with your external and Scaleway infrastructure.

On the left, Scaleway’s PAR region includes a VPC with an InterLink and vRouter connected to the PAR backbone. This links to a Point of Presence (PoP) in Paris (TH2), where both Scaleway and partner routers are located. The partner’s infrastructure connects the Paris PoP to a customer or partner PoP, such as in Marseille. The customer PoP has a partner router and a customer router connected through an MMR (Meet-Me Room). The setup supports either on-premises customer infrastructure via last-mile connection or hosted customer infrastructure in the partner’s data center" />

This document explains the provisioning process in full, so you know what to expect when ordering an InterLink, what action is required from all parties, and how to deal with any potential errors.

## Provisioning overview

<Lightbox src="scaleway-interlink-ordering.webp" alt="A four step flow chart shows the following steps: 1. User orders InterLink via Scaleway, 2. User requests InterLink from partner, 3. Partner accepts InterLink request, 4. Partner provisions InterLink." />

The diagram above shows the four steps necessary to provision an InterLink. Only when all steps have been completed will the InterLink move to an **Active** status, ready for traffic to flow. Read more about each step, and possible errors at each stage, in the following sections.

For full information about different statuses an InterLink might flow through, see our [dedicated documentation on InterLink statuses](/interlink/reference-content/statuses/).

### 1. User orders InterLink via Scaleway

The order process begins when you order an InterLink via the Scaleway [InterLink API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/interlink/) or the [Scaleway console](/network/interlink/how-to/order-interlink/), or one of our other [developer tools](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/). When ordering, you set the following parameters:

- **Connection type**: In the long term, both dedicated and hosted InterLinks will be available. For now, only **hosted** connections (facilitated via a partner) are available.
- **Partner**: The third-party service provider to facilitate the InterLink. A list of available partners is shown in the console, or for the API you can Use the [List available partners](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/interlink/#path-partners-list-available-partners) call.
- **Region**: The region in which to create the InterLink. It must correspond to the region of the Scaleway VPC you want to later attach to the InterLink.
- **Location**: The physical **P**oint **o**f **P**resence (PoP) where the connection to Scaleway's network will be established, via the partner.
- **Bandwidth**: The maximum bandwidth which you want to be available over the InterLink.
- **Name**: A name (and, optionally, tags) for the InterLink.

<Message type="tip">
Scaleway starts charging for the InterLink as soon as your order is placed. You must then wait for the partner to provision the connection, and they may charge you additional fees.
</Message>

Immediately after ordering, it is expected that your InterLink will briefly be in `Configuring` status, before moving to `Requested` status. See the [statuses documentation](/interlink/reference-content/statuses/) for help with resolving any error statuses.

### 2. User requests InterLink from partner

After ordering the InterLink from Scaleway, you **must** contact your chosen partner to request that they provision the connection on their side. Scaleway is not able to automatically do this step for you.

See [how to contact partner](/interlink/how-to/complete-provisioning/#contact-partner-to-request-interlink) for full details.

Your InterLink will remain in `Requested` status until the partner responds to your request. See the [statuses documentation](/interlink/reference-content/statuses/) for help with resolving any error statuses.

### 3. Partner accepts InterLink request

When the partner approves your request, the InterLink moves to `Provisioning` status. This means that the partner has agreed to facilitate your InterLink, and is now preparing the resources and configuration necessary to establish the physical connection. 

Your InterLink will remain in `Provisioning` status until this process has been completed. See the [statuses documentation](/interlink/reference-content/statuses/) for help with resolving any error statuses.

### 4. Partner provisions InterLink

When the partner has finished provisioning your InterLink, it moves to `Active` status. This indicates that the physical link and necessary accompanying configuration has been completed on the partner's side, and your InterLink is ready for use. See the [statuses documentation](/interlink/reference-content/statuses/) for help with resolving any error statuses.

You must still configure your InterLink by attaching it to a VPC, attaching an allowed routes list, and activating route propagation, before traffic can flow over the InterLink. For help with these steps, see our documentation on [configuring your InterLink](/interlink/how-to/configure-interlink/).

## Deprovisioning overview

When you no longer want your InterLink connection, you can delete it. The process is as follows:

1. Deactivate route propagation.
2. [Delete your InterLink on the Scaleway side](/interlink/how-to/delete-interlink/). InterLink status moves to `Deprovisioning`.
3. Contact your partner to request they deprovision the InterLink resource on their side.
4. InterLink moves to `Deleted` status once the partner has completed deprovisioning.

Scaleway stops billing you for your InterLink immediately after step 2. Your partner may continue to bill you until they deprovision the resource on their side.

<Message type="note">
If the provisioning of your InterLink by the partner was never completed, e.g. you a) never contacted the partner to request provisioning of the InterLink, or b) the partner refused to provision your InterLink, you do not need to contact the partner again to request that they deprovision the resource. Deleting it on the Scaleway side is sufficient.
