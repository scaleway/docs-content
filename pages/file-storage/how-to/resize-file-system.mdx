This page explains how to resize a file system using the Scaleway console.

import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a file system](/file-storage/how-to/create-file-system/)

1. Click **File Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. A list of your file systems displays.

2. Click the name of the file system you want to resize. The **Overview** page displays.

3. Click the **Resize** button. A pop-up displays.

4. Enter a new size for your file system.
    <Message type="important">
    - New file system size cannot be inferior to the currently used space.
    - File system size must be at least 100 GB.
    - File system size can only be resized by increments of 100 GB.
    </Message>

5. Review the updated estimated cost. File Storage billing is based on the provisioned file storage size, and not on actual usage.

6. Click **Resize file system** to confirm.

Your file system is resized, and its new capacity displays in the **Overview** page.

<Message type="note">
You can also resize a file system from the [File Storage section](https://console.scaleway.com/file-storage/) of the console, by clicking <Icon name="more" /> next to its name, and by selecting **Resize** from the drop-down menu.
