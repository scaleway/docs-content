An informational website, such as a portfolio, blog, or showcase, offers numerous benefits. It provides a platform to easily share your ideas, work, and expertise with a global audience. The process of deploying such a site is straightforward and cost-effective. With built-in security features, it ensures your content is protected, while reliable performance guarantees a smooth user experience for your visitors.

Your informational website can be based on several different architectures, that all come with benefits and tradeoffs:

| Deployment Method       | Benefits                                      | Tradeoffs                            |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Based on Object Storage | Cost-effective and highly available, suitable for static content. | Limited to serving static files, no server-side processing. |
| Based on Web Hosting    | Easy to set up and manage, suitable for small to medium websites. | Less control over the environment, can be limited in terms of customization. |
| Based on Instances      | Full control over the server environment, suitable for complex applications. | More complex setup and management, potentially higher costs. |
| Based on Elastic Metal (Aluminium) and Flexible IPs | Dedicated physical resources and high performance, suitable for demanding applications. | Higher costs, requires more technical expertise to manage. |

## Hosting a website using Instances	

Hosting using Instances is a solution suited for users familiar with Unix operating systems and command line installations of tools like WordPress, Nginx, MySQL, and PHP. It offers full control over the virtual infrastructure and app installations, but requires maintenance by the user.

  - [Deploy WordPress on an existing Instance](/tutorials/wordpress-lemp-stack/) with LEMP on Ubuntu Bionic Beaver.

3. [Configure your domain name and its DNS records](/domains-and-dns/how-to/configure-dns-zones/).

4. [Create an image of your Instance](/instances/how-to/create-a-backup/).

5. (Optional) Edit your WordPress settings to add your domain name.

## Hosting a website using Elastic Metal (Aluminium)

Elastic Metal (Aluminium) is an expert-level solution for users who require full control over the infrastructure. It provides optimal performance by leveraging the dedicated hardware resources at a cost lower than equivalent instances. You can install any operating system and applications you need, but you are responsible for maintaining your entire software stack.

2. [Create an Elastic Metal server](/elastic-metal/how-to/create-server/) running **Ubuntu**.

2. [Deploy WordPress on your Elastic Metal server](/tutorials/wordpress-lemp-stack/#installing-the-stack).
