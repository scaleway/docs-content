Since January 8th, 2025, the permission set `ResellerCustomerBillingManager` cannot be used in policies. This permission set was only available for clients that consume Scaleway services through a reseller.

For Organizations that used this permission set, the permission set was renamed from `ResellerCustomerBillingManager` to `BillingManager`. Scripts that used the former name of the permission set, such as Terraform scripts, should be updated to use the new `BillingManager` name.
