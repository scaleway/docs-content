You can enable two-factor authentication on your account for heightened security. Once enabled, an additional security code, generated by your phone, is required to access your account.

Two-factor authentication provides an extra layer of security. As well as your password (the first factor), a second factor (the 2FA app) is required to gain access to your account. Even in case of leaked password, your account is protected by this second layer of security.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net)
  - You have downloaded a 2FA Authenticator application to your phone
</Message>

1. Click your user name next to _logged in as:_ in the top right corner of the console. Then click **Security** in the pop-up menu.

    <Message type="tip"> 
      If your phone does not have a camera, you can manually enter the registration code shown in the console.
    </Message> 
3. Open the authenticator application on your phone and scan the code using the application.
4. A registration code is displayed on your phone's display. Enter this code in the activation form and click **Enable** to validate.

    Your account is now protected by two-factor authentication, and a security token will be requested upon your next login.

<Message type="important">
  Make sure to keep your authentication device secure as you can't log in without the 2FA security token.
