An Elastic Metal server can be reinstalled at any time from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com). This can be useful when you want to run a different image on the machine or if you want to have a fresh installation.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An Elastic Metal server [installed](/elastic-metal/quickstart/#how-to-create-an-elastic-metal-server)

<Message type="important">
  Reinstalling your server permanently erases the disk and all its data. Make sure to have a backup before reinstalling your server.

1. Click **Elastic Metal** in the **Bare Metal** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Elastic Metal dashboard displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the server you want to reinstall. A drop-down menu displays.
3. Click **Reinstall** in the menu to enter the installation wizard.
4. Complete the server reinstallation wizard:
    - Choose an OS to run on your server or opt for custom installation.
    - Configure server partitioning. You can either choose a default configuration or [configure your own partitioning](/elastic-metal/how-to/configure-disk-partitions/).
    - Enter a name and, optionally, add tags to identify your server.
    - Add your SSH key (required if installing an image on your server). Depending on the OS image, you may also be asked to configure the panel user for your server.
5. Click **Reinstall server** to launch the installation.
