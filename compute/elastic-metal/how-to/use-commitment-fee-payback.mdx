You pay a commitment fee when you order your Elastic Metal server with monthly billing. This fee covers the cost of the setup of your machine, and you benefit from a lower monthly price. You are entitled to a commitment fee payback (credit) if your server is up and running for 12 consecutive months without termination.

The amount of the credit is the price of the commitment fees at the time of purchase. It can be used for all Scaleway Cloud products (except Elastic Metal servers and their associated options) and is valid for six months. You receive the credit once per physical server, and it is automatically credited to your Scaleway account.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)  
  - You have had an Elastic Metal server up and running for 12 consecutive months

The following rules apply to the commitment fee payback: 

* You are entitled to the commitment fee payback:
   * Once you have kept your Elastic Metal server running for 12 consecutive months without stopping
   * Once per physical server in your account

* The commitment fee payback:
   * Corresponds to the sum of the commitment fee paid when the server was ordered (excl. taxes)
   * Is usable for all cloud resources except Elastic Metal servers and their related options
   * Is valid for six months
   * Is splittable over several months

<Message type="tip">
  The credit is available for six months and can be consumed pro rata per month or all at once. For example, if you received 49€ of credit and consumed 15€ of cloud resources during the first month, we will roll over the remaining 34€ in the next month.

  The commitment fee payback is a cloud credit that can be used for Scaleway Cloud services (except Elastic Metal servers and their associated options). It is not possible to get a cash refund of the commitment fees.
