**F**ile **T**ransfer **P**rotcol is a standard way to transfer files between a client (such as your local computer) and a server (such as your Scaleway webhosting server) via the Internet. This documentation shows you how to configure the popular and free FTP client [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) to connect to your webhosting site using FTP. You will then be able to transfer files from your local computer to your Scaleway webhosting server, following the [documentation provided by Filezilla](https://wiki.filezilla-project.org/FileZilla_Client_Tutorial_(en)) if necessary.

In our example, we consider your domain name to be `example.com` and your FTP account to be `webmaster@example.com`. Remember that you need to [create an FTP account](/dedibox-console/classic-hosting/how-to/create-ftp-account/) before proceeding.

<Message type="requirement">

### Installing FileZilla

1. Open the [FileZilla website](https://filezilla-project.org/) in your browser.
2. Click **Download FileZilla Client**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-download-filezilla.webp" alt="" />

    The FileZilla website detects your operating system, and suggests the correct version of the FileZilla client to download.
3. Click **Download FileZilla Client** and follow the on-screen prompts to complete installation.
    <Message type="tip">
      Depending on your operating system, you may prefer to download FileZilla from the command line of your terminal. On Ubuntu Linux, use the command `sudo apt update && sudo apt install filezilla`.
    </Message>

### Configuring the FTP account

1. Open Filezilla on your local machine.
2. Click on **File** in the top menu, and select **Site Manager**.
3. Enter the following information in the form that displays. Remember to replace the **User** and **Password** values with [those of your FTP account](/dedibox-console/classic-hosting/how-to/create-ftp-account/)
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-filezilla-newsite.webp" alt="" />

    - **Protocol**: FTP - File Transfer Protocol
    - **Host**: `ftp.online.net`
    - **Port**: `21`
    - **Encryption**: `Require explicit FTP over TLS`
    - **Logon Type**: `Normal`
    - **User**: `webmaster@example.com`
    - **Password**: `your-ftp-password`

      <Message type="note">
      The above form may display slightly differently depending on your operating system, but the fields and their values should remain the same.
      </Message>
4. Click **Connect**. If a confirmation window appears, check and validate the certificate.

  You are connected via FTP to your webhosting site. Remember that all files for your website must be stored in the `www` folder.

  See the official [FileZilla documentation](https://wiki.filezilla-project.org/Documentation) for more help with using FileZilla to connect to your site and transfer files with FTP.
