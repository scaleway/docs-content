In this tutorial, you will learn how to send emails with [Transactional Email](/managed-services/transactional-email/quickstart/) and [Serverless Functions](/serverless/functions/quickstart/) using the [Serverless Framework tool](/serverless/functions/reference-content/deploy-function/#serverless-framework).

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />
 
<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your domain with Transactional Email and added SPF, DKIM and MX records](/managed-services/transactional-email/quickstart/)
  - You have [installed the Scaleway CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli) on your machine
</Message>

## Install and clone the necessary tools

1. Open a terminal and paste the following command to install the Serverless Framework CLI on your local machine:

        ```
        npm install serverless -g
        ```
2. Clone the GitHub repository containing the configuration files needed to deploy your function:
        ```
        git clone github.com:scaleway/serverless-examples.git
        ```

3. Access the `go-mail` directory:
        ```
        cd serverless-examples/functions/go-mail
        ```
4. Paste the following command to install the Serverless plugin:
        ```
        serverless plugin install -n serverless-scaleway-functions
        ```
5. Copy and paste the following commands to export your environment variables. Make sure you add your **own variables**.
        ```
        export SCW_ACCESS_KEY=<Scaleway access key>
        export SCW_SECRET_KEY=<Scaleway secret key>
        export SCW_DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ID=<Scaleway default Organization>
        export SCW_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID=<Scaleway default Project>
        export SCW_DEFAULT_REGION="fr-par"
        ```

## Add your variables

The `go-mail` directory you have cloned contains a `.env` file in which you will define your environment variables. The `serverless.yml` file will then fetch your variables from the `.env` file. This allows you to avoid hard coding critical information in several files.

1. In the same terminal as the previous steps, access the `.env` file in the `go-mail` directory:
        ```
        nano .env
        ```
2. Replace `CHANGE_ME` with your pertinent environment variables. Your `.env` file should look like the following:

        ```
        SCW_DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ID: f7d9b14a-c5fe-4e50-bb6e-4c7474ee611d
        SCW_ACCESS_KEY: SCWDAC6A76BF6DC4EFD65
        SCW_SECRET_KEY: f5dd7248-ebf1-4cea-abe6-60b58eb5df58
        SENDER_MAIL: example@mail.com
        ```
3. Press `CTRL O` and `Enter` to save your changes.
4. Press `CTRL X` to exit the `.env` file.

## Deploy your function

1. In the same terminal as the previous steps, paste the following command to trigger the deployment of your function:
        ```
        serverless deploy
        ```
2. Log in to your Scaleway account and click the Functions section in the left-side menu. Your `gomail` namespace displays.
3. Click the `gomail` namespace, then click the `gomail` function.
4. Click the **Endpoints** tab and copy your function's domain. Make sure you save it as you will need it in the next steps.
5. Click the **Security** tab, then click **+ Generate token**.

6. Follow the instructions that display in the pop-up and click **Generate token**.
7. Copy your token and make sure that you save it before closing the pop-up.
8. Open your terminal and paste the following command to trigger your function. Make sure that you replace `$FUNCTION_DOMAIN` with your function's domain, `$FUNCTION_TOKEN` with the token you have generated, and `$MAIL_TO` with your recipient's email address. Optionally, you can also edit the `"subject"` and `"message"` fields.
        ```
        curl -v -X POST https://$FUNCTION_DOMAIN -H "X-Auth-Token: $FUNCTION_TOKEN" --data '{"to": "$MAILTO", "subject": "this is a test following the tem and serverless tuto", "message": "very very long message using the api"}'
        ```
