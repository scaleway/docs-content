This page shows you how to create your first functions namespace. [Namespaces](/compute/functions/concepts/#namespace) allow you to group your [functions](/compute/functions/concepts/#function) and share environment variables between them.

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.

2. Click **Create a namespace**. The functions namespace creation wizard displays.
3. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 
    - Enter a **name** and optionally a **description** for your namespace. The first character of your namespace must be a letter. It can only contain letters, numbers, and dashes. No other special characters are permitted. The namespace is case-sensitive and cannot be edited after its creation.
    - Choose a **region**, which is the geographical location in which your namespace will be deployed.
    - Enter any **environment variables** required for your namespace. Environment variables configured in a namespace will be available in all functions/apps within the same namespace. For each environment variable, click **+Add** and enter the key/value pair.
    - Set secret environment variables (optional). **Secrets** are environment variables which are injected into your function and stored securely, but not displayed in the console after initial validation. Add a **key** and a **value**.
    - Verify the **estimated cost**.
4. Click **Create a namespace** to finish.

    Your namespace is now created and you are taken to its **Functions** tab.
