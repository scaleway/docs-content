A Project can only be deleted once it has been emptied of its [resources](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#resource). To effectively delete your Project, you must therefore **empty its resources first**.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a Project](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-a-project) other than the [default Project](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#default-project)
- Erased all the resources of the Project you want to delete

1. Click the **Projects** tab from the [Organization Dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/organization). A list of your Projects displays.
2. Click the name of the project you want to delete.
2. Click the **Settings** tab.
3. Scroll down to find the **Delete Project** section.
4. Click **Delete Project**. A pop-up appears requesting you to confirm that you want to delete the selected Project.
    <Message type="important">
    - If your Project contains existing resources, a list of said resources appears. You must delete each resource before continuing, as only empty Projects can be deleted.

    - The default Project cannot be deleted.
    </Message>
5. Click **Delete Project** to confirm.

    You are redirected to the default Project dashboard.

<Message type="tip">
Alternatively, you can delete a project from the **Projects** tab of the [Organization Dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/organization/projects), by clicking <Icon name="more" />, then **Delete** next to the name of the Project you want to delete.
