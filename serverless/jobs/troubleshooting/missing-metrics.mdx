## Problem

I can't see metrics partially or totally for my Serverless Job.

## Cause

Metrics for Serverless Jobs technically limited for very short Jobs under `15` seconds.

## Possible solutions

- If your Job takes more than around `15` seconds and metrics are still missing, it can be due to a [scheduled maintenance](https://status.scaleway.com/). If that's not the case please open a support ticket.
- For very short Jobs, if you need the metrics you can add a `sleep` in your workflow.
