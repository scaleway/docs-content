## Differences between Functions, Containers, and Jobs

Serverless Jobs are designed for batch computing workloads particularly large-scale and asynchronous tasks, like data processing, image rendering, or complex computations.

Choose Scaleway [Serverless Jobs](/serverless/jobs/quickstart/):

- For long-running tasks and resource-intensive applications.
- To handle numerous jobs concurrently.
- If you do not need to expose your service on a port.
- For asynchronous processing.

<Message type="note">
  To run as a Serverless Job, your applications must be containerized, which offers you a lot of choice when configuring your runtime environments.

Choose Scaleway [Serverless Functions](/serverless/functions/quickstart/):

- For stateless and short-lived workloads (< 15 minutes).
- For event-driven tasks.
- For optimum performance in lightweight scenarios.
- For autoscaling applications.
- For web-facing applications and web servers.

<Message type="note">
  Serverless Functions can only be written in languages [available as runtimes](/serverless/functions/reference-content/functions-lifecycle/#available-runtimes).
</Message>

Choose Scaleway [Serverless Containers](/serverless/containers/quickstart/):

- For stateless, short-lived applications (< 15 minutes).
- For event-driven tasks.
- If your programming language is not supported as a Serverless Function runtime.
- For autoscaling workloads.

  To run as a Serverless Container, your application must be containerized, giving you a lot of flexibility to configure your runtime environments.
