This documentation addresses an issue faced by users who are unable to connect to their Mac Mini via SSH.
This problem typically arises because the user's SSH key has not been uploaded to the Mac Mini.
It can also happen after multiple authentication failures while trying to access the VNC server because of default fail2ban security policies
This guide provides the necessary steps to resolve this issue by connecting to the Scaleway console and rebooting the Mac Mini from the Apple Silicon section.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- A [Mac mini](/bare-metal/apple-silicon/how-to/create-mac-mini/)

1. Click **Apple silicon** in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu. A list of your Mac minis displays.
2. Click the Mac mini you want to configure. Your Mac mini information page displays.
3. Scroll down to the **Reboot Mac mini** section. Click **Reboot** to reboot the Mac mini.
    <Message type="tip">
      Ensure you have [generated and uploaded your SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/) before rebooting your Mac mini.

4. Click **Reboot Mac mini** to confirm. The Mac mini reboots and your SSH key will be uploaded during the boot process. Banned host lists are reset as well.
