## What is Cockpit?

Cockpit is a monitoring and alerting solution natively integrated with Scaleway's ecosystem. Cockpit allows you to collect, store, and analyze metrics, logs, and traces from your infrastructure and applications, giving you insights into your system's performance and behavior. 

Cockpits are scoped per [Project](/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project) and are automatically activated when you are using [Scaleway resources that are integrated into Cockpit](/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-limitations/#product-integration-into-cockpit).

## What is the difference between Scaleway and custom data?

[Scaleway data](#scaleway-data) is collected automatically from Scaleway products, while [custom data](#custom-data) is manually pushed from your own sources.

### Scaleway data

Scaleway data is the observability data (metrics and/or logs) that is natively collected by all [Scaleway products integrated with Cockpit](/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-limitations/#product-integration-into-cockpit).

### Custom data

Custom data refers to any metrics, logs, or traces that you manually push to Cockpit. This can include data from applications hosted at Scaleway or any other platform.

## Where does Cockpit store data?

### Scaleway data

Cockpit stores Scaleway data in the same region as the Scaleway resource that produces it:

- Metrics and logs collected from a Scaleway resource are stored in that region’s data source as **Scaleway Metrics** or **Scaleway Logs**.

- You cannot configure a different region for where this automatically collected data is stored.

### Custom data

In order for Cockpit to store your custom data, you must first [create a custom data source](/cockpit/how-to/create-external-data-sources/) in a region of your choice. The data you send will then be stored in that custom data source’s region and not replicated across other regions.

Even though data is region-bound, your Cockpit Grafana instance can query and visualize data across all regions where you have data sources.

If you are using Scaleway’s preconfigured dashboards in Grafana, make sure you have selected the region of the resource you want to monitor using the drop-down at the top of the dashboard. This filters the dashboards to only show data from the matching regional data source.

## How am I billed for using Cockpit with my Scaleway data?

Scaleway data is collected and available in Cockpit for free.

Retention is also free as long as it stays within the default period: 31 days for metrics and 7 days for logs.
You can [adjust the retention period](/cockpit/how-to/change-data-retention) from 1 day (for logs) or 31 days (for metrics) to 1 year. Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/cockpit/concepts/#retention) for more information on available retention periods. However, starting May 1, 2025, data stored beyond the default period will incur charges based on daily storage volume.

## How am I billed for using Cockpit with custom data?

Sending custom data to Cockpit incurs ingestion costs.

Retention of custom data is free within the default period: 31 days for custom metrics and 7 days for custom logs and traces. You can [adjust the retention period](/cockpit/how-to/change-data-retention) from 1 day to 1 year. However, starting May 1, 2025, data stored beyond the default period will be charged based on daily storage volume.

Ingestion of custom data is billed as follows:

- Custom metrics are billed €0.15 per million samples of metrics ingested
- Custom logs are billed €0.35 per GB ingested
- Custom traces are billed €0.35 per GB ingested

Scaleway applies volume discounts to bill custom metrics. This means that the monthly pricing for custom metrics will be calculated in levels. **Scaleway applies six levels of volume discounts.**

| Levels       | Range                                        | Monthly pricing with volume discounts    |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Level one    | From 0 to 10 billion custom metrics          | €0.15 per million samples                |
| Level two    | From 10 to 25 billion custom metrics         | €0.13 per million samples                |
| Level three  | From 25 to 50 billion custom metrics         | €0.12 per million samples                |
| Level four   | From 50 to 100 billion custom metrics        | €0.11 per million samples                |
| Level five   | From 100 to 200 billion custom metrics       | €0.10 per million samples                |
| Level six    | From 200 billion custom metrics and beyond   | €0.08 per million samples                |


Here is an example of how you would be billed for **sending 52 billion custom metrics samples per month**:

- 10 billion samples at €0.15 per million samples: €1.500
- 15 billion samples at €0.13 per million samples: €1.950
- 25 billion samples at €0.12 per million samples: €3.000
- 2 billion samples at €0.11 per million samples: €220

**Total:** €6.670 per month with volume discounts instead of €7.800 without volume discounts.

Refer to our [documentation on understanding and managing Cockpit ingestion to reduce costs](/cockpit/reference-content/understanding-cockpit-usage/) for more information on how to reduce extra costs when ingesting custom data.

## How am I billed for increasing data retention period?

All ingested data, whether from Scaleway or custom sources, is retained for free within the default periods:
- Metrics: 31 days
- Logs and traces: 7 days

**Starting May 1, 2025, data retained beyond these periods will be charged** based on daily storage volume:

- Metrics: €0.0002 per 10 million samples/day
- Logs and traces: €0.002 per GB/day

If you delete your data source or reduce its retention period below the default value, data will be deleted and you will no longer be charged for extended retention.

<Concept>
  ## See custom retention pricing examples
  ### For 10 days of retention
  If you ingest an average of **2GB of logs daily** and increase retention to **10 days**. Retention is free for the first **7 days**, so you are only charged for the extra **3 days**:

  **Monthly estimated cost:**
    `retention_cost` = 2 GB x (10 - 7) x 0.002€ x 30 days = 0.36€/month

  ### For 90 days of retention
  If you extend retention to **90 days**, you are charged for the extra **83 days** beyond the free period:
  **Monthly estimated cost:**
   `retention_cost` = 2 GB x (90 - 7) x 0.002€ x 30 days = 9.96€/month
</Concept>

## Why are Cockpit pricing plans being deprecated?

From January 1st 2025, Cockpit is transitioning away from fixed pricing plans to offer you more flexibility and granularity for managing data [retention](/cockpit/concepts/#retention).

This change allows you to tailor retention settings to your specific needs and only be charged for the volume of data you effectively store.

Find out [how to change data retention period](/cockpit/how-to/change-data-retention/) in the dedicated documentation.

## How do I send my own data to my Cockpit?

If you have set up an agent, you can send your data using our [dedicated documentation](/cockpit/how-to/send-metrics-logs-to-cockpit/).

If you have not set up an agent, check out our [documentation](/cockpit/how-to/send-metrics-with-grafana-alloy/) to find out how to
configure the Grafana Alloy agent, push your data, and visualize it in Grafana.

<Message type="important">
Sending metrics and logs using an external path is a billable feature. Any data that you push yourself is considered as "custom" and is billed, even if you collect that data from Scaleway products. Refer to the [product pricing](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/?tags=available,managedservices-observability-cockpit) for more information.
