## LoRaWAN© and Actility Overview

LoRaWAN© is a low-power, low-bandwidth, long-range radio protocol used by many devices to send their data over the air. This protocol is specifically designed for battery powered devices with little to no installation cost.

LoRaWAN© devices broadcast their data to reachable LoRaWAN© gateways, which forward the messages on the LoRaWAN© operator network. The operator de-duplicates the messages from multiple gateways and hand over the message to the "LoRaWAN© application". In our scenario, the "LoRaWAN© application" is Scaleway IoT Hub.

[Actility](https://www.actility.com) is a LoRaWAN© operator which can build a public or private LoRaWAN© network.

In this tutorial we are going to:

- Create a IoT Hub which to receive/send messages from/to LoRaWAN© devices
- Add a Device to the Hub to prepare the Actility-to-Scaleway connection
- Set up the Actility backend to use the Device credentials to establish a connection with IoT Hub
- Add another Device and connect it as a subscribe to receive LoRaWAN© messages

## Create an IoT Hub

First, we need a Hub. Its role will be to distribute messages from your LoRaWAN© devices to the intended targets. Please follow [this procedure](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/create-hub) to create an IoT Hub if you don't have one already. The hub's name and plan does not matter for this tutorial.

## Create an IoT Device

The Actility platform will connect as a MQTT device to exchange data on IoT Hub. This means that we need to add a Device to the IoT Hub. Please follow [this procedure](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/add-device) to create a device.

<Message type="note">

- The device name is not important for this tutorial.
- Keep the default `Deny Insecure` connections setting to provide maximum security.

</Message>

Once done, copy the `Device ID` and download the `certificate` & `private key` files, you will need them to set up the Actility backend.

## Set up the Actility backend

Now IoT Hub is ready to exchange messages with Actility, let's configure the Actility side:

1. Go to your [Actility Thingpark Enterprise console](https://community.thingpark.io/).

2. Click `Applications > Create` and choose MQTT.

3. Fill in the following parameters (unlisted settings can be anything you like):

    - **Hostname**: Your IoT Hub Endpoint, followed by MQTTs port (ex: `iot.fr-par.scw.cloud:8883`).
    - **Account prefix**: This allows you to set the MQTT topic prefix. Messages will be published with a topic like `<prefix>/things/<LoRaWAN device ID>/uplink`. Type in `my-app` here.
    - **Protocol**: `SSL`.
    - **MQTT Username**: Your IoT Hub Device ID.
    - **MQTT Password**: Leave empty.
    - **Certificate**: the device certificate file (ex: `my-device-crt.pem`).
    - **Private Key**: the device key file (ex: `my-device-key.pem`).

4. Click the Save button.

You can check the application is up and running by going to the application page and verifying the `Deployment Status` box is set to `Opened`. When it is, your LoRaWAN© network is now connected to your IoT Hub.

## Verify the we have done things right

It is time to see messages flowing on IoT Hub:

  - Create another IoT Hub Device, but this time choose the `Allow Insecure` connections setting. Secured connections are not supported over Web Sockets, which the `MQTT Webclient` uses.
  - On the Device page, click the `MQTT Webclient` button. The client will open and automatically connect.

  - Now subscribe to the LoRaWAN© devices messages:
    - Click `Add New Topic Subscription` in the `Subscriptions` block
    - Pick any color to identify this subscription
    - Leave QoS 0
    - Use `my-app/things/+/uplink` as the topic, this will instruct IoT Hub to send you uplink messages from all devices
    - Click subscribe

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-mqtt_webclient_2.png" alt="" />

  - Your subscription now appears in the `Subscriptions` block and the messages from your LoRa devices will start showing in the `Messages` block.

Congratulations! Messages are flowing as expected.

## Going further

You could leverage the power of IoT Hub to build a dashboard to display your data in a few easy steps:

- [Start a PostgreSQL managed DB instance](/storage/database/how-to/create-a-database/) and create a `lora` table with the following fields: `time` (timestamp type) and `data` (jsonb type)
- Configure a Database Route to push data in there, [see how to](/storage/database/how-to/create-a-database/). The topic filter should be `my-app/things/+/uplink`. Your query should look like `INSERT INTO lora (time, data) VALUES (NOW(), $PAYLOAD)`.
- Start a [new Scaleway instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance) and setup Grafana, get inspiration from [this tutorial](/tutorials/visualize-timeseries-data-timescaledb-grafana) (steps 1 to 14, don't enable TimescaleDB option).
- Add widgets to your dashboard, for a graph your query could look like `SELECT time, data->'DevEUI_uplink'->'payload'->'batteryLevel' as batteryLevel FROM lora WHERE $__timeFilter(time)`.

That's it! Your LoRaWAN© devices data is now backed by a production-grade dashboard!
