It is now possible to create [SQS and NATS triggers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/serverless/functions/how-to/add-trigger-to-a-function/) on private functions.

<Message type="note">
  For now, changing the privacy of a function from public to private will require you to delete and recreate the existing triggers.
