Scaleway offers a range of ready-to-use AI Docker images. These Docker images can be used with all GPU Instance OS images.

You can pull the images from our Container Registry as follows:

```sh
docker pull rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/scw-ai/<IMAGE:TAG>
```

Our tag names follow the pattern `:YYMM-py3`, where `YY` and `MM` refer to the year and month the image was built. One exception to this is the tag used for the Tensorflow image, which is `:YYMM-tf2-py3`.

The latest images are also tagged with the `:latest` tag.

Initial tags will start with 2204-py3 (April 2022). Check out the [Scaleway Changelog](https://www.scaleway.com/en/changelog/) to be informed of Docker AI images updates.

All our images are based on CUDA 11.2 and cuDNN8.

  When using the “Ubuntu Focal GPU OS 11” image with your Instance, you can omit the *nvidia runtime* option

The following commands show how to launch a container based on each of our various Docker images:

## Tensorflow

```sh
docker run --runtime=nvidia -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/scw-ai/tensorflow:latest /bin/bash
```

The main libraries included in the Tensorflow image are: Tensorflow 2, Tensorboard, Autokeras, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Bokeh, Seaborn, CatBoost, XGBoost, Pillow, ONNX, Spacy, Nvidia Dali, Optuna, HuggingFace Transformers and HuggingFace-Hub, Weights and Biases, JupyterLab, Code Server and JupyterLab Nvidia Dashboard.

## Pytorch

```sh
docker run --runtime=nvidia -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/scw-ai/pytorch:latest /bin/bash
```

The main libraries included  in the Pytorch image are: Pytorch, Torch Audio, Torch Vision, Fast AI, Pytorch Lightning, Tensorboard, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Bokeh, Seaborn, CatBoost, XGBoost, Pillow, Plotly, ONNX, Spacy, Nvidia Dali, Optuna, HuggingFace Transformers and HuggingFace-Hub, Weights and Biases, JupyterLab, Code Server and JupyterLab Nvidia Dashboard.


## Jax

```sh
docker run --runtime=nvidia -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/scw-ai/jax:latest /bin/bash
```

The main libraries included in the Jax image are: Jax, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Bokeh, Seaborn, CatBoost, XGBoost, Pillow, ONNX, JupyterLab, Code Server and JupyterLab Nvidia Dashboard.

## RAPIDS

Note: This image is built on top of the official RAPIDS Docker image, which relies on Anaconda.

```sh
docker run --runtime=nvidia -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/scw-ai/rapids:latest /bin/bash

```

The main libraries included in the RAPIDS image are: cuDF, cuML, cuGraph, cuxfilter, cuspatial, cusignal, Dask, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Bokeh, Seaborn, CatBoost, XGBoost, Pillow, ONNX, JupyterLab and JupyterLab Nvidia Dashboard.


<Message type="note">
  As the official RAPIDS Docker image uses Anaconda, make sure the "rapids" conda environment is activated in order to use Rapids libraries:

  ```
  jovyan@561f14e37a44:~/ai$ conda activate rapids
  (rapids) jovyan@561f14e37a44:~/ai$ jupyter lab
  ```
</Message>

## "All" (Experimental)

If there are no dependency issues when buidling the image, the **all** image will try to include all the above listed libraries into a single Docker image (except RAPIDS)

```sh
docker run --runtime=nvidia -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/scw-ai/all:latest /bin/bash
```
