### How long is my server contract?
You are on a monthly contract, the billing cycle is always from the first to the last day of each month. When placing an order, you will be billed pro rata for the current month, except if you are paying using SEPA direct debit. In this case, your first invoice will be issued during your first complete month and includes the pro rata amount for the current month in addition to the next full month.

### What is your policy regarding IP addresses?
Public IPv4 addresses have become a rare and expensive resource. Each dedicated server is provided with a public IPv4 address at no extra cost. Additional addresses are available for an additional charge with the “IP Failover” option.

### How is the price of my server calculated?
Our prices are updated daily based on demand, available stocks, component, and energy market prices. Some components, such as RAM memory and SSD disks, have high volatility. Do not worry, the price at the time of order is guaranteed for the first 12 months of your subscription.
