Once you have set up your Dedibox server, installed an operating system, and connected via SSH, you are ready to begin. This guide provides essential information and tips for efficiently using your Dedibox server.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- [Created](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/order-a-server/) and [installed](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/install-a-server/) a dedicated server

## Using the shell

Dedibox servers do not come with a graphical interface by default. Instead, all commands are executed via a powerful shell/terminal. The shell allows you to:

- Install, configure, and manage software
- Create, edit, and delete files and directories
- Configure server settings

You can [connect to the shell via SSH](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/connect-to-server/#how-to-connect-via-ssh). For essential commands, refer to our [basic Linux commands guide](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/reference-content/basic-linux-commands/).

## Using a graphical desktop

If you prefer a graphical interface, you can install a desktop-oriented distribution and connect using the X2Go Client. For more information, refer to our [guide on connecting via Windows Remote Desktop](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/connect-to-server/#how-to-connect-via-remote-desktop).

## Installing software on Linux OSes

After setting up your Dedibox, only the operating system and an SSH server are installed. To add software, use a package manager specific to your distribution:

- **Debian/Ubuntu**: Use the APT package manager. See our guide on [getting started with APT](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/manage-packages/).
- **CentOS/RHEL**: Use [DNF](https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (previously YUM for CentOS 7 and older).
- **SuSE Linux**: Use [YAST](https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP2/html/SLES-all/cha-yast-software.html).

Package managers allow you to install, update, and remove software directly from the shell.

## Backing up your Dedibox

As the server owner, you are responsible for your data. Regular backups are strongly recommended. You can order a Dedibackup option with various disk sizes for secure FTP storage of your backups. Tools like [Backup Manager](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/oracular/en/man8/backup-manager.8.html) can help you automate the backup process.
