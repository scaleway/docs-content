Unmounting a volume means detaching it from the operating system so it is no longer accessible. You can do this if you want to stop using it, prevent data corruption, or plan to [detach it](/block-storage/how-to/detach-a-volume/) from your Instance and attach it to another. This page shows you how to unmount a volume from the operating system using the `umount` command.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created an [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- Created an [Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) with an additional Block Storage volume


1. Open a terminal and use the following command to connect to your Instance. Make sure that you replace `<your_instance_ip>` with your Instance's IP. You can also find the SSH command in your Instance's **Overview** tab in the Scaleway console.
    ```
    ssh root@<your_instance_ip>
    ```
2. Use `lsblk` to check where your volume is mounted. You should see an output similar to the following:

    ```
    root@scw-heuristic-shtern:~# lsblk
    NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
    sdb       8:0    0 18.6G  0 disk /mnt/block-volume
    ```
3. Unmount the volume to remove it from your current setup. Replace `/mnt/block-volume` with your mount point.
    ```
    umount /mnt/block-volume
    ```
4.  Check that the volume is no longer mounted in the system with `lsblk`.
    ```
    root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# lsblk
    NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    sdb       8:0    0 18.6G  0 disk
    ```
    <Message type="important">
      Do not forget to edit the `/etc/fstab` file and delete the line corresponding to your block volume.
