Routes allow you to specify, for a given frontend, which backends it should direct traffic to depending on the requested host. For [HTTP](/load-balancer/concepts/#protocol) frontends/backends, routes are based on HTTP Host headers or URL paths. For [TCP](/load-balancer/concepts/#protocol) frontends/backends, they are based on **S**erver **N**ame **I**dentification (SNI). You can configure multiple routes on a single frontend. When no route rules match for an incoming connection/request, the frontend will forward to its default backend.

## How to create routes

1. Click **Load Balancers** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. A listing of your Load Balancers displays.

2. Use the **region selector** at the top of the page to filter for the region of the Load Balancer you want to configure, then click the Load Balancer in the listing. 

3. Click the **Frontends** tab.

4. Click the frontend you want to create a route on.

5. Click the **Routes** tab.

6. Click <Icon name="plus" /> **Create route** to create a new route.

7. Enter the following information to configure the route:
    - **Source frontend**: The current frontend is pre-set.
    - **Target backend**: Select the backend to which the frontend should direct traffic to for this rule.

    If you have selected an HTTP frontend/backend pair:

    - **HTTP Host header**: Enter an HTTP Host header value to filter for (for example `example-domain.com`). Traffic with a matching value in its HTTP Host header will be directed to the specified target backend, OR
    - **URL path**: Enter a URL path value to filter for (for example `/dashboard`)

    If you have selected a TCP frontend/backend pair:

    - **SNI value**: Enter an SNI value to filter for (for example `example-domain.com`). Traffic with a matching SNI value will be directed to the specified target backend.

8. Choose whether to match all subdomains of the given SNI / Host header value, by checking the relevant box. This will ensure that all requests to subdomains of the value (e.g. `blog.example-domain.com`) also use this route.

9. Click **Create route** to finish.

  Your route is created, and you are taken to the list of all your routes for this Load Balancer.

  You can repeat this process to create as many routes as you want.

## How to edit routes

1. Click **Load Balancers** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. A listing of your Load Balancers displays.

2. Use the **region selector** at the top of the page to filter for the region of the Load Balancer you want to configure, then click the Load Balancer in the listing.

3. Click the **Frontends** tab.

4. Click the frontend you want to edit a route on.

5. Click the **Routes** tab.

6. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the route you want to edit, and select **Edit** from the drop-down list.

7. Edit the backend and/or SNI/HTTP Host header value as required.

8. Click **Edit route** to finish.

  Your route is edited, and you are returned to the list of routes.

## How to delete routes

1. Click **Load Balancers** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. A listing of your Load Balancers displays.

2. Use the **region selector** at the top of the page to filter for the region of the Load Balancer you want to configure, then click the Load Balancer in the listing. 

3. Click the **Frontends** tab.

4. Click the frontend you want to delete routes on.

5. Click the **Routes** tab.

6. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the route you want to delete, and select **Delete**.

7. Confirm the action by clicking **Delete route**.
