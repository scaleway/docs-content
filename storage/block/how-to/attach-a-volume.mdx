You can attach a Block Storage volume to your Instance at any time.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created a [Block Storage volume](/storage/block/how-to/create-a-volume/)
- At least one [Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/)


1. Click **Block Storage** in the **Storage** section of the Scaleway console side menu. Your volumes display.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Attach to Instance** next to the volume of your choice. A pop-up displays.
3. Select the Instance to which you want to attach your volume from the drop-down.
4. Click **Attach volume to Instance**.

Alternatively, you can attach a Block Storage volume the following way:

1. Click **Block Storage** in the **Storage** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The Block Storage page displays.
2. Click **Attach an Instance** under the **Linked Instance** section.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-block-storage-attach-instance.webp" alt="" />
3. Select the Instance to which you want to attach your volume from the drop-down.
4. Click **Attach volume to Instance**.

<Message type="important">
  You can attach up to 15 volumes at a time to a single Instance.
</Message>
<Message type="note">
  To use **[Block Storage Low Latency](/storage/block/) 15k**, your Instance must have at least **3 Gbps of block bandwidth**.
  Check if an Instance type meets this requirement by referring to the `block_bandwidth` field in the [Instances API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/#path-instance-types-list-instance-types) at `/instance/v1/zones/{zone}/products/servers`.
  This field provides information about the block bandwidth for each Instance type to ensure compatibility with high-performance storage.
