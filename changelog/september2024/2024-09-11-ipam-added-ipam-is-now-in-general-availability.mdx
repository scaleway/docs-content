[IP Address Manager (IPAM)](/network/ipam/quickstart/) offers several different functionalities in the Scaleway console such as viewing, tagging and filtering private IP addresses. Users can also reserve a private IP on one of their Private Networks and use it to attach an Instance, Load Balancer or Public Gateway to the network.
