You can enable two-factor authentication on your Scaleway account for heightened security. Once enabled, an additional security code, generated by your phone, is required to access your account. 

Two-factor authentication provides an extra layer of security. As well as your password (the first factor), a second factor (the 2FA app) is required to gain access to your account. Even in case of leaked password, your account is protected by this second layer of security.

## How to download a 2FA app

To use two-factor authentication on your account, you first need to download a 2FA app onto your smartphone. Once configured, 2FA apps display a constantly rotating set of codes to use with your different accounts when you are prompted for one at log in. Popular 2FA apps include:
- [Authy](https://authy.com/download/)
- [FreeOTP](https://freeotp.github.io/)
- [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en&gl=US)

Download the app of your choice and install it onto your smartphone.

## How to enable 2FA

1. Click to open the Organization drop-down menu in the top-right corner of the console, and select **My Profile**.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-org-dropdown-myprofile.webp" alt="" />

2. Scroll to the bottom of your profile page, and click **Enable 2FA**. A pop-up displays.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-2FA-popup-1.webp" alt="" />

3. Enter the code shown on the popup into your 2FA app, or alernatively, scan the QR code into your app. 

  Your app sets up 2FA for your Scaleway account, and displays a 6-digit code.

4. Enter the 6-digit code given by your app into the pop-up box, and click **Submit**. A pop-up displays:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-2FA-popup-2.webp" alt="" />

5. Download or copy the backup codes shown, and save them in a safe place. These codes will be the only way you can regain access to your account without your 2FA app. 

2FA is now enabled. Next time you log in to your Scaleway account, you will be prompted for a 2FA code. Use your 2FA app to get the code and enter it into the Scaleway console.

## How to disable 2FA

1. Click to open the Organization drop-down menu in the top-right corner of the console, and select **My Profile**.

2. Scroll to the bottom of the page, and click **Disable 2FA**. A pop-up displays.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-2FA-disable.webp" alt="" />

3. Type **DISABLE** in the box to confirm, and click **Disable**

## How to regain access to your account

### If you lose your 2FA device

If you lose your 2FA device, you can use the backup codes that were generated when you activated 2FA to regain access.

When you log into your account, you are prompted for a 2FA code:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-2FA-login.webp" alt="" />

Enter one of your backup codes (instead of a code generated by your 2FA device in real-time) and click **Send token**. You are logged into your account, and can disable 2FA if you wish by [following the instructions above](#how-to-disable-2FA).

### If you lose your 2FA device and your backup codes

If you lose both your 2FA device and your backup codes, it is more difficult to regain access to your account. You will need to go through a manual identity verification process.

The only way to regain access to your account is to contact our support team with the following information:
 
  * Email address
  * Postal address
  * Two different documents proving your identity (passport or local ID card for individual accounts + certificate of incorporation for companies)
  * A contact phone number
  * A copy of your last Scaleway invoice, or details about the amount charged if you don’t have a copy
  * A card or bank statement showing your Scaleway invoice debit

Once you have collected all this information, send it to [document@scaleway.com](mailto:document@scaleway.com).
