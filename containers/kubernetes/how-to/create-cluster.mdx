Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule provides a managed environment for you to create, configure and run a cluster of preconfigured machines for containerized applications. You will be able to create [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) clusters without the complexity of managing the infrastructure.

The service offers full flexibility such as:
  * Scaling the number of pods depending on the workload.
  * Managing your cluster easily via the [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/)

To administrate your Kubernetes Cluster easily, Scaleway provides a `.kubeconfig` file that allows you to manage your cluster from your local computer by using `kubectl`. [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) is the command line interface for running commands against Kubernetes clusters.

This document concerns the creation and management of a **Kubernetes Kapsule** cluster. To create a Kubernetes Kosmos Cluster, refer to the [alternative documentation](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-kosmos-cluster)

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Compute** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Kubernetes Kapsule dashboard displays.
2. Click **Create a cluster**. The first page of the cluster creation wizard displays. This concerns the configuration of your cluster.
3. Complete the following steps of the wizard:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-choose-cluster-type.webp" alt="" />    
    
    * Choose a **Cluster Type**. This can be Kubernetes Kapsule or Kubernetes Kosmos.
      * **Kubernetes Kapsule** allows you to create clusters exclusively of Scaleway Instances, and includes features such as node auto-healing and pool auto-scaling.
      * **Kubernetes Kosmos** allows you to attach an Instance or dedicated server from any Cloud provider to a Scaleway Kubernetes control plane.
    * The geographical **region** of the cluster.
    * The Kubernetes **version** for the cluster
    * The **name** for the cluster and optionally a description
    * If required, configure **advanced options**, including the container network interface, the ingress controller and cluster tags, which can help you to organize your cluster. Keep the default settings if you don't know what these values mean
4. Click **Next**. The second page of the cluster creation wizard displays. 
5. This page concerns the settings for your pool. Enter the following information:
    * The **availability zone** in which all your pool's nodes will be created
    * The **node type** you require
    * The configuration for your **node options**, including the number of nodes and whether to enable autoscale. You can also choose whether to enable autoheal and whether to link the cluster to a placement group. Alternatively, you can leave these options at default values
6. Click **Create a cluster**

    Your cluster is deployed

Once your cluster is created, it appears in the Clusters List.
