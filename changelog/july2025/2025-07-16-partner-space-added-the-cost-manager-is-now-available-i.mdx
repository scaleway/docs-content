The Partners can now consult the consumptions of their clients directly in the Console, in a new Partner space section called “Billing”.

They can filter by:
Client - The customer organization name is displayed in the selector.
Period - Currently you can filter by year.
Category - The product category (e.g. Compute, Storage, Containers). Each category corresponds to a different color in the consumption chart and in the detailed list.
Product - The product itself. The consumption shown is the sum of all the products of the same type.
