AI-driven coding is revolutionizing software development by automating repetitive tasks, generating code snippets, improving code quality, and identifying potential bugs. 
By integrating AI-powered tools, developers can significantly enhance productivity and optimize workflows. 
This guide will help you integrating AI-powered code models into JetBrain's IntelliJ IDEA using Continue and Scaleway’s Generative APIs.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) for API authentication
- Installed [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) on your local machine.

## Install Continue in IntelliJ IDEA

You can install Continue from [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22707-continue):

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA and go to **Preferences** (`Ctrl+Alt+S` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+,` on macOS).
2. Navigate to **Plugins** > **Marketplace**.
3. Search for **Continue** and click **Install**.
4. Restart IntelliJ IDEA after installation.

### Configure Continue to use Scaleway’s Generative APIs

To link Continue with Scaleway’s Generative APIs, you need to configure the settings file:

1. Locate your Continue configuration directory:
   - **Linux/macOS**: `~/.continue/`
   - **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.continue\`
2. Create a `config.json` file inside this directory.
3. Add the following configuration:
    ```json
    {
    "models": [
        {
        "model": "qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct",
        "title": "Qwen2.5 Coder",
        "provider": "scaleway",
        "apiKey": "###SCW_SECRET_KEY###"
        }
    ]
    }
    ```
4. Save the file and restart IntelliJ IDEA.

### Activate Continue in IntelliJ IDEA

After configuring the API, activate Continue in IntelliJ IDEA:

- Open the **Command Search** (`Shift+Shift` on Windows/Linux/macOS).
- Type `"Continue"` and select the appropriate command to enable AI-powered assistance.

## Using Continue for AI-powered coding

Once Continue is configured, you can leverage AI capabilities to streamline development. Below are some key features:

### AI-assisted code generation

Use the **Continue: Generate Code** command to generate boilerplate code, functions, or even entire classes based on natural language prompts.

#### Example:

- Input Prompt: *"Create a Java method to validate an email address."*
- AI-generated output:
    ```java
    import java.util.regex.Pattern;

    public class EmailValidator {
        private static final String EMAIL_REGEX = "^[A-Za-z0-9+_.-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+$";
        private static final Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(EMAIL_REGEX);

        public static boolean isValidEmail(String email) {
            return pattern.matcher(email).matches();
        }
    }
    ```

### Intelligent code completion

Continue enhances your coding workflow with AI-driven code completion. Simply start typing, and the AI model will suggest and complete your code efficiently.

### Automated code refactoring

Refactoring is crucial for maintaining clean and efficient code. Use the *Continue: Refactor Code* command to enhance readability and optimize performance.

#### Example

- Before refactoring:
    ```java
    public int calculateSum(int a, int b) {
        int result = a + b;
        return result;
    }
    ```

- After AI-driven refactoring:
    ```java
    public int calculateSum(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    ```

## Conclusion

By integrating Continue with Scaleway’s Generative APIs, you unlock AI-powered coding capabilities that enhance productivity, automate repetitive tasks, and improve code quality.
