The image feature lets you create an image of your Instance, which contains all its volumes. You can use this image not only to restore your Instance and its data, but also to create a series of Instances with a predefined configuration. 

This feature is available on Instance types. Creating images of your Instance is free. However, keep in mind that as the image feature creates snapshots of your volumes, you will be billed for these snapshots.

<Message type="note">
  This creates an image which is a complete backup of your Instance including **all** of its volumes. The [snapshot](/compute/instances/concepts/#snapshot) feature, on the other hand, creates snapshots of specific volumes. Consider [creating a snapshot](/compute/instances/how-to/create-a-snapshot/) if you want to use different snapshot strategies for different volumes of your Instance, e.g., if it has one volume containing the OS and another containing application data.

## How to create or restore an Instance from an image

There are two different ways to create a new Instance from your image:

### Using the Instance creation wizard

Follow the instructions for [creating an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance). At the **Choose an image** step of the creation wizard, click the **My images** tab, and select the desired image.

A new Instance is created from your image.


### Restoring the image

6. Finish configuring the Instance according to your requirements, and click **Create Instance**.

    A new Instance is created from your image.
