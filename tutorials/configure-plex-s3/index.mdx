## Plex - Overview

[Plex](https://www.plex.tv) is client/server media player system comprising two main components:

- The **Plex Server** application, that is available for Windows, macOS, Linux and even including some NAS devices.
- **Plex clients** that can be either a web-based interface, an application on smart TVs, streaming boxes or other third-party applications.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your SSH key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
  - You have a [Scaleway Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) running Ubuntu Focal Fossa (20.04 LTS)
  - You have created an [Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)
  - You have sudo privileges or access to the root user.
</Message>

## Installing the required software

1. Connect to your Instance using SSH.
    ```
    ssh root@<your-instance-IP>
    ```
2. Update the apt package manager and the software already installed on the system:
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
3. Add the Plex repository:

    Add Plex's GPG key to the apt sources keychain and create a new file containing an entry to the Plex repository by running the following commands:
    ```
    curl https://downloads.plex.tv/plex-keys/PlexSign.key | apt-key add -
    echo deb https://downloads.plex.tv/repo/deb public main | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/plexmediaserver.list
    ```
4. Install Plex and s3fs:

    Now, as the Plex repository is enabled, update the apt package list and install the latest version of Plex and s3fs, which is needed to mount the Object Storage bucket.
    ```
    apt update 
    apt install -y plexmediaserver s3fs
    ```

### Configuring s3fs

1. Create the folder on which you will mount the bucket.
    ```
    mkdir -p /mnt/media
    ```
2. Enter your API keys in the password file and set owner-only permissions.
    ```
    echo $ACCESS_KEY:$SECRET_KEY >  ~/.passwd-s3fs
    chmod 600  ~/.passwd-s3fs
    ```
3. Uncomment `user_allow_other` in the `/etc/fuse.conf` file to allow other users to access the server. You can use a text editor of your choice. In this tutorial we use `nano`.
    ```
    nano /etc/fuse.conf
      [...]
      user_allow_other
    ```
4. Mount the bucket in the local filesystem.
    ```
    s3fs plexmediaserver /mnt/media -o allow_other -o umask=0002 -o passwd_file=${HOME}/.passwd-s3fs -o url=https://s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud
    ```
    <Message type="note">
      Replace `plexmediaserver` with the name of your bucket and `nl-ams` with the region of your bucket, if necessary.
    </Message>
5. (Optional) To mount the bucket automatically during boot, create a [systemd](/tutorials/systemd-essentials/) script, called `/etc/systemd/user/s3fs.service`:
    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=S3FS mounts
    Wants=network-online.target
    After=network-online.target

    [Service]
    Type=oneshot
    RemainAfterExit=yes
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/s3fs plexmediaserver /mnt/media -o allow_other -o umask=0002 -o passwd_file=${HOME}/.passwd-s3fs -o url=https://s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud
    ExecStop=/bin/fusermount -u /mnt/media

    [Install]
    WantedBy=default.target
    ```
6. Enable the script by running the following commands:
    ```
    systemctl --user enable s3fs.service
    systemctl --user start s3fs.service
    ```

    If you ever want to disable the automatic mounting, run the following command:

    ```
    systemctl --user stop s3fs.service
    ```

### Configuring Plex

1. Check that Plex is running before continuing:
    ```
    systemctl status plexmediaserver.service
    ```

    The output should look like this example:

    ```
    ● plexmediaserver.service - Plex Media Server for Linux
      Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/plexmediaserver.service; enabled; vendor
      Active: active (running) since Sun 2018-09-23 14:16:52 UTC; 1min 53s ago
      Process: 882 ExecStartPre=/bin/sh -c /usr/bin/test -d "${PLEX_MEDIA_SERVER_APP
    Main PID: 889 (sh)
    [...]
    ```

    If the status is `active (running)` everything is fine.
2. Access Plex interface through an SSH tunnel
    - On Linux or macOS computers, you can create the tunnel with the following command:
    ```
    ssh root@plex.server.ip -L 8888:localhost:32400
    ```
    - On Windows computers, you can create the tunnel by using [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/):
      - Open PuTTY, enter your server IP address in the hostname and SSH port. Or, if you already have your server session set up and saved, just load the existing session.
      - Go to **Connection** > **SSH** > **Tunnels**.
      - Fill in **Source port** as **8888** and **Destination** as **localhost:32400**.
      - Click the **Add** button.
      - Navigate back to the session homepage now and click the **Save** button, then **Open** to connect to the server.

    Open a web browser on your local computer and navigate to `http://localhost:8888/web`. The Plex login screen displays:

    <Message type="note">
      In order to use Plex, you must create an account.
    </Message>

    Once you are logged in, you will be automatically redirected to the setup of the server:
    
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-plex-server-setup.webp" alt="" />
3. Access Plex interface with your server IP address
    - Open a web browser on your local computer and navigate to `http://<plex.server.ip>:32400`
    - The Plex login screen should displays.

    <Message type="note">
      The port `32400` is the default used by Plex for the interface.
    </Message>
4. Enter the required parameters and click **Next** to complete the setup.
    <Message type="note">
      Make sure the Checkbox `Allow me to access my media outside my home` is ticked so you can access your media files from any device.
    </Message>
5. Click **Add a library** to create a new media gallery
6. Select the type of library you wish to create and click **Next**
7. Click **Browse and select a multimedia folder** to do so.
    - Plex recommends creating separate folders for each type of media. For example, if your library is about movies, create a folder `Movies` in your bucket, through the `/mnt/media` mounted folder or the Scaleway Console.
    - You should see the `Movies` folder inside Plex, in the browse window.
8. Select `/mnt/media/<Folder name>` as the media folder.

    <Message type="tip">
      You can upload additional content to your server with any S3 compatible tool, like [Cyberduck](/tutorials/store-s3-cyberduck/).
    </Message>
9. Click **Next** and then **Finish** to conclude the set up.
10. Add media to your bucket and trigger a scan of your media folder in the Plex interface. Your media should displays, if so, it's all set up!
