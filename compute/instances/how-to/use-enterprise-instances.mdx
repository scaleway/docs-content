This page gathers information about the creation, management and specificities of Scaleway Enterprise Instances. [Enterprise Instances](/compute/instances/concepts#enterprise-instance) are high-end Instances based on the AMD EPYC™ 7003 Series Processor. These Instances support the [boot-on-block](/compute/instances/concepts#boot-on-block) feature which allows them to boot from attached Block Storage volumes. Block Storage is fully backed by SSDs and comes with guaranteed IOPS for critical applications. All data on the Block Storage platform is replicated three times to ensure integrity. Your data is highly available and remains accessible even in case of a disk failure. 

Enterprise Instances come without local storage and you can add one or several Block Storage volumes depending on your requirements. The minimum size of a Block Storage volume is 10GB.

## How to create an Enterprise Instance

Follow the instructions for [creating an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance), ensuring you conform to the following:
- Select PAR 2 or PAR 3 as your **Availability Zone**. 
- Select one of these **Images**, which are compatible with Enterprise Instances:
  - **Ubuntu**: Focal, Bionic, Xenial
  - **Debian** Buster
  - **CentOS** 8
  - **Fedora** 32
  - **My images**: You can populate your own list of Instance templates, [created from a backup image](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/create-an-image-from-my-server/) of an existing Enterprise Instance.
  - **Snapshots**: You can recover an Enterprise Instance from a [snapshot](/storage/database/how-to/manage-snapshots/) of a previously saved block volume containing a compatible boot image.
- Select an **Enterprise** Instance as your Instance type 
- When configuring your **Block Storage** volumes, bear in mind the following:
  - You can attach one or several volumes to your Instance, depending on your requirements.
  - The minumum size for a Block Storage volume is 10 GB.
  - If several Block Storage volumes are connected to an Enterprise Instance, the first volume will contain the OS and is required to boot the Instance. You should not [detach](/storage/block/how-to/detach-a-volume) this first volume from your Instance in the future, to avoid any issues.

<Message type="note">

When choosing an image for your Enterprise Instance, be aware this Instance type is not compatible with:
  - InstantApps
  - Bootscripts, except for [Rescue Mode](/compute/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes#how-to-use-rescue-mode)

## How to connect to an Enterprise Instance

Follow the instructions for [connecting to an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance).

## How to back up an Enterprise Instance

Follow the instructions for [backing up data with snapshots](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/backup-your-data-with-snapshots/).

<Message type="note">

Snapshots created from a local volume `(l_ssd)` cannot be used to create an Enterprise Instance, as it only supports booting from block volume `(b_ssd)`.

## How to use Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV)

Enterprise Instances rely on the AMD EPYC™ 7003 series Processor, which provides the SEV feature. AMD SEV helps keep your Instance's data confidential, by encrypting the memory of the virtual machine. SEV does not require any changes to your application software, it is enabled in the hypervisor and in the image of the Enterprise Instance. More details on the SEV feature are available at the [AMD website](https://developer.amd.com/sev/).

You can check that SEV is activated on your Enterprise Instance by entering the following into its command line:

```
# dmesg | grep -i sev
```
<Message type="note">

- As the encryption is activated at the boot of the Instance, the boot time can take a few seconds more on larger Enterprise Instances.
- If the Instance is booted into Rescue Mode, SEV is disabled automatically.
