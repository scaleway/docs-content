The action to take depends on whether DHCP is enabled on your Public Gateway and set to advertise a default route (true by default).

If it isn't, disconnect the Instance from the private network, as there may be other factors impacting your Instance, like one of your Instances running a DHCP server

If it is, this is expected behavior as all the traffic towards your Instance now goes through the Public Gateway. To access your Instance using SSH, first create a static NAT association between a port of your public gateway (eg 2222) and the private IP assigned to your Instance, on the SSH port (22 by default). Then, SSH to the public gatewayâ€™s IP on port 2222.
