A Hub is the central piece to which Devices can connect to exchange messages, and by which they get access to cloud services.

Under the hood, a Hub acts as an MQTT broker, meaning devices use it to publish messages on topics or subscribe to them. Hub Routes allow Devices to push messages to other, non MQTT, services.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

1. Click **IoT Hub** in the **Integration Services** section of the side menu. If you do not have a hub already created, the product presentation is displayed.
2. Click **Create hub**. The hub creation wizard displays.

3. Enter a name for your hub and choose the geographical region to deploy your hub in.
4. Choose a product plan for your IoT Hub. Currently three product plans are available for hubs:
    * **Shared plan:** This is a cost-effective, straightforward plan. Good for proofs-of-concept or DIY projects. The price is kept low by sharing resources between users, but it is therefore forbidden to use MQTT features which require memory (no messages with `QoS1`, `QoS2`, `retained` and no anonymous devices). Although this plan does not limit the number of devices, you will be billed for devices exceeding the number allowed within the free tier.
    * **Dedicated Plan:** This plan offers dedicated resources for the hub, which means more predictable performances and full support of the MQTT protocol.
    * **High Availability (HA) Plan:** Not only are resources dedicated to the hub, but they are also replicated so that the broker is highly available. This setting is ideal for workloads that require greater robustness for their hub.
5. Click **Create** or **Create and add device**.

      If you want to add a first device to the hub, click **Create hub and add device** and add your device using our [documentation on how to add a device](/iot-hub/how-to/add-device/).
