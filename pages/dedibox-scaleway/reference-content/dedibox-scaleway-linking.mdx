This page provides information about the Dedibox and Scaleway account linking process, **deprecated as of October 28, 2025**.

Users who have completed the linking retain access to both consoles and may have slight variations in features and services, as stated in this documentation.

<Message type="important">
  Users who have linked their accounts **before October 28, 2025** can still access and manage them from both the Dedibox and Scaleway consoles. This page only regards users who have completed this process.

## What was the account linking process and its purpose?
The linking process was an initiative to allow **Dedibox** (Online.net) users to link their accounts to the **Scaleway** console. Once completed, it granted access to the Scaleway console, from where users could manage their Dedibox servers and associated services, whilst retaining access to the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net).

Users who have completed the linking process **before October 28, 2025** can still access and manage their services from both the Dedibox and Scaleway consoles.

## What is the difference between account linking and unification?
- **Account linking**: was a process available until **October 28, 2025**, where users who owned a Dedibox account were offered the possibility to link it to the Scaleway console. This allowed them to try the Scaleway console and benefit from a more modern environment, while retaining access to the console they were familiar with.

- **Dedibox and Scaleway account unification**: is the first part of an ongoing project to unify the experience, access, management, and usage of both consoles, offering a seamless, safer, and optimized experience. [Learn more about account unification](/dedibox-scaleway/faq/)

Both initiatives aim to provide users with the best possible experience, with the latter being a permanent change happening in stages.

## Billing and payment information

### I have linked my Dedibox and Scaleway accounts. Will there be any changes to my billing after the account unification?
You will continue to receive separate invoices for each product— one for Dedibox and one for Scaleway. However, all invoices will be paid using the same payment method.

Therefore, we ask you to ensure the default payment method registered in your Scaleway account is the one you wish to use to settle your future invoices for both services.

### Where can I find my Dedibox invoices following the account unification?
If you have previously linked your Dedibox and Scaleway accounts, you will still find all your invoices in the [Billing](https://console.scaleway.com/billing/payment) section of the Scaleway console.

### How can I access and manage my payment methods?
All your active Dedibox payment methods remain available in the Scaleway console. Remember that you must choose a unique default payment method to pay all your Scaleway and Dedibox invoices.

The definition of your default payment method applies the following rules:
  * **If you had SEPA as your preferred payment method in either your Dedibox or Scaleway**, this became your default payment method for both consoles.
  * **If you did not have SEPA as your preferred payment method in either account**, your registered credit card will be used as your default payment method for both consoles.
  * **If you use different credit cards for Dedibox and Scaleway**, the card registered with Scaleway becomes the default payment method for both consoles.

<Message type="important">
  If you have linked your accounts, you can only edit your payment information on the Scaleway console.

### What information is synchronized between the two consoles?
Your personal (first name, last name, email address, and phone number) and billing information (address and billing contact, and company name and VAT number— if any) is shared between Scaleway and Dedibox. You can edit it from the Scaleway console whenever necessary.
