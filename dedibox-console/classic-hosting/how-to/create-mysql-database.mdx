## Limitations

Databases are not hosted in the local storage of Webhosting services. 

However, to ensure the best performance of the SQL servers, we have defined limits for the sizes of the databases:

  - Maximum size of a table: 1 GB for all offers
  - Maximum number of tables in a database: 2 000 for all offers
  - Number of simultaneous requests: 3 requests for the PERSONAL offer, 50 requests for the PRO offer, 75 requests for the BUSINESS offer

<Message type="important">
  Databases that exceed these quotas are automatically blocked. You will not be able to add additional data or update them. Only the options to view and delete data remain active.
</Message>

If you reach these limits and are unable to use your database, you can connect to the MySQL shell in the administration interface to check the size of your databases and manage your data to reduce usage.
