Waypoint is an open-source tool developed by HashiCorp that focuses on simplifying the deployment and release workflows for applications.

The main goal of Waypoint is to abstract away the complexities of different deployment targets and provide a consistent interface for developers and operators.
It allows developers to deploy, manage, and observe their applications using a simple and declarative configuration file.
The tool works with Nomad, Kubernetes, ECS and many other platforms.

## Waypoint plugins for Scaleway

We provide plugins for Waypoint, that add support for Scaleway.
Currently, the only plugin available is `container`.

## Plugin installation

### From releases

1. [Download the zip](https://github.com/scaleway/waypoint-plugin-scaleway/releases) of the latest version for your architecture.
2. Unzip the plugin by running the following command: `unzip waypoint-plugin-scaleway-container_*.zip -d ~/.config/.waypoint/plugins/`

## Plugin usage

Add the following block to your Waypoint configuration to use the Scaleway plugin.

```
deploy {
  use "scaleway-container" {
    port = 80
    namespace_id = "<YOUR_SCALEWAY_NAMESPACE_ID>"
    region = "fr-par"
  }
}
```

3. Initialize a new Terraform project.
    ```
    terraform init
    ```
4. Create a Kubernetes cluster and container namespace.
    ```
    terraform apply
    ```
5. Run the setup script to install a Waypoint server and automatically complete the `waypoint.hcl` configuration file with your container namespace informations.
    ```
    ./setup.sh
    ```
6. Run the following command to connect to the Waypoint user interface.
    ```
    waypoint ui -authenticate
    ```
    <Message type="tip">
      If you run the application on a server, open the web UI address returned by setup script and authenticate manually.
