Scaleway allows you to create jobs from external public [container registries](/containers/container-registry/concepts/#registry), such as Docker Hub, AWS container registries, GitLab container registry, etc.

1. Click **Jobs** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The jobs page displays.

2. Click **Create job**. The job creation wizard displays.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Select the **external** container registry.
    - Enter the public container image URL provided by the external registry, such as `docker.io/alpine:latest`.
    - Enter a name, or use the automatically generated one. The name can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes.
    - Select the region in which your job will be created.
    - Choose the **resources** to be allocated to your job at runtime. These define the performance characteristics of your job.
    - Optionally, add a **cron schedule** in the `* * * * *` format, and select your time zone to run your job periodically. Refer to the [cron schedules documentation](/serverless/jobs/reference-content/cron-schedules/) for more information.
    - Define any **environment variables** you want to inject into your job in the advanced options. For each environment variable, click **+Add new variable** and enter the key/value pair.
    - Add a **startup command** to your job. It will be executed every time your job is run.
    - Set a **maximum duration** to your job to stop it automatically if it does not complete within this limit.
    - Verify the **estimated cost**.
4. Click **Create a job definition** to finish. You are directed to the listing of your Serverless Jobs.

5. Click the name of the job you just created. The **Overview** tab displays.

6. Click **Run job** to execute it.

The execution appears in the **Job runs** section of the **Overview** tab.
