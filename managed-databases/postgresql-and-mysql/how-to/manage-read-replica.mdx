## How to resync a read replica

When you resync a read replica, first it is reset, and then its data is resynchronized from the primary node. Your read replica will be unavailable during the resync process. The duration of this process is proportional to your Database Instance size. The configured endpoints will not change.

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Scroll down to the **Read Replica** section. 
4. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Resync** next to the name of the read replica you want to resync. A pop-up displays.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-read-replica-resync.webp" alt="A pop-up displays the following message: Resync data from primary node. Are you sure you want to reset and resync the data of 2c241214-030e-4900-a993-579ba6fa2da7 from the main node? Your read replica will be unavailable during the resync process. The duration of this process is proportional to your Database Instance size." />

5. Make sure you have selected the correct read replica and click **Resync**. The list of your read replicas displays.

## How to manage Private Networks

You can attach your read replica to a Private Network even after its creation.

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Scroll down to the **Read Replica** section. 
4. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Attach Private Network** next to the name of your selected read replica. A pop-up displays.
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-attach-pn-readreplica.webp" alt="A pop-up with the steps to attach a Private Network displays." />
5. Select an existing Private Network to attach to your read replica.
6. Configure your IP address and its corresponding mask. 

If you already have an attached Private Network, you can detach it from your read replica.

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Scroll down to the **Read Replica** section. 
4. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Detach Private Network** next to the name of your selected read replica. A pop-up displays to ask if you are sure you want to detach the Private Network.
5. Click **Detach Private Network** to proceed. The list of your read replicas displays. The private endpoint is removed. 

## How to delete read replicas

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Scroll down to the **Read Replica** section. 
4. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Delete**. A pop-up appears warning you that **this will permanently delete your read replica and all associated endpoints. This action is irreversible.**
5. Click **Delete read replica** to do so. The list of your read replicas displays.
