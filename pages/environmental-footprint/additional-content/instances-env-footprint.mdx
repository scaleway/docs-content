For Instances, the calculation of the environmental footprint takes into consideration all the elements described on the [Environmental Footprint calculation breakdown](/environmental-footprint/additional-content/environmental-footprint-calculator/) documentation page.

The calculations performed across all phases of the product lifecycle are considered, including the calculations for Bare Metal, as Instances are hosted on physical servers.

The following elements are additionally considered:
  - **Hypervisor resources** - the resources (CPU, RAM, and disk, for example) used in the physical hypervisor servers that create and run the virtual Instances.
  - **Instance offer resources** - the vCPU, RAM, and disk resources used when you use an Instance.

The calculation for the elements above can be broken down into:

## Calculation aspects

### Manufacturing Impact
      - Manufacturing of the underlying physical servers (hypervisors) necessary to run the Instances.
      - Distribution of the manufacturing impact according to the resources consumed by the Instance (vCPU, RAM, storage).

### Operational Impact
      - Energy consumption of the hypervisors during Instance usage.
      - [Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)](/environmental-footprint/concepts#pue-power-usage-effectiveness) specific to the data center where the Instance is hosted.
      - Energy mix of the country that provides the electricity.

### Usage Impact
      - Resources consumed by the Instance, calculated based on the material specifications of the hypervisors.


### Indirect Emissions
      - Impact related to cross-functional services necessary to guarantee the operation of the Instance, such as network and shared storage.



## Instance consumption ratio

When calculating an Instance's footprint, we consider the resources based on their relative usage on the hypervisor to ensure an accurate distribution of their proportional consumption.

- **CPU** - Consider the share of vCPUs reserved compared to the total number of physical cores available.
- **RAM** - Consider the share of allocated RAM compared to the total RAM of the hypervisor.
- **Storage** - Consider the use of allocated storage compared to the total capacity of the hypervisor.

The value derived from this calculation will be used in every step of the calculation of the Instance's footprint. The variable is represented as `Resources_Used_VM` in the image above. From now on we will refer to the Instance consumption ratio as `Resources_Used_VM`.

Refer to the table below to understand how the `Resources_Used_VM` is integrated into the calculation of each aspect of the total fooprint calculation.

| Calculation aspect | Formula |
| --- | --- |
| Datacenter Manufacturing Impact | (Du_vm / DDV_dc) x (Puiss_vm / Puiss_DC) x EF_dc x Resources_Used_VM |
| Network Equipment Manufacturing Impact | (Du_vm / DDV_reseau) x (Puiss_vm / Puiss_reseau) x EF_reseau x Resources_Used_VM|
| Internal Infrastructure Manufacturing and Usage Impact | (Du_vm / DDV_infra) x (Puiss_vm / Puiss_infra) x EF_infra x Resources_Used_VM |
| Instance Infrastructure Manufacturing and Usage Impact | DIFFERENTTTTTTTTTTTTROEIHOIHOTRIH|
| Equipment in Stock Manufacturing and Usage Impact | (Du_vm / DDV_stock) x (Puiss_vm / Puiss_stock) x EF_stock x Resources_Used_VM |


## Calculation example

In this example we will calculate the impact of an Instance with the following characteristics:

| Resource | VM | Hypervisor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| vCPU | 4 | 16 CPU cores |
| RAM | 8 GB | 64 GB |
| Storage | 50 GB | 1 TB (1000 GB) |

The allocation of the hypervisor resources for this particular Instance is calculated in the following manner:

| Resource | Allocation |
| --- | --- |
| CPU | 4/16 = 0.25 |
| RAM | 8/64 = 0.125 |
| Storage | 50/1000 = 0.05 |
| Total Instance Share | 0.25 + 0.125 + 0.05 = 0.425 |

To calculate the Instance's energy consumption we:

1. Consider the hypervisor's consumption (1000 kWh) and multiply it by the total Instance share (0.425):
    ```
    1000 kWh × 0.425 = 425 kWh
    ```
2. Adjust the energy consumption based on the [PUE](/environmental-footprint/concepts#pue-power-usage-effectiveness) of the data center (1.3) where the hypervisor is located:
    ```
    425 kWh × 1.3 = 552.5 kWh
    ```
3. Calculate the total emissions of the Instance based on the energy mix (300 gCO2eq/kWh) of the country where the hypervisor is located:
    ```
    300 gCO2eq/kWh = 165.75 kgCO2eq
    ```

    **Total estimated Instance emission** = 165.75 kgCO2eq
