VPC allows you to build your own **V**irtual **P**rivate **C**loud on top of Scaleway's shared public cloud. One default VPC per region is automatically created per Scaleway [Project](/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project), and you can create more if you wish. Within each VPC, you can create **Private Networks** and attach Scaleway resources (Instances, Elastic Metal servers, Load Balancers etc.) to them, as long as the resources are within the network's region. 

<Lightbox src="scaleway-vpc-routing-nacl-diag.webp" alt="A diagram shows that several Private Networks exist within a single VPC. The VPC's routing and NACL features control traffic between its Private Networks." size="small"/>

Attached resources can then communicate between themselves in an isolated and secure virtual layer 2 network, away from the public internet. VPC **routing** facilitates communication between resources on the different Private Networks within the VPC. The VPC's **N**etwork **A**ccess **C**ontrol List allows you to restrict traffic flow along certain routes.

## How to identify your default VPCs

One default VPC per region is automatically created per Scaleway [Project](/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project). You can [create more](/vpc/how-to/create-vpc/) if you wish, but it is not necessary for basic use cases.

Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the Scaleway console side menu. Your [VPC dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/vpc/vpc) displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-default-vpc.webp" alt="" />

You see three default VPCs, one for each of the following regions:

- Paris `PAR`
- Amsterdam `AMS`
- Warsaw `WAW`

Any new Private Networks that you create will be added to the default VPC for their region, unless you override this by specifying a different VPC.

## How to create a Private Network

1. Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the side menu. The list of your VPCs displays:

    Each Private Network must be created within a VPC.

2. Click the VPC you wish to create your Private Network in.

    If you already have existing Private Networks in this VPC, a list of these displays. Otherwise, you see a welcome screen.

3. Click **+ Create Private Network**. The creation screen displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-pn.webp" alt=""/>

4. Enter a **name** for the network, or leave the randomly-generated name in place. Optionally, you can also add **tags** to help organize your Private Networks. Each tag should be separated by a space.

    <Macro id="pn-naming"/>

    Leave the Advanced Settings at default values, to create a network with an auto-generated CIDR block. IP addresses for attached resources will come from this block.

5. Click **Create Private Network** to finish. Your Private Network is created.

1. Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the side menu. Your VPC [dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/vpc/vpc) displays:

2. Click the VPC containing the Private Network to which you want to attach a resource.

    A list of Private Networks in this VPC displays:

3. Click the Private Network to which you want to attach a resource.

    The Private Network's dashboard displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-pn-overview.webp" alt="" />

4. Click the **Attached resources** tab.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-pn-attached-resources.webp" alt="" />

5. Use the toggle to select the type of resource you want to attach:

    - **Managed** resources are created and managed via Scaleway, e.g. Instances, Elastic Metal servers, Load Balancers, Managed Databases, Kubernetes Kapsules, Public Gateways, Apple silicon etc.
    - **Custom** resources are created and managed by yourself, e.g. virtual machines you are hosting on a Proxmox cluster on an Elastic Metal server. 

6. Click **+ Attach resource**. A pop-up displays.

7. Complete the required information about the resource to attach. This depends on whether you are attaching a managed or custom resource.
    
    <Tabs id="attach-resource">
    
        <TabsTab label="Managed resource">

        <Lightbox src="scaleway-attach-resource.webp" alt="" />

        - From the first drop-down, select the **type** of managed resource (Instance, Elastic Metal server etc.) to attach.
        - From the second drop-down, select the **specific resource** of this type to attach. Only resources within the same region as the Private Network will be displayed.
        - Select whether to **auto-allocate an available IP** from the pool of addresses for the Private Network or **specify an IP** that you have already [reserved via IPAM](/ipam/how-to/reserve-ip/). 

        <Message type="note">
        Only Instances, Load Balancers, Public Gateways, and Elastic Metal servers are compatible with reserved IPs. Support for Managed Databases and Apple silicon will be coming soon. In the meantime, you must auto-allocate IPs for these products.
        </Message>
        </TabsTab>

        <TabsTab label="Custom resource">

        <Lightbox src="scaleway-attach-custom.webp" alt="" />
        
        <Message type="important">
        This method is intended for custom resources such as VMs hosted on Elastic Metal. Do **not** attempt to attach a managed resource, such as an Instance, via this method - use the **Managed resource** attachment instead.
        </Message>

        - Select **Custom resource** from the **Type of resource** dropdown.
        - Enter the MAC address of the custom resource you want to attach, e.g. `00:1B:44:11:3A:B7`.
        - Enter the name of the resource. This will be used for DNS resolution on the Private Network.
        </TabsTab>
    </Tabs>

8. Click **Attach to Private Network** to finish.

    You are returned to the list of attached resources, where the newly-attached resource now displays.

    <Message type="tip">
    **Viewing the resource's private IP**: When you attach a resource to a Private Network, it gets a private IPv4 address on that network (and also an IPv6 address, if supported by the resource). Private IPs are assigned from the CIDR block defined at the time of the Private Network's creation, either via auto-assignment or specification of a particular [reserved IP](/ipam/how-to/reserve-ip/). You can view a resource's IPv4 or v6 address in the **Attached Resources** tab of the Private Network itself (follow steps 1 - 5 above). It can also be viewed via the **Private Networks** tab of the resource's own dashboard.

## How to manage routing

Routing is used to manage and control the flow of traffic within a VPC. It tells the VPC where to send traffic trying to get to a specific destination IP address. Notably, it allows traffic to be automatically routed between resources attached to different Private Networks within the VPC, using their private IP addresses. You can also create your own custom routes.

Your VPC’s route table can be found in its **Routing** tab. The route table shows all the existing routes for the VPC.

1. Click VPC in the **Network** section of the side menu. The list of your VPCs displays.

2. Click a VPC, and click the **Routing** tab.

    Routes are automatically generated and added to the route table when you:

    - [Create a Private Network](#how-to-create-a-private-network) in the VPC (this generates a local subnet route, which allows the VPC to automatically route traffic between Private Networks), or
    - [Attach a Public Gateway](/public-gateways/how-to/configure-a-public-gateway/#how-to-attach-a-public-gateway-to-a-private-network) to a Private Network and set it to advertise a default route. This generates a default route to the internet.
    - [Create a custom route](/vpc/how-to/manage-routing/#how-to-create-a-custom-route).

When your route table starts to populate, it will look something like this:

<Lightbox src="scaleway-route-table.webp" alt="" />

For help with understanding the route table and how to read it, refer to our documentation about route tables.

## How to manage your NACL

Each VPC has its own Network **A**ccess **C**ontrol **L**ist. This is composed of stateless rules to control the flow of traffic between Private Networks. By default, the list contains no rules and therefore traffic is allowed to flow unrestrictedly between the VPC's Private Networks. [Add rules](/vpc/how-to/manage-nacl/) to the list to start creating restrictions.

## How to delete a Private Network

You must [detach](/vpc/how-to/attach-resources-to-pn/#how-to-detach-a-resource-from-a-private-network) all resources from the Private Network before you can delete it. 

1. Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the side menu.

    Each Private Network exists within a VPC.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-default-vpc.webp" alt="" />

2. Click the VPC containing the Private Network you want to delete.

    A list of your Private Networks in this VPC displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-pns.webp" alt="" />

3. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the Private Network you want to delete, then click **Delete** on the pop-up menu.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-delete-pn.webp" alt="" />

    A screen displays asking you to confirm that you want to delete the network.

4. Type **DELETE** and click **Delete Private Network**.

  Your Private Network is deleted.
