Plans are the service tiers for Transactional Email, each offering specific features, pricing, and usage limits to suit different needs—from occasional low-volume senders to high-volume enterprise users. Plans are scoped to Projects.

Two plans are available:
  - **Essential** - pay-as-you-go plan designed for occasional or low-volume email sending needs. This plan offers simplified management and a single webhook per domain.
  - **Scale** - fixed-price plan tailored for high-volume email sending. Includes 100K emails. Additional emails are charged. This plan includes a dedicated IP address and unlimited webhooks per domain. It also features advanced blocklist management, allowing for manual additions.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to change TEM plans

When you configure a domain with Transactional Email in a Project for the first time, you are prompted to select a TEM plan between [Essential](/transactional-email/concepts#essential-plan) and [Scale](/transactional-email/concepts#scale-plan).

You can change your selected plan anytime in the Scaleway console.

1. Click **Transactional Email** in the **Domains & Web Hosting** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. Your domains display.
2. Click the **Plans** tab.
3. Scroll to the **Manage your plan** section.
4. Click **Select plan** to select the plan to which you want to change. A pop-up appears.
    <Message type="important">
      - If you are upgrading to the **Scale plan** keep in mind that:
          - You will be billed a fixed monthly amount, instead of pay-as-you-go.
          - A 30-day commitment is required to ensure a progressive and effective [warm-up of the IP address](/transactional-email/concepts#ip-warm-up). If you decide to downgrade or cancel your account before the end of the commitment period, you will still be charged for the 30-day period.
      - If you are downgrading to the **Essential plan**, consider that:
          - You will lose access to your dedicated IP address and will be reverted to a shared IP. This may impact your sending speed and deliverability.
          - This will reduce the number of available webhooks
          - You will be reverted to an automatic blocklist. This means you will no longer be able to manually add emails to your blocklist.

5. Type **UPGRADE** to confirm.

## How to keep track of your resources

Each TEM plan has a number of domains and webhooks included in the plan. To keep track of your usage and consumption, you can follow the steps below:

1. Click **Transactional Email** in the **Domains & Web Hosting** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. Your domains display.
2. Click the **Plans** tab.
3. Scroll to the **Current plan** section. This section shows you how many domains and webhooks are currently being used in your Project.

    If you reach or surpass the free capacity of your plan, the number of resources will be indicated in red.

A maximum of 5 domains are available with the Essential plan. 2 Webhooks used in this Project. 1 webhook is available per domain with the Essential plan. Free emails per month: 0/300. A button to upgrade plan is also shown." />

    You can click the information tooltip next to the number to view details on how much each resource exceeded the included amount.
