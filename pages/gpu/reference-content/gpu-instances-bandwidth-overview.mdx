Scaleway GPU Instances are designed to deliver **high-performance computing** for AI/ML workloads, rendering, scientific simulations, and visualization tasks.
This guide provides a detailed overview of their **internet and Block Storage bandwidth capabilities** to help you choose the right instance for your GPU-powered workloads.

### Why bandwidth matters for GPU Instances  

GPU workloads often involve processing large datasets, requiring high-bandwidth networking and storage access.
- **Internet bandwidth**: Determines how fast your Instance can send or receive data from external sources, enabling smooth data transfers for model training or streaming.
- **Block bandwidth**: Impacts data access speeds for datasets stored in Block Storage, optimizing performance for AI pipelines, rendering workflows, and other data-intensive applications.

<Message type="important">
  Bandwidth specifications listed here are for informational purposes only. To validate the exact bandwidth capacity of your GPU Instance, refer to the `block_bandwidth` field in the [Instances API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/#path-instance-types-list-instance-types). Use the endpoint `/instance/v1/zones/{zone}/products/servers` to retrieve GPU Instance specifications.

<Message type="tip">
  To maximize compatibility with [Block Storage Low Latency 15k](/block-storage/), select an Instance with **at least 3 GiB/s** of Block bandwidth.
