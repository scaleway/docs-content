<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have a [PostgreSQL or MySQL Database Instance](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/quickstart)
  - You have a Database Instance with local storage
</Message>

It is possible to change your [volume type](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/concepts/#volume-type) anytime in the Scaleway console.

1. Click **Change volume type** under **Volume settings** in your Database Instance information page.
    <Message type="important">
      Before changing the volume type, make sure your Instance is in one of the following states:
      - `READY` (represented as "Running" in the Scaleway console)
      - `DISK_FULL`
    </Message>
    A pop-up appears.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-change-volume-type-popup.webp" alt="" />
2. Select **Block Storage**.
3. Click **Update volume type** to confirm.

    The Database Instance goes into the `Initializing` state.

    <Message type="important">
      If you are changing from a Block to a local volume, make sure to select a node with  a local storage size greater than or equal to your current Block Storage.
    </Message>
