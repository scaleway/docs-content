## Perceval: The native SDK for photonic
**Perceval** is the open-source software framework created by Quandela for linear optical quantum computing. It provides a simple and powerful object-oriented API to:

- **Design** - linear optical circuits (Beam Splitters, Phase Shifters, etc.).
- **Simulate** - photon behavior (ideal or noisy simulation).
- **Execute** - algorithms on various backends: local simulators, high-performance remote simulators (on GPU), or real photonic QPUs.

On Scaleway QaaS, the integration is natively integrated into `perceval-quandela` package, which acts as a remote backend for your sequences.
