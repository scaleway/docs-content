This page shows you how to manage a container, should you need to verify or edit its deployment parameters after creation. You can deploy a container from the [Scaleway Container Registry](/containers/container-registry/quickstart/) or any other public container registry, such as Docker Hub, AWS Container registries, GitLab container registry, etc.

## How to manage a container deployment

### Manage a deployment from the Scaleway Container Registry

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The Containers page displays.
2. Click the relevant containers namespace.
3. Click the name of the container you want to manage.
4. Check or edit any of the following information as required, on the **Deployment** tab:
    - Select the **Scaleway** Container Registry.
    - Choose an **image** from your Container Registry. Select the required Container Registry namespace from the drop-down list, and then select the container and tag.
    - Choose the **Port** your container is listening on. We recommend configuring your container to listen on the **PORT** environment variable.
    - Choose the **resources** to be allocated to your container at runtime. These define the performance characteristics of your container.
    - Set your **scaling** preferences, or leave them at default values. The Scaleway platform autoscales the number of available instances of your container to match the incoming load, depending on the settings you define here.
    - Define any **environment variables** you want to inject into your container. For each environment variable, click **+Add new variable** and enter the key/value pair.
    - Add **secrets** for your container. Secrets are environment variables which are injected into your container, but the values are not retained or displayed by Scaleway after initial validation.
    - Set the desired **privacy policy** for your container. This defines whether container invocation may be done anonymously (**public**) or only via an authentication mechanism provided by the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-containers/#authentication) (**private**).
    - Click **Advanced Options** if you wish to set a custom timeout for your container.
5. Click **Deploy container** to save any changes you have made.

    - Choose the **Port** your container is listening on. We recommend configuring your container to listen on the **PORT** environment variable.
