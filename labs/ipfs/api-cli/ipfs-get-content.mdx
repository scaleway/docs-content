## Get from Kubo client

Once your content is pinned on our service, you can fetch it via any other [Kubo client](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/command-line/). It is Linux/Max/Windows compatible.

First, make sure your client is running:

```
ipfs init && ipfs daemon
```

Then, run the following command.

```
ipfs get <YOUR_PINNED_CID> > myFile
```

Your content will be stored in `myFile`.

## Get from HTTP gateway

You can either use a web browser or `curl` to fetch public content via an IPFS gateway if you prefer not to use a local client.

```
curl https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<YOUR_PINNED_CID>
```

## Get from Go client

If you plan to fetch your pinned content via a Go program, we recommend to use the official [go-ipfs-api package](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-api).

In this case, you need to run an IPFS node (like Kubo) to perform operations with the IPFS network.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "os"


  ipfs "github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-api"
)


func main() {
	// Where your local node is running on localhost:5001
	sh := ipfs.NewShell("localhost:5001")
	err := sh.Get("<YOUR_PINNED_CID>", "myFile")
	if err != nil {
          fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "error: %s", err)
          os.Exit(1)
	}
}
```
