Once enabled, the versioning feature supports the retrieval of objects that are deleted or overwritten. It is a way to keep multiple variants of an object in the same bucket.

If the feature is enabled, you can list archived versions of an object or permanently delete an archived version.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created an Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)
</Message>

<Message type="note">
  If you enable versioning, you will have several object versions. Each version of an object stored in your bucket takes up disk space and is billed.

2. Click the name of your selected bucket.
3. Click the **Bucket settings** tab.
4. Scroll down and click **Enable versioning** under **Bucket versioning**.
  A pop-up appears to confirm versioning activation.

## How to suspend versioning

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. A list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the name of your selected bucket.
3. Click the **Bucket settings** tab.
4. Scroll down and click **Disable versioning** under **Bucket versioning**.
   A pop-up appears with the following message:
    <Message type="important">
      Once Versioning is suspended, no new versions of objects will be created. Versions created up until this point will remain stored and listed. If you upload an object with the same name as an existing object, the old object will be overwritten.
    </Message>
5. Click **Disable bucket versioning** if you agree and wish to proceed with versioning suspension on the bucket.
