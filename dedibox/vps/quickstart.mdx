A Dedibox VPS (Virtual Private Server) operates within a larger physical infrastructure, providing directly accessible computing resources and greater control than shared hosting solutions.

Dedibox VPSs are versatile, serving various purposes such as hosting websites, web applications, databases, and development environments.
They offer a balance of performance, control, and affordability for businesses and individuals with moderate to high-traffic websites or applications.
