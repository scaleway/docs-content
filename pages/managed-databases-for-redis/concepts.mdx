## Allowed IPs

Access control list (ACL) rules [define permissions for remote access to a Database Instance](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/manage-allowed-ip-addresses/). A rule consists of an IP address or an IP range.

## Cluster

A Redis™<sup>*</sup> cluster consists of a set of primary and secondary nodes. The cluster nodes use hash partitioning to split the keyspace into 16,384 key slots. Each primary of the cluster is responsible for a subset of those slots. Each secondary node replicates the data of one of the primary ones.

## Cluster mode

Each Managed Database for Redis™ cluster consists of minimum three and maximum six compute Instances hosting each a primary Redis™ Instance and a secondary Instance for one of the other nodes. If one of the primary nodes fails, the remaining nodes hold a vote and elect one of the remaining secondary nodes as the new primary node. When the failing node rejoins the cluster, it automatically becomes a secondary node and begins to replicate the data of another primary node.

Learn more about the cluster mode on the [Managed Databases for Redis™ FAQ page](/managed-databases-for-redis/faq/#what-is-the-logic-behind-the-cluster-mode).

## Endpoint

An endpoint is a point of connection to a database. The endpoint is associated with one or more public IPv4 addresses and a port, or with a private IPv4 and a port (if you use [Private Networks](/vpc/concepts/#private-networks)).

## Database Instance

A Database Instance is made up of multiple (at least 1) dedicated compute nodes, and is running a single Database Engine. Exactly one database engine is running on each node.

## High availability

High Availability is a Database Instance configuration that allows you to create a standby node, with an up-to-date replica of the database. If the main node fails for any reason, the standby can take over requests, reducing downtime.

The HA standby node is linked to the main node, using asynchronous replication. Asynchronous replication allows you to maintain good performance.

## Horizontal scaling

A feature that allows you to increase the size of your Redis™ Database Instance infrastructure by adding more nodes to your Database Instance to increase your number of endpoints and distribute cache.

## In-memory database

A database management system primarily built upon memory. Data is managed and stored within the main memory of an Instance. This allows the optimization of request speed and the improvement of application performance.

## Managed Database

Compared to traditional database management, which requires customers to provision their own infrastructure and resources to manage their databases, Managed Databases offer the user access to a Database Instance without them needing to set up the hardware or configure the software.

## Max memory

A configuration directive used to set the maximum amount of memory Redis™ can use for a data set. You can set this value via the Scaleway console or by configuring the `available_settings` via API.

## Region and Availability Zone

## TCP Keep alive

A packet that is sent by a device when the [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) connection on a routing device has been idle for too long. The packet is sent to the peer with only the Acknowledgement flag (ACK) turned on.

## TLS

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is an internet security protocol that enables data to be securely exchanged over a network using in transit encryption.

## Vertical scaling

Feature that allows you to increase the size of your Redis™ Database Instance by upgrading to a bigger node type to allow increased traffic for the same endpoint.
