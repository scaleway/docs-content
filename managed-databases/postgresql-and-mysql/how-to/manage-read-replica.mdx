## How to resync a Read Replica

When you resync a Read Replica, first it is reset, and then its data is resynchronized from the primary node. Your Read Replica will be unavailable during the resync process. The duration of this process is proportional to your Database Instance size. The configured endpoints will not change.

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Scroll down to the **Read Replica** section.
4. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Resync** next to the name of the Read Replica you want to resync. A pop-up displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-read-replica-resync.webp" alt="A pop-up displays the following message: Resync data from primary node. Are you sure you want to reset and resync the data of 2c241214-030e-4900-a993-579ba6fa2da7 from the main node? Your Read Replica will be unavailable during the resync process. The duration of this process is proportional to your Database Instance size." />
5. Make sure you have selected the correct Read Replica and click **Resync**. The list of your Read Replicas displays.

## How to promote a Read Replica

It is possible to promote a Read Replica node to a standalone Database Instance.

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Scroll down to the **Read Replica** section.
4. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Promote Read Replica** next to the name of the Read Replica you want to promote. A pop-up displays.
    <Message type="important">
      Promoting a Read Replica is irreversible. Make sure that the main Database Instance node has completed all ongoing operations, and that the Read Replica lag is down to zero before promoting it. This helps ensure that the promoted Read Replica contains all operations from the main node.
    </Message>

    <Message type="note">
      If the Read Replica you promote is attached to a Private Network, the resulting node will also be attached to the same Private Network. It will maintain the same private endpoint.
    </Message>
5. Click **Promote Read Replica**.
6. Go back to the list of your Database Instances. The promoted Read Replica appears.
    <Message type="important">
      The new Instance originating from the Read Replica promotion will bear the prefix `promoted`, followed by the name of the original Database Instance that was replicated. You can change the name of your Database Instance on its overview page anytime. To do so, click <Icon name="edit" /> next to its name.

## How to manage Private Networks

You can attach and detach your Read Replica to a Private Network even after its creation.

### Attach your Read Replica to a new Private Network

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Scroll down to the **Read Replica** section.
4. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Attach Private Network** next to the name of your selected Read Replica. A pop-up displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-attach-pn-readreplica.webp" alt="A pop-up with the steps to attach a Private Network displays." />
5. Select **Create and attach a new Private Network**.
    <Message type="important">
      Your private IP addresses are automatically allocated. They are managed via an IP Address Manager (IPAM). You can retrieve them on the Private Network tab of your Database Instance. To allocate IPs manually, you can use the Scaleway API and CLI, or Terraform.
    </Message>
6. Click **Attack Private Network**.

### Attach your Read Replica to an existing Private Network

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the Database Instance name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Scroll down to the **Read Replica** section.
4. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Attach Private Network** next to the name of your selected Read Replica. A pop-up displays.
5. Select an existing Private Network to attach to your Read Replica.
    <Message type="important">

### Detach your Read Replica from a Private Network

If you already have an attached Private Network, you can detach it from your Read Replica.

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Scroll down to the **Read Replica** section.
4. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Detach Private Network** next to the name of your selected Read Replica. A pop-up displays to ask if you are sure you want to detach the Private Network.
5. Click **Detach Private Network** to proceed. The list of your Read Replicas displays. The private endpoint is removed.

## How to delete Read Replicas

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Scroll down to the **Read Replica** section.
4. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Delete**. A pop-up appears warning you that **this will permanently delete your Read Replica and all associated endpoints. This action is irreversible.**
5. Click **Delete Read Replica** to do so. The list of your Read Replicas displays.
