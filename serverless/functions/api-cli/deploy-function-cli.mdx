## Scaleway Command Line Interface Overview

[The Scaleway Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli) allows you to pilot your Scaleway infrastructure directly from your terminal, providing a faster way to administer and monitor your resources. Scaleway CLI is easy to set up and use, and an essential tool for operating efficiently in your cloud environment. The CLI provides many functionalities, including the ability to create and deploy Serverless Functions.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your SSH key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
  - You have [generated your API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
  - You have [downloaded and installed the Scaleway CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli)
</Message>

## Configuring the CLI

1. Open a terminal and type the following command to configure the Scaleway CLI on your machine:

    ```
    scw init
    ```

    If you have already configured the CLI, you will see a message like the following:

    ```
    Current config is located at /path/to/config.yaml
    access_key: your-access-key
    secret_key: your-secret-key
    default_organization_id: ID-of-your-organization
    default_project_id: ID-of-your-project
    default_region: your-default-region (fr-par)
    default_zone: your-default-zone (fr-par-1)

    Do you want to override the current config? (Y/n):
    ```

2. Type `n` and go directly to the [Creating a functions namespace](#creating-a-functions-namespace) step of this procedure if you do not want to edit your configuration.

    If you have not yet configured the CLI, you will be guided through the configuration process via a series of questions:

    ```
    Enter a valid secret-key or an email
    ```

3. Enter either the email address for your account (you will then be asked for your password), or your [API secret key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key):

    ```
    To improve this tool we rely on diagnostic and usage data.
    Sending such data is optional and can be disabled at any time by running "scw config set send-telemetry=false".
    Do you want to send usage statistics and diagnostics? (Y/n):
    ```

    Type `y` or `n`.

    ```
    To fully enjoy Scaleway CLI we recommend you install autocomplete support in your shell.
    Do you want to install autocomplete? (Y/n):
    ```

    Type `y` or `n`.

    ```
    To enable autocomplete, scw needs to update your shell configuration.
    What type of shell are you using (default: zsh):
    ```

4. Press enter if the default shell type displayed is the one you are using. Otherwise, enter the correct shell type you are using. This should complete the configuration process:

    ```
    Initialization completed with success.
    ```

## Creating a function

1. Run the following command in your terminal to create a functions namespace:

  ```
  scw function namespace create name=<YOUR_NAMESPACE_NAME>
  ```

  An output similar to the following displays:
  
  ```
  ID                   6e74dbb7-9323-46bb-abc7-5c0105f4e70e
  Name                 <YOUR_NAMESPACE_NAME>
  OrganizationID       55e28409-776f-4f65-a41e-6c5fc58b4076
  ProjectID            55e28409-776f-4f65-a41e-6c5fc58b4076
  Status               pending
  RegistryNamespaceID  -
  RegistryEndpoint     -
  Description          -
  Region               fr-par
  ```

3. Run the following command in your terminal to create a function:

  ```
  scw function function create name=<FUNCTION_NAME> namespace-id=<NAMESPACE_ID> runtime=<YOUR_RUNTIME>
  ```

    An output similar to the following displays:

    ```
    ID              717fb5f9-95c3-4c0b-84db-2321283e46dc
    Name            <FUNCTION_NAME>
    NamespaceID     cee31af8-d43e-4078-8f55-c921a9311f47
    Status          created
    MinScale        0
    MaxScale        5
    Runtime         python310
    MemoryLimit     256
    CPULimit        140
    Timeout         5 minutes
    Handler         handler.handle
    Privacy         public
    Description     -

    ```

  </Message>

4. Create a zip file containing your function's code by following [this procedure](/serverless/functions/how-to/package-function-dependencies-in-zip/).

  <Message type="note">
    For testing purposes, you can create a zip archive with a simple Python file named `handler.py` inside, that contains the following code:

    ```python
    def handle(event, context):
    return {
        "body": {
            "message": 'Hello, world',
        },
        "statusCode": 200,
    }
    ```
  </Message>

## Deploying a function

1. Run the following command to deploy your function with the zip archive you just created:

```
scw function deploy name=<FUNCTION_NAME> namespace-id=<NAMESPACE_ID> runtime=<YOUR_RUNTIME> zip-file=path/to/archive/<ZIP_FILE>
```

  The deployment process can take up to three minutes.

2. Run the following command to call your function:

```bash
curl <YOUR_FUNCTION_ENDPOINT>
```

  Your function is now deployed and ready to be used.
