When you buy a domain name, you can use it for the period of time you registered it for, which is typically from one to ten years. When this period is nearing its end, you must renew your domain if you wish to keep using it.

1. In your browser, navigate to [the domain name renewal page](https://console.online.net/en/order/renew). A list of your hosting packages and domain names displays.

      You can also choose to activate automatic renewal of your webhosting and domain names. To do so, check the **Activate automatic renewal** box on the Summary page. Your services automatically renew 62 days before their expiry dates. As such, automatic renewal can only be activated 62 days prior the exipration date of the service.

    You are redirected to the payment gateway to complete your payment.
