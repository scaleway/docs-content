import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'


<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [Data Lab for Apache Spark™](/data-lab/how-to/create-data-lab/)

## Timeout errors

### Problem

Executing calculations within the notebook returns a timeout error after a few minutes.

### Cause

The Data Lab for Apache Spark™ cluster has zero worker nodes provisioned and cannot raise any resource to perform the required operations.

### Solution

[Edit your cluster configuration](/data-lab/how-to/manage-delete-data-lab/) by provisioning at least one worker node to be able to run calculations with it.

<Message type="note">
You can provision zero worker nodes again to retain you cluster and notebook configurations while minimizing its cost.
