**Pasqal** specializes in neutral atom quantum computing, controlling Rydberg atoms with high-precision optical tweezers. Their technology allows for arbitrary 2D and 3D topology and operates in Analog mode, which is particularly well suited for large-scale quantum simulation and optimization problems involving up to a hundred qubits.

## Key features

* **Scalability:** Pasqal's neutral atom technology allows for a high number of qubits in a single device, making it suitable for complex quantum algorithms.
* **Reconfigurable topology:** Atoms can be arranged in arbitrary 2D patterns, enabling flexible connectivity for various algorithms.
* **Analog mode:** Operates primarily as a quantum simulator (Hamiltonian evolution) rather than a gate-based computer, offering a different path to quantum advantage.

## Use cases
The Pasqal QPUs are particularly well suited for:
* **Quantum simulation:** Simulating complex quantum systems, especially in chemistry and material science.
* **Optimization problems:** Solving combinatorial optimization problems in QUBO representation using variational algorithms like QAOA

## Pasqal QPUs and emulators available at Scaleway
Scaleway provides access to Pasqal's "Orion Gamma" generation devices and their digital twins.

* **Fresnel (100 Qubits) QPU allows you to trap and control over 100 atoms. It exploits the **Rydberg blockade** mechanism to create entanglement between atoms.
* **Locations:** We provide access to two geographically distinct units:
    * `QPU-FRESNEL-100PQ` (Located in Massy, France)
    * `QPU-DISTRIQ-100PQ` (Located in Sherbrooke, Canada)
    * *Note: Both devices offer similar specifications.*

| Platform name | QPU Model | Qubits & Topology | Speed Metrics | Pricing Model |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **QPU-FRESNEL-100PQ** | Orion Beta | 100 atoms, 2D layout | shots: 0.25hz | 3.3€/shot (~0.83€/sec) |
| **QPU-DISTRIQ-100PQ** | Orion Beta | 100 atoms, 2D layout | shots: 0.25hz | 3.3€/shot (~0.83€/sec) |

We provide access to high-performance emulation environment, leveraging DGX-class GPU clusters to create digital twins of Pasqal QPUs. This is a crucial tool for reliably prototyping and validating complex Analog pulse sequences before running them efficiently on the physical hardware.

| Platform name | Hardware & emulator | Qubits & topology	| Speed metrics	| Pricing model |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **EMU-FRESNEL-100PQ** | A100 DGX cluster, Pulser | 100 atoms (tensor network), 2D layout | shots: 0.25hz | 11.2€/hour |

## Pulser: The native SDK
To program neutral atoms, you don't typically use "Gates" (like CNOT or Hadamard) as the primary abstraction. Instead, you define **Pulse Sequences** using **Pulser**, Pasqal's open-source Python SDK.

**Pulser allows you to:**
* **Define the register:** Place your atoms at specific coordinates.
* **Design the sequence:** Define the laser pulses (amplitude, detuning, phase) applied to the atoms over time.
* **Execute:** Run the sequence locally or remotely.

On Scaleway QaaS, the integration is handled by the `pulser-scaleway` package, providing access to Pasqal QPUs and emulators.
