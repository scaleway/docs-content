Explress is a lightweight NodeJS framework designed to ease building applications and APIs.
In this tutorial you will learn how to configure your [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) application to run on Scaleway Serverless Container.

## Creating an Express.js application

To begin, we need to create a web server with Node JS and an Express.js framework.

1.  Create a new folder for the project:
    ```
    mkdir my_nodejs_project
    ```
2. Install the `express` library: 
    ```
    npm install express
    ```

    Two files are created during this step: `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. 
3. Create a `server.js` file with the following code. This creates a simple Web Server using Express.js:
    ```js
    const express = require('express');

    // Constants
    const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080;
    const HOST = '0.0.0.0';

    // App
    const app = express();
    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
      res.send('Hello World');
    });

    app.listen(PORT, HOST);
    console.log(`Running on http://${HOST}:${PORT}`);
    ```

## Configuring the Docker image

In order to Dockerize our simple web App, we will use the official NodeJS image.

1. Create a Dockerfile using the following command: 
    ```
    touch Dockerfile
    ```
    <Message type="tip">
      A Dockerfile is a document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to create an image.
    </Message>
2. Open the Dockerfile in a text editor and specify the following actions:
    * Define the node version you want to use:

    ```dockerfile
    FROM node:14
    ```

    * Create a directory to store your application code:

    ```dockerfile
    # Create app directory
    WORKDIR /usr/src/app
    ```

    * Install the applications dependencies using the npm binary:

    ```dockerfile
    # Install app dependencies
    # A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
    COPY package*.json ./

    RUN npm install
    ```

    * Copy your code inside the Docker image:

    ```dockerfile
    # Bundle app source
    COPY . .

    Your App binds to the port define in the environment variable PORT, define it and expose the port 8080
    ENV PORT 8080
    EXPOSE 8080

    Use CMD to run the node server.js command that will start your application
    CMD [ "node", "server.js" ]
    ```

    The final Dockerfile should look like this example:

    ```dockerfile 
    FROM node:14

    # Create app directory
    WORKDIR /usr/src/app

    # Install app dependencies
    # A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
    COPY package*.json ./

    RUN npm install

    # Bundle app source
    COPY . .

    ENV PORT 8080
    EXPOSE 8080
    CMD [ "node", "server.js" ]
    ```

    To lighten your image, some folders and files need to be excluded from the image generation:
3. Create a `.dockerignore` file in the same directory as your Dockerfile:
    ```
    touch .dockerignore 
    ```
4. Open the `.dockerignore` file in a text editor and add the following content:
    ```
    node_modules
    npm-debug.log
    ```

## Deploying the application on Serverless Containers

1. Build your image using the following command: 
    ```sh
    docker build . -t <your application name>
    ```
2. [Push](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/containers/container-registry/how-to/push-images/) the created image into the [Container Registry](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/containers/container-registry/quickstart/) linked to your Containers namespace
    <Message type="tip">
      The registry name starts with `funcscw` + the namespace name.
    </Message>
3. Deploy the image using the Scaleway console.

## Conclusion

You have built, pushed and deployed your first web application using NodeJS and Express Server on Scaleway Serverless Containers. For more information about the Containers product, refer to our [dedicated product documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/serverless/containers/quickstart/).
