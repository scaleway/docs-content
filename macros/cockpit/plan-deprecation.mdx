 **Pricing update for Cockpit data custom retention** <br /><br />

 On January 1st, 2025, Cockpit pricing plans were deprecated and replaced by the custom [retention](/cockpit/concepts/#retention) feature, available for free during beta.
 On May 1st, 2025, this feature reaches general availability and becomes billable.

 **Logs and traces**: free retention for 7 days, then charged €0.002/GB/day
 **Metrics**: free retention for 31 days, then charged €0.0002/10 million samples/day

 Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/cockpit/how-to/change-data-retention/) to adjust retention settings and learn more about new pricing.
