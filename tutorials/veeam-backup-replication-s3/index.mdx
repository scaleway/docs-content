## Veeam Overview

[Veeam Backup & Replication](https://www.veeam.com/vm-backup-recovery-replication-software.html) is a proprietary backup application, developed by Veeam for virtual environments built on VMware vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisors.

The solution provides backup, restore and replication functionality for virtual machines, physical servers and workstations as well as cloud-based workloads.

A native S3 interface for Veeam Backup & Replication is part of the Release 9.5 update 4, available in General Availability since January 22nd 2019. It allows to push backups to a S3 compatible service to maximize backup capacity.

The following schema represents the functionality of Veeam Backup and Restore which acts as an intermediate agent to manage primary data storage and secondary and archival storage:

<Message type="requirement">

- You have a machine running [VMware vSphere](https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere.html)
- You have an intermediate instance running [Veeam Backup & Replication](https://www.veeam.com/vm-backup-recovery-replication-software.html)
- You have configured an Object Storage Bucket

</Message>

## Configuring Veeam backup & replication

<Message type="important">

A Veeam **Enterprise** or **Enterprise Plus** license is required in order to configure the Scale out Repository feature which is required for Object Storage. Contact your Veeam Account Manager in case you need a license upgrade. [More information on Veeam Backup & Replication licensing.](https://www.veeam.com/products-edition-comparison.html)

### Configuring an Object Storage repository

1. Once the Veeam Application is installed on your intermediate backup machine, start the Veeam Console by double clicking on the corresponding icon:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-01.png" alt="" />

2. Enter the appropriate credits (normally these values are pre-filled) and click **Connect**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-02.png" alt="" />

3. Once logged into the Veeam console, click **Backup Infrastructure**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-backup-infrastructure.png" alt="" />

4. Click **Backup Repositories** to enter the backup repository settings:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-03.png" alt="" />

5. Click **Add Repository** to add the Object Storage bucket as repository:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-04.png" alt="" />

6. Choose **Object Storage**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-05.png" alt="" />

7. Click **S3 Compatible**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-06.png" alt="" />

8. The setup wizard for the repository appears, provide a name and additional information for it, then click **Next**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-07.png" alt="" />

9. Click **Add** (1) to enter the [API key](/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key/) (2) related to the bucket. Optionally a description can be provided:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-08.png" alt="" />

10. Provide the **Service Point** and the **Region** of your bucket, before clicking on **Next**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-09.png" alt="" />

  <Message type="note">

  For a bucket located in the Amsterdam region, the service point is `s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud` and the region is `nl-ams`.

  </Message>

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-10.png" alt="" />

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-11.png" alt="" />

12. Verify all settings in the summary before clicking on **Finish**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-12.png" alt="" />

### Configuring a local backup repository

1. As Veeam cannot currently push backups directly to S3, a local backup repository is required which will be configured as **Storage Tier** with Object Storage in a later step. Click **Add Repository**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-04.png" alt="" />

2. Choose **Direct Attached Storage** from the provided options:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-13.png" alt="" />

3. Click **Microsoft Windows**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-14.png" alt="" />

4. Enter a **Name** and an optional **Description** for the repository before clicking on **Next**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-15.png" alt="" />

5. The local machine is pre-configured in this step. Click **Next**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-16.png" alt="" />

6. Click **Browse** to select a folder for local backups, then click **Next**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-17.png" alt="" />

7. Keep these settings with the default values and click **Next**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-18.png" alt="" />

8. A summary of the configuration is shown, click **Apply** to apply the configuration to the repository:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-19.png" alt="" />

9. Veeam applies the configuration and runs some checks. Once they have completed, exit the wizard by clicking on **Finish**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-20.png" alt="" />

### Configuring a scale-out repository

1. Enter the **Scale-out Repositories** section:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-21.png" alt="" />

2. Enter a **Name** and an optional **Description** for the Scale-out repository, then click **Next**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-22.png" alt="" />

3. Click **Add** and choose the local Backup repository from the list. Confirm and click **Next**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-23.png" alt="" />

4. Choose the **Placement Policy** for the repository. The default settings can be used, click **Next**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-24.png" alt="" />

5. Click **Extend Scale-out capacity with Object Storage** and choose your Object Storage repository from the drop-down list. It is also possible to define a time-frame in which backups are uploaded to Object Storage and after how many days backups are transferred automatically. If required data can also be encrypted by activating the option. Once the Object Storage settings are configured, click **Apply**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-25.png" alt="" />

6. Once the scale-out bucket is configured, exit the wizard by clicking on **Finish**.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-35.png" alt="" />

3. Click **Add** (1) and choose the virtual machines or hypervisors (2) to be backed up. Once finished, click **Next**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-36.png" alt="" />

4. Choose the previously configured Scale-out repository from the drop-down menu and choose the restore points to keep on disk for the backup. Click **Next** once this is done:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-37.png" alt="" />

5. Configure guest OS processing options for virtual machines. The default settings should be fine. Validate it by clicking on **Next**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-38.png" alt="" />

6. Configure a schedule to execute the backup job automatically. If no schedule is configured, the job must be started manually for each backup. Once the schedule is set, click **Next**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-39.png" alt="" />

7. A summary of the configured job is shown. Tick the box **Run the job when I click Finish** to execute the job immediately. If the box is not ticket, the first backup will be created according to the schedule. Click **Finish** to exit the wizard:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-veeam-40.png" alt="" />

Veeam proceeds with the backup and stores data on Object Storage. To verify it, log yourself into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com), enter the Object Storage section and choose the Bucket used for Veeam. Several files and folders created by the application are visible:
