The Easy Deploy feature allows you to pull images directly from [Scaleway Container Registry](/containers/container-registry/concepts/#container-registry), instantly deploying containerized applications in your [Kubernetes Kapsule](/containers/kubernetes/concepts/#kubernetes-kapsule) and [Kubernetes Kosmos](/containers/kubernetes/concepts/#kubernetes-kosmos) clusters.

You can also deploy off-the-shelf applications pre-configured for Scaleway products, such as Load Balancer and Block Storage.

**With only the basic options to set, you can use Kubernetes Kapsule or Kosmos without needing to manage your `.yaml` manifests.**

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
- Created a Scaleway Kubernetes [Kapsule](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/) or [Kosmos](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-kosmos-cluster/) cluster
- [Created a Scaleway Container Registry namespace](/containers/container-registry/how-to/create-namespace) (not mandatory if deploying using the Application Library)

## How to deploy an application

<Message type="note">
  To deploy a container from an image stored within Container Registry, you must be logged in to the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/).
</Message>

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Kubernetes Kapsule dashboard displays.
2. Click the name of the cluster you wish to deploy your image on. The **Cluster information** tab displays.
3. Click the **Easy Deploy** tab.
4. Click **Deploy application**.
5. Deploy the application. This step can be done in two ways:
  * **Deployment from Container Registry**

    * After selecting **Container Registry**, enter a name for your application as well as the Kubernetes namespace on which the deployment will run. By default, the application is deployed on the `default` namespace.

    * Select the Container Registry namespace you would like to deploy from the Container Registry. Specify **Container** and **Tag**.

      <Message type="note">
      Your container needs to be public in order to be selected and deployed.
      </Message>

      You can configure the deployment of your clusters in two ways: **Deployments** or **CronJobs**.

      A **Deployment** represents a set of identical pods with no individual identities managed by a deployment controller. The deployment controller runs multiple replicas of an application as specified in a ReplicaSet. If any pods fail or become unresponsive, the deployment controller replaces them until the actual state equals the desired state. **When using a deployment Kubernetes object, you do not need to manage your pods or ReplicaSet**.

      You can set up a Load Balancer for your container, create several replicas and add environment variables, such as database host/credentials.

      **CronJobs** in Kubernetes work like traditional cron jobs on Linux. They can be used to run tasks at a specific time or interval and may be useful for jobs such as backups or cleanup tasks. You can edit your deployments and CronJob settings, but cannot modify the type of deployment nor the container to deploy. If you need to do so, you will need to delete the existing deployment and create a new one accordingly.

      For CronJobs, an instruction schedule must be defined. Each cron instruction is scheduled using the following syntax:
      ```
      Minute (mm): 0 - 59
      Hour (hh): 0 - 23
      Day of the Month (dd): 1 - 31
      Month (MMM): 1 - 12
      Day of the Week (DDD): 0 - 6 (Sunday to Saturday, 7 is also Sunday on some systems)
      ```
      Each instruction can also be:
      ```
      *: at each unit (1, 2, 3, 4...)
      5,8: at unit 5 and 8
      2-5: at unit 2 to 5
      */3: every 3 unit (0, 3, 6, 9...)
      10-20/3: every 3 units, between the tenth and the twentieth (10, 13, 16, 19)

      Example: 45 23 * * 6
      This example executes program at 23:45 (11:45 PM) every Saturday.
      ```
      You must also include a path to your script in the **Command** box and set up environment variables.

    * Select a deployment type and fill out the prompted information according to your choice. A summary of your choices is available.

    *  Click **Deploy application** to proceed. The list of your deployed applications displays.


  * **Deployment from Application Library**

    * After selecting **Application Library**, enter a name for your container as well as the Kubernetes namespace on which the deployment will run. By default, the application is deployed on the `default` namespace.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubernetes-application-library.webp" alt="" />

    * Search and select the application you want to deploy from our library. For example, you can choose to deploy the WordPress application. A default `yaml` configuration will preload to show the specifics defaults values of the application. You can modify or add values to the `yaml` as you see fit.

      <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubernetes-yaml-edit.webp" alt="" />

      * Using `scw-bssd` Storage type will imply the creation of Scaleway Block Storage resources by your Kubernetes cluster, having an impact on your final invoice.
      * Using `LoadBalancer` service will imply the creation of a Scaleway Load Balancer, having an impact on your final invoice.

    * Click **Deploy application** to proceed. The list of your deployed applications displays.

    * If you created a LoadBalancer to expose your application, use the `kubectl` command to list the services of your cluster and get the LoadBalancer external IP.

      <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubernetes-kubectl-all.webp" alt="" />

    * Get the Load Balancer's external IP and use it in your web browser to access your application (WordPress in this case)
      <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubernetes-wordpress.webp" alt="" />

## How to edit an application

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Kubernetes Kapsule overview displays.
2. Click <Icon name="edit" /> next to the container you wish to edit, then click **Edit** in the menu. A pop-up displays with the configuration options.
3. When modifying an application deployed from **Container Registry**, modify the container parameters according to your requirements, then click **Update container** to conclude.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-update-container.webp" alt="" />
    <Message type="note">
      It is not possible to modify a container **type**. If you wish to use a different type, you must create a new container.
    </Message>
4. When modifying an application deployed from the **Application Library**, modify the application configuration according to your requirements, then click **Update and deploy** to conclude.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubernetes-edit-application.webp" alt="" />

## How to delete an application

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Kubernetes Kapsule dashboard displays.
2. Click <Icon name="edit" /> next to the container you want to delete, then click **Delete** in the pop-up menu. A message prompt displays to request confirmation.
3. To confirm the deletion of the deployment, click **Delete Deployment**.
    <Message type="important">
      Deleting a deployment is irreversible, and all data related to the deployment will be deleted.
