Scaleway Object Storage offers several [storage classes](/storage/objects/concepts/#storage-class) to choose from depending on the performance, access, resiliency, and cost requirements of your workloads.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the name of the bucket containing the object you want to edit. The list of objects displays.
3. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the object that you want to transfer.
    A pop-up displays.

    <Message type="important">
      If you transfer objects to `Glacier` class, you might have to restore your data at a later date. To facilitate the steps of restoration and ensure fast restitution of your data, we recommend you use average-sized files (larger than 1 MB).
