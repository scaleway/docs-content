API keys are unique identifiers necessary to use the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/). You can generate API keys for yourself or for an [IAM application](/iam/concepts/#application) via the Scaleway console. Each API key is scoped to one [Organization](/iam/concepts/#organization) only (so if you are part of multiple Organizations, you will need a different API key for each one). Each user and application can have multiple API keys in each Organization.

API keys always inherit the permissions of their bearer (the IAM user or IAM application with which they are associated), giving that bearer the exact rights and permissions that have been defined for them in the Organization via [policies](/iam/concepts/#policy).

<Message type="important">
  - You can only generate API keys for yourself and, if you are the Organization Owner or have [IAMManager permissions](/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/), for IAM applications. You cannot generate API keys for other IAM users, regardless of your permissions.
  - You can attach API keys to your own user to test and access your infrastructure, but we do not recommend this for all use cases.
</Message>

<Message type="tip">
  If you plan to create API keys that will be used for a long period of time, in production for example, we recommend that you use [applications](/iam/concepts/#application) as the bearers of these API keys. This way, the API keys are linked to non-human users, and are under no risk of leaving or being removed from the Organization.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)

1. Click **IAM & API keys** on the top-right drop-down menu of the Scaleway console. You are taken to your [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users).
    <Lightbox image={image} alt="" />

2. Click the **API keys** tab.
3. Click **+ Generate API key**. The following screen pops up:
    <Lightbox image={image2} alt="The image shows a pop-up in the Scaleway console where you can set up the API key bearer, the description, expiration date and whether the key will be used for Object Storage" />

4. Select the **bearer** of the API key. Choose between yourself (as an IAM user), or an [IAM application](/iam/concepts/#application) associated with the Organization.
5. Enter an optional **description** for the API key.
6. Enter the desired **expiration**. Choose from:
    - **Never**: the API key will never expire,
    - **1 hour / week / month / year**: the API key will expire at the end of the selected period,
    - **Custom**: you are prompted to enter a **date** on which the API key will expire.

7. Select whether the API key will be used for Object Storage. Choose from:
    - **Yes, set up preferred Project**: you are prompted to select a [Project](/iam/concepts/#project) that the API key will always use for Object Storage operations.
    - **No, skip for now**: the Project that you are currently navigating in the console (i.e. the one that is selected in your [Project dashboard](/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project-dashboard)) will be automatically selected as the preferred Project for Object Storage.

    <Message type="note">
      Preferred Projects for Object Storage - When creating and/or listing Object Storage buckets via the API, there is no available parameter to specify the Project in which you wish to list or create buckets. All buckets you create via the API will therefore be created in the preferred Project you choose when creating the API key. Similarly, when listing buckets, buckets from your preferred Project will be listed.
      Note that:
        - This applies to all actions on Object Storage buckets, but it does not apply to other products or resources.
        - You can still create and/or list buckets in your Project of choice via the Scaleway console.
      See our [dedicated documentation](/iam/api-cli/using-api-key-object-storage/) for more information.

8. Click **Generate API key**. A screen displays showing the access key and secret key for your new API key and reminding you that this is your only chance to securely save the secret key:

9. Ensure you have securely saved the secret key, then close the window. You are returned to the **API keys** tab, where your new API key now appears in the list.
