This page shows how to deactivate an SQS or SNS service, or delete a NATS account. These two processes are different, but equivalent.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [activated SQS or SNS, or created a NATS account](/serverless/messaging/how-to/get-started/)
</Message>

## How to deactivate SNS or SQS

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of Messaging and Queuing protocols displays.

2. Use the drop-down menu to select the [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) you want to deactivate the relevant protocol in.

3. Click **SQS** or **SNS** depending on which protocol you want to deactivate.

4. Click the **Settings** tab.

  <Message type="tip">
  If you do not currently have any credentials, topics or queues created for this protocol, you will not be able to access the Settings tab. Temporarily create credentials, or a topic or queue, in order to access the Settings tab. Then, proceed with the steps below to deactivate the protocol.
  </Message>

5. In the bottom panel, click the **Deactivate** button for the protocol.

    A pop-up displays, reminding you that any existing SQS (or SNS) resources you have will be permanently deleted, and that you will not be able to create any new queues/topics or credentials unless you reactivate the protocol.

6. Click **Deactivate SQS** (or SNS) to confirm.

<Message type="note">
SQS and SNS must be deactivated on a region-by-region basis. If you have activated SNS or SQS in other [regions](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region), and you also want to deactivate those, repeat the process above to deactivate the protocol in each one.
</Message>

## How to delete a NATS account

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of Messaging and Queuing protocols displays.

2. Use the drop-down menu to select the [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) containing the NATS account you want to delete.

3. Click **NATS**, then click the NATS account you want to delete.

4. In the bottom panel, click the **Delete NATS account** button.

    A pop-up displays, reminding you that the action is irreversible, and any associated queued messages and credentials will be deleted.

5. Type `DELETE` and click **Delete NATS account** to confirm.

<Message type="note">
Repeat the process above for each NATS account you want to delete. Remember to use the region drop-down as appropriate to access the different NATS accounts you hold in different regions.
