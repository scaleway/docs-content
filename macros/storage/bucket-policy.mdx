A **bucket policy** is a resource-based policy option. It allows users to grant access to buckets in other Scaleway projects and organizations. 

By default, all Object Storage resources in a project are private and can be accessed only by users of said project. Adding a bucket policy to a bucket allows you to grant access to outside users. You can use different combinations of the policy's component strings to customize your permissions for different purposes as required.
