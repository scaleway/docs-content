title: Support for custom Security groups in Kapsule/Kosmos
status: added

Starting now, users are able to provide a security group ID from their already existing SGs when creating a Kapsule pool. If no security group ID is provided, the pool will use a default preconfigured security group named “Kapsule default security group” shared between all the Kapsule pools in the same zone.
The older behaviour creating a magic Security group for each zone where the cluster had at least one pool is dropped.
