Managed Document Databases provide fully-managed document Database Instances, with FerretDB as a database engine.

Document databases enable users to store and retrieve data in a document format, such as `json`. Compared to traditional relational databases where data is stored in a table-like format, document-type storage supports storing multiple nested keys and values in each document key.

## How to create a database

1. Click **Document Databases** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu, if you do not have a Database Instance already created, the creation page displays.
2. Click **Create a Database Instance**. The creation wizard displays.
3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Select **FerretDB** as a database engine.
    - Choose a region. This is the geographical location where your database will be deployed.
    - Select a database configuration. You can choose between:
        - **High Availability**: creates a secondary node with an up-to-date replica of the database. If the primary Instance fails, the secondary takes over requests.
        - **Standalone**: creates a standalone database provisioned on a single node.
    - Select a node type.
    - Define the size of your Block Storage volume. You can increase your storage space without changing your node type, with no downtime. You can increase your volume to up to 10 TB.
    - Enable automatic backups, if necessary.
    - Add a name and set a password for your user.
    <Message type="important">
    Your username must adhere to specific criteria.
      - Length must be between 1 and 63 characters
      - First character must be an alphabetic character (**a-Za-Z**)
      - It can not start with **_rdb**
      - Only **a-zA-Z0-9_$-** characters are accepted
    </Message>
    - Enter a name for your Database Instance.
    - Tick the checkbox if you wish to share telemetry data with FerretDB.
    <Message type="important">
      This option is available during the Public Beta phase of Document Databases. It allows you to contribute with the FerretDB Open Source project. Only request types, such as find and aggregate, will be collected and shared. Request parameters or response content are neither collected nor shared. Refer to the official Ferret DB [documentation page on telemetry](https://docs.ferretdb.io/telemetry/) for more information.

4. Click **Create a Database Instance** to confirm your choices and launch creation.

    You are taken to the **Overview** tab for your Database Instance, where you can see information including the **Endpoint** to enable you to connect to it.

## Connect to your database

### Via database client

1. Click **Document Databases** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Click <Icon name="download" /> next to the **TLS certificate** to download it.
4. Transfer the file to where you will execute the connection command.
5. Copy the connection command located under **Connection** in the Database Instance information page.
6. Paste the connection command in your terminal, and edit the username field with the login you chose when creating the database. The full command should look like the following:
    ```bash
    mongosh --tls --tlsCAFile databaseinstancename.pem 'mongodb://username@ip:port/databasename?authMechanism=PLAIN'
    ```
    - `databaseinstancename.pem` - the TLS certificate downloaded on **step 3**.
    - `username` -  the username you defined upon Database Instance creation.
    - `ip` - your Database Instance's endpoint IP address.
    - `database instance name` - the database name you entered upon Database Instance creation. The default database name, generated when a name is not specified, always takes on the following format: `docdb-xxxxx-xxxx`.
    - `database name` - The default is called `rdb`. If you created a new database from the Databases tab inside your Database Instance, replace it with the database name.
    - `port` - the port on which your Database Instance is accessible
7. Enter your password.
If the connection is successful, you should see the following message display on your console, and be able to write queries:
    ```bash
    The server generated these startup warnings when booting
    Powered by FerretDB v0.9.0 and PostgreSQL 14.6.
    ```

### Via an application
1. Click **Document Databases** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Click <Icon name="download" /> next to the **TLS certificate** to download it.
4. Transfer the file to where you will execute the connection command.
5. Get the following connection information from the Database Instance information panel or the string displayed upon connection:
    - `username`: the username you defined upon Database Instance creation.
    - `password`: the user password you defined upon Database Instance creation.
    - `IP`: your Database Instance's endpoint IP address.
    - `port`: the port on which your Database Instance is accessible.
    - `cert_file_path`: the path to your Database Instance TLS certificate.
6. Enter the information above in your application configuration file.

    You can find examples below for Python, Node.js, and Go applications:

    #### Python

    The following code shows you how to use the `pymongo` library to connect using TLS.
    ```python
    from pymongo.mongo_client import MongoClient

    user_name      = "<replace_with_user_name>"
    password       = "<replace_with_password>"
    ip             = "instance_ip"
    port           = 1234
    cert_file_path ="<instance_certificate.crt>"

    # Estabish the tls connection:
    client = MongoClient(
            f'mongodb://{user_name}:{password}@{ip}:{port}',
            authMechanism='PLAIN',
            tls=True,
            tlsCAFile=cert_file_path,
        )
    # get the database you want to use
    db = client.rdb
    # get the collection cars
    cars = db["cars"]
    # prepare a new car to be inserted
    car = {"name": "Supercar", "price": 100000}
    # execute the insertion
    cars.insert_one(car)
    # read the car you just inserted
    car = cars.find_one()
    # print the car, it should contain an ObjectId
    print(car)
    ```


    #### Node.js

    The following code shows you how to use the `mongodb` module to connect using TLS.

    ```js
    const { MongoClient } = require("mongodb");

    userName     = "<replace_with_user_name>"
    password     = "<replace_with_password>"
    ip           = "instance_ip"
    port         = 1234
    certFilePath = "<instance_certificate.crt>"

    client = new MongoClient(
            `mongodb://${userName}:${password}@${ip}:${port}`, {
              tls: true,
              tlsCaFile: certFilePath,
              authMechanism: "PLAIN",
            })
    await client.connect();

    # get the database you want to use
    const db = client.db("rdb")
    # get the collection cars
    const cars = db.collection("cars")
    # prepare a new car to be inserted
    let car = {name: "Supercar", price: 100000}
    # execute the insertion
    cars.insertOne(car)
    # read the car you just inserted
    car = cars.findOne()
    # print the car, it should contain an ObjectId
    print(car)
    ```

    #### Go

    The following code shows you how to use the `mongo` driver to connect using TLS.
    ```go
    package main

    import (
        "context"
        "fmt"
        "go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo"
        "go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo/options"
    )

    func main() {

        username := "<replace_with_user_name>"
        password := "<replace_with_password>"
        host := "<endpoint ip>"
        port := 1234 // replace with endpoint port number
        caCertPath := "<instance_certificate.crt>"
        // prepare the uri for the connection
        uri := fmt.Sprintf(
            "mongodb://%s:%s@%s:%d/rdb?tls=true&tlsCACert=%s&authMechanism=PLAIN",
            username,
            password,
            host,
            port,
            caCertPath,
        )
        ctx := context.Background()
        // connect to the database
        client, _ := mongo.Connect(ctx, options.Client().ApplyURI(uri))
        // get the database
        db := client.Database("rdb")
        // get the collection
        cars := db.Collection("cars")
        // insert a document
        carToInsert := Car{Name: "Supercar", Year: 2020}
        cars.InsertOne(ctx, carToInsert)

        // read the document
        carToRead := Car{}
        cars.FindOne(ctx, map[string]interface{}{"name": "Supercar"}).Decode(&carToRead)

        // print the document
        fmt.Println(carToRead)

    }

    type Car struct {
        Name string
        Year int
    }
    ```
