## Problem

My Go Serverless Function build failed with an error message mentioning a wrong version.

## Cause

Go function deployment may fail during the build step with a version mismatch error, even if the runtime version appears to be correct.

This is due to the `go.mod` directive that specifies an `X.Y.Z` version where the `Z` patch version does not match the version of the selected runtime.

This happens by default because the `go mod init` command includes the full Go version (including the patch version), which can lead to this mismatch if your runtime only supports a different patch version.

## Possible solution

Remove the `Z` version from the `go.mod` file. In the example below, `X` corresponds to `1`, `Y` to `24`, and `Z` to `1`.

Content of a `go.mod` file with an incorrect `X.Y.Z` (`1.24.1`) version.

```
go 1.24.1
```

The example below shows the content of the `go.mod` file after we have remove the incorrect `Z` version:

```
go 1.24
````
