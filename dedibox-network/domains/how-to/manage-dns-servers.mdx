<Message type="important">
  This documentation applies to the legacy domain product previously offered by Online.net. For managing your domain names with the latest features, we recommend using Scaleway's [Domains and DNS](/docs/network/domains-and-dns/quickstart/) service.
</Message>

A DNS server is a program that responds to requests for DNS zones configured by the administrator. DNS servers typically operate in pairs, each consisting of a primary and secondary server.

Scaleway Dedibox's DNS servers are as follows:

  * Primary server:     ns0.online.net   (`195.154.228.249`)
  * Secondary server:   ns1.online.net   (`62.210.16.9`)

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- A domain name

## How to find the nameservers and the registrar of your domain

1. Go to [http://who.is](http://who.is).
2. Enter your domain name in the format **yourdomain.ext** (no www).
3. In the results, look at the **Registrar Info** and **Name Servers**.

## How to configure Dedibox DNS servers for your domain

### If you ordered your domain name with Scaleway

If you ordered your domain name with Scaleway, your domain automatically configures to our DNS servers. No further action is required from you.

### If your domain name is registered elsewhere

You can still use your Dedibox web hosting, and ask your registrar to change your domain’s DNS zones.

## How to change your DNS servers

<Message type="important">
  Changing DNS servers or zones must be done by experts.

  We do not provide support for Scaleway webhostings and domain names if the DNS servers have been modified by the user.
</Message>

1. From the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net), click **Domain**. A list of your domains displays.
2. Click **Configure domain name** next to the relevant domain.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-domain-configure.webp" />
3. Click the **Manage DNS servers** tab.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-change-dns.webp" />
4. Modify the DNS servers to your requirements.
    <Message type="important">
      The DNS zone must be configured on the new server before the change in the console.
      If you have an error such as “SOA not found”, we invite you to check this with your provider.
