Jitsi Meet serves as an open-source video conferencing solution, designed to facilitate virtual meetings for remote teams. The software emphasizes quality in both video and audio performance and ensures security through fully encrypted connections, employing TLS/SSL protocols and [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificates.

Jitsi Meet provides features such as:

* **Desktop and content sharing:** Facilitate meetings by sharing desktops, presentations, and other content.
* **Simplified conference invitations:** Invite participants to your conference using a straightforward, custom URL.
* **Collaborative document editing:** Enhance collaboration by editing documents in real-time using Etherpad during meetings.
* **Integrated chat with messaging and emojis:** Support communication by exchanging messages and emojis within the video conferencing interface. Jitsi Meet features a user-friendly chat function to facilitate interactions.

In summary, Jitsi Meet provides a competitive alternative to commercial solutions, offering advanced features with a focus on security for remote teams in need of a reliable video conferencing solution.

## Installing Jitsi Meet

1. [Connect to your Instance via SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/).
2. Configure the hostname of the server corresponding to your domain / subdomain name. Replace `jitsi.mydomain.tld` with the subdomain pointed to your Instance.
    ```
    hostnamectl set-hostname jitsi
    sed -i 's/^127.0.1.1.*$/127.0.1.1 jitsi.mydomain.tld jitsi/g' /etc/hosts
    ```
3. Update the software already installed on the system:
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
4. Install a [Nginx](https://nginx.org) server before installing Jitsi Meet. The Nginx server will serve as a reverse proxy for the Jitsi web interface. The Jitsi installation tool will take care of the configuration of Nginx, if it is present on the system. Run the following commands to install and enable Nginx:
    ```
    apt install -y nginx
    systemctl start nginx.service
    systemctl enable nginx.service
    ```

    <Message type="important">
        If Nginx or Apache is not present on the system, Jitsi Meet will automatically install [Jetty](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) during the installation.

5. Download the APT key and setup the repositories of Jitsi, to install the software with `apt`.
    ```
    wget -qO - https://download.jitsi.org/jitsi-key.gpg.key | apt-key add -
    sh -c "echo 'deb https://download.jitsi.org stable/' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jitsi-stable.list"
    apt update -y
    ```
6. Launch the installation of Jitsi Meet.
    ```
    apt install -y jitsi-meet
    ```

  During the installation you will be prompted to:

    - Enter the FQDN of your Instance. For example `jitsi.mydomain.tld` and press **Enter**:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-jitsi_hostname.webp" alt="" />

    - Choose the SSL certificate option `Generate a new self-signed certificate (You will later get a chance to obtain a Let's Encrypt certificate)` and press **Enter**.
7. Run the script `/usr/share/jitsi-meet/scripts/install-letsencrypt-cert.sh` to obtain a [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) SSL certificate for your Instance:
    ```
    /usr/share/jitsi-meet/scripts/install-letsencrypt-cert.sh
    ```

  During the certificate request, you are asked to enter your e-mail address to receive notifications regarding your certificate.
8. Your private Jitsi Meet Instance is ready for a first conference call. Open a Web-browser and type the FQDN of your Instance, for example: `https://jitsi.mydomain.tld`. The following screen will appear:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-jitsi_home.webp" alt="" />

  Enter a name for your conference and press `Go` to enter the conference room. It is now possible to share the link, to set a password, configure the audio and video quality and more for the conference.
    <Message type="important">
        Jitsi requires access to your camera and microphone. Authorize the use of these devices on your computer when prompted to do so by your web browser.
