## What are Elastic Metal servers?

An Elastic Metal server is a 100%-dedicated machine without a hypervisor, available in a cloud ecosystem. With Elastic Metal, you get full control of the resources and applications installed on the server, for maximum performance and security.

Several operating systems are available for [automatic installation from the console](/compute/elastic-metal/how-to/install-server/).

## What is the difference between an Elastic Metal server and a Dedicated Server (Dedibox)?

Dedibox is our historical dedicated server range, only available with monthly billing. Elastic Metal is an improved and more flexible offer, giving all the same features with flexible hourly billing, cloud integration and much more.

## How am I billed for Elastic Metal servers?

Elastic Metal servers are available on two different billing plans: hourly or monthly. In both cases, you will receive a monthly invoice calculated at the end of each month and based on your resource usage during the month (number of hours used if you selected hourly billing, or the monthly price if you selected monthly billing). However, to benefit from the more advantageous monthly pricing, you will pay a one-time commitment fee equivalent to one month of subscription. To reward your long term commitment, if you rent your Elastic Metal server for more than 12 months, we will give you Scaleway cloud credits equivalent to your commitment fee.

## Why is Elastic Metal offered with either monthly or hourly billing? Which should I choose? 

Choosing an hourly-billed dedicated server allows you to take advantage of both the flexibility of the public cloud and the power of a dedicated server. This can be ideal for use during periods of peak activity or one-off events.

If you need a powerful server on a frequent and continual basis, you may find that monthly billing is more suitable for you. In this case you will get a more advantageous price, while still benefiting from full integration with our public cloud to manage sporadic exceptional workloads or peak periods.

## What are the differences between the different Elastic Metal Server ranges?

We provide several ranges of Elastic Metal servers, each of them designed to meet the requirements of your different workloads:

- **Aluminium**: Fully dedicated Elastic Metal servers with native cloud integration, at the best price
- **Beryllium**: Powerful, balanced and reliable servers for production-grade applications
- **Lithium**: Designed with huge local storage to store, back up, and protect your data

## How long does it take to boot an Elastic Metal server?

An Elastic Metal server is delivered to your account within a few minutes. You can then launch the server installation with a few simple clicks. The OS installation can take up to one hour.

## Which OSes can be installed on Elastic Metal servers?

We provide a range of Linux distributions for automatic installation from the Scaleway console.

In addition, Windows will be available shortly for monthly servers.

## How can I reinstall an Elastic Metal server?

You can reinstall an Elastic Metal server with a few clicks at any time, [directly from your management console](/compute/elastic-metal/how-to/install-server/).

## How do I back up an Elastic Metal server?

Elastic Metal servers must be backed up differently to Instances which have the snapshot feature. 

The first level is to back up the your Elastic Metal server's data and configuration. This can be done by exporting to an [Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/quickstart/). You can also check out our tutorial on [backing up servers to Object Storage](/tutorials/backup-dedicated-server-s3-duplicity/) for more information.

The security and redundancy of your data can also be ensured by a cluster configuration of your application.

If you need a backup system, you can check documentation for your OS, for example  OS documentation, for example the information on snapshots [here](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lvm).

## Can I make changes to the BIOS settings or update the firmware of an Elastic Metal server?

Users are not permitted to modify BIOS settings of Elastic Metal servers. Any modification may lead to a malfunction of the system resulting in your data becoming unavailable. Firmware updates are managed by Scaleway Elements. In the case of your Elastic Metal server requiring a firmware upgrade, it will be installed automatically upon reboot of the server.

## What happens to the data stored on the disks when I delete the server?

After deletion, all data present on the disks of an Elastic Metal server is wiped using a secure algorithm. Make sure to back up your data before deleting a server, as data cannot be recovered once the disks are wiped.

## Can I move flexible IPs between my Elastic Metal servers and my Instances?

It is not currently possible to move your flexible IPs between your different Scaleway Elements products. Each set of flexible IPs that you hold is independent, and usable only with that product. Instance flexible IPs cannot be attached to Elastic Metal servers and vice versa.

## How many flexible IPs can I have per Elastic Metal server?

You can have up to 64 [flexible IPs](/compute/elastic-metal/how-to/order-flexible-ip/) per Elastic Metal server.
