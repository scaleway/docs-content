## How to connect to your deployment

### Connecting using the ClickHouse® HTTP console

1. From the Data Warehouse for ClickHouse® deployments page, click the name of the deployment you want to want to connect to. The **Overview** tab displays.

2. Click the **ClickHouse® HTTP console** button. A new tab containing the console displays.

3. In the top corner of the ClickHouse® HTTP console, replace the `default` login with `scwadmin`.

4. Enter the password you set up during the creation of your deployment.

5. Run the command below to display the current version of ClickHouse® and make sure you are connected to your deployment.

  ```sql
  SELECT version();
  ```

You can now execute SQL commands.

### Connecting using the ClickHouse® CLI

1. From the Data Warehouse for ClickHouse® deployments page, click the name of the deployment you want to want to connect to. The **Overview** tab displays.

2. Click the **Connect** button next to **Frameworks** in the **Connect to your deployment** section. The connection wizard displays. 

    <Message type="note">
    To connect your deployment with BI tools, refer to the [dedicated documentation](/data-warehouse/how-to/connect-bi-tools/).
    </Message>

3. Copy the ClickHouse® CLI command, and execute it in a terminal to connect to your deployment. Make sure to replace the placeholders beforehand.

    ```sh
    clickhouse client \
    --host <YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_ID>.dtwh.<REGION>.scw.cloud \
    --port 9440 \
    --secure \
    --user scwadmin \
    --password '<YOUR_PASSWORD>' \
    ```

You are now connected to your Data Warehouse for ClickHouse® deployment and can perform SQL queries.

### Creating a database and ingesting data

1. Run the command below to create a new table in the default database:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE sensors
    (
        sensor_id UInt16,
        sensor_type Enum('BME280', 'BMP180', 'BMP280', 'DHT22', 'DS18B20', 'HPM', 'HTU21D', 'PMS1003', 'PMS3003', 'PMS5003', 'PMS6003', 'PMS7003', 'PPD42NS', 'SDS011'),
        location UInt32,
        lat Float32,
        lon Float32,
        timestamp DateTime,
        P1 Float32,
        P2 Float32,
        P0 Float32,
        durP1 Float32,
        ratioP1 Float32,
        durP2 Float32,
        ratioP2 Float32,
        pressure Float32,
        altitude Float32,
        pressure_sealevel Float32,
        temperature Float32,
        humidity Float32,
        date Date MATERIALIZED toDate(timestamp)
    )
    ENGINE = MergeTree
    ORDER BY (timestamp, sensor_id);

    ```

2. Insert data in the table you just created:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO sensors
        SELECT *
        FROM s3Cluster(
            'default',
            'https://datawarehouse-samples.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/2019-06_bmp180.csv.zst',
            'CSVWithNames',
            $$ sensor_id UInt16,
            sensor_type String,
            location UInt32,
            lat Float32,
            lon Float32,
            timestamp DateTime,
            P1 Float32,
            P2 Float32,
            P0 Float32,
            durP1 Float32,
            ratioP1 Float32,
            durP2 Float32,
            ratioP2 Float32,
            pressure Float32,
            altitude Float32,
            pressure_sealevel Float32,
            temperature Float32,
            humidity Float32 $$
        )
    SETTINGS
        format_csv_delimiter = ';',
        input_format_allow_errors_ratio = '0.5',
        input_format_allow_errors_num = 10000,
        input_format_parallel_parsing = 0,
        date_time_input_format = 'best_effort',
        max_insert_threads = 32,
        parallel_distributed_insert_select = 1;

    ```

### Querying the database

1. Run the command below to count the rows you inserted in the table:
    ```sql
    SELECT count()
    FROM sensors;
    ```

2. Run the command below to list the 10 first rows of your table:
    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM sensors
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

3. Run the command below to display the storage used by the `sensors` table:
    ```sql
    SELECT
        disk_name,
        formatReadableSize(sum(data_compressed_bytes) AS size) AS compressed,
        formatReadableSize(sum(data_uncompressed_bytes) AS usize) AS uncompressed,
        round(usize / size, 2) AS compr_rate,
        sum(rows) AS rows,
        count() AS part_count
    FROM system.parts
    WHERE (active = 1) AND (table = 'sensors')
    GROUP BY
        disk_name
    ORDER BY size DESC;
    ```
