An Instance is a virtual machine in the cloud. Scaleway supports several [types of Instances](/instances/reference-content/choosing-instance-type/), each with their own set of resources, unique value propositions, and technical specifications. Each Instance supports the essential operating systems and distributions, as well as customized [Instantapps](/instances/concepts/#instantapp).

## POP2 Instances

Scaleway's **General Purpose** range includes POP2 Instances, which are high-end, dedicated cloud Instances for demanding workloads. They offer the highest consistent performance per core to support real-time applications. In addition, their computing power makes them generally more robust for compute-intensive workloads.

They are best suited for production websites, demanding applications, high-traffic databases, and any application that requires 100% sustained CPU usage such as monitoring and analytics software. This includes Prometheus and Grafana, gaming sessions, and ad serving.
