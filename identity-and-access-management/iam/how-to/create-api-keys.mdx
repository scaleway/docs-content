API keys are unique identifiers necessary to use the [Scaleway API](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/). You can generate API keys for yourself or for an [IAM application](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#application) via the Scaleway console. Each API key is scoped to one [Organization](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#organization) only (so if you are part of multiple Organizations, you will need a different API key for each one). Each user and application can have multiple API keys in each Organization.

API keys always inherit the permissions of their bearer (the IAM user or IAM application with which they are associated), giving that bearer the exact rights and permissions that have been defined for them in the Organization via [policies](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#policy).

<Message type="important">
  - You can only generate API keys for yourself, and (if you are the Organization Owner or have [IAMManager permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/) for IAM applications. You cannot generate API keys for other IAM users, regardless of your permissions.
  - You can attach API keys to your own user to test and access your infrastructure, but we do not recommend this for all use cases.
</Message>

<Message type="tip">
  If you plan to create API keys that will be used for a long period of time, in production for example, we recommend that you use [applications](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#applications) as the bearers of these API keys. This way, the API keys are linked to non-human users, and are under no risk of leaving or being removed from the Organization.

## How to generate an API key for yourself 

1. Click **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** from the top-right of your [**Organization Dashboard**](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) in the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) displays.

2. Click your name in the list of users. You are taken to your user dashboard.1. Click **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** from the top-right of your [**Organization Dashboard**](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) in the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-iam-dashboard.webp" alt="" />
2. Click your name in the list of users. You are taken to your user dashboard.
4. Click the <Icon name="plus" /> button to generate a new API key. The following screen pops up:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-generate-api-key.webp" alt="" />
5. Enter an optional description for your API key, and select a preferred Project for Object Storage.
    <Message type="note">
      Preferred Projects for Object Storage - When creating and/or listing Object Storage buckets via the API, there is no available parameter to specify the Project in which you wish to list or create buckets. All buckets you create via the API will therefore be created in the preferred Project you choose when creating the API key. Similarly, when listing buckets, buckets from your preferred Project will be listed.
      Note that:
        - This only applies to the creation and/or listing of Object Storage buckets, and no other products or resources.
        - You can still create and/or list buckets in your Project of choice via the Scaleway console.
      See our [dedicated documentation](/identity-and-access-management/iam/api-cli/using-api-key-object-storage/) for more information.

6. Click **Generate API Key**. A screen displays showing the access key and secret key for your new API key and reminding you that this is your only chance to securely save the secret key:

7. Ensure you have securely saved the secret key, then close the window. You are returned to the **Credentials** tab, where your new API key now appears in the list.

## How to create an API key for an IAM application

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You are the Owner of your Organization, or an IAM user in an Organization where you have the [IAMManager or OrganizationManager](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/manage-users/#how-to-view-and-delete-user-api-keys) permission set.

1. Click **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** from the top-right of your [Organization Dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) in the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/applications) displays.
