## Problem

My Database Instance is not performing as expected.

## Possible causes

- High data loads
- High incoming traffic from specific apps or websites
- Sub-optimized Redis™ commands

## Solution

You can [monitor usage metrics on Cockpit](/managed-databases-for-redis/how-to/monitor-redis-databases-cockpit) to check if the usage is nominal.

The Database Instance can be impacted by high data loads or unexpected high traffic from an app or website, for example. You can [scale up your Instance](/managed-databases-for-redis/how-to/scale-up-a-database-for-redis) if necessary.
