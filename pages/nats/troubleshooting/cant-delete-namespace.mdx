## I can't delete my Project due to a Messaging namespace

You may be trying to delete a Scaleway [Project](/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project), and encounter an error message telling you that the Project cannot be deleted due to an existing Messaging namespace.

### Cause

The Project is still detecting a legacy namespace resource, dating from the time before NATS, Queues and Topics and Events were split into three separate products and the namespace resource was retired.

### Solution

Try the following steps:

1. In the Scaleway console, check that you have no remaining resources in either of the [NATS](https://console.scaleway.com/nats/), [Queues](https://console.scaleway.com/queues/), or [Topics and Events](https://console.scaleway.com/topics-events/) sections. **Make sure to check for resources in all regions by using the regional drop-down menu.**

2. If you have delete all resources for these three products and the problem persists, [open a support ticket](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create) to request manual deletion of the phantom namespace.
