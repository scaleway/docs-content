## Synology Hyper Backup - Overview

[Synology Hyper Backup](https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/feature/hyper_backup) is a solution to backup your Synology NAS easily on Scaleway Elements Object Storage.

A NAS is a network connected device housing one or several hard disks to store all your photos, music, videos and other data. The device is sitting in your home network. With different access rights, you can grant access to anyone in your network or make your files available by sharing them over your Internet connection.

As the NAS holds huge amounts of your personal data, a good backup strategy is important. Synology has developed an application called Hyper Backup which allows automatizing the backup of their NAS devices on several external media. These media include external devices, another Synology NAS, a rsync server, or a public cloud service like [Scaleway Elements Object Storage](https://www.scaleway.com/en/object-storage/).
