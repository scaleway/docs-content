To enable quick testing of Serverless Containers, we have added the **Quickstart image** option, which deploys a sample image to help you test the service. 

Additionally, we have worked on several minor improvements for a better user experience:

- From the Serverless Container list in namespaces, you can now access the logs and metrics of a container  
- Creation and last edit dates are now displayed in the overview  
- Fixed an issue when deploying Serverless Containers from the Container Registry
