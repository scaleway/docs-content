- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## Problem

I cannot delete my Scaleway Object Storage bucket.

## Solution

Make sure there is no [bucket policy](/storage/object/concepts/#bucket-policy) that prevents you from deleting the bucket. If there is one, make sure that it [explicitly allows you](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/) to perform the desired action.

Consider the following:

- The effective deletion of the bucket will start 24 hours after the deletion request.
- The bucket name will then be available for other customers to use.
- We recommend you erase all objects and versions in the bucket before requesting the deletion
- Files larger than 1 GB can take longer to be deleted.

Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/storage/object/how-to/delete-a-bucket/) for more information on how to delete a bucket.
