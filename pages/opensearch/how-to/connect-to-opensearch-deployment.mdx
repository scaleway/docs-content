## How to connect to a Cloud Essentials for OpenSearch deployment

### How to connect to OpenSearch Dashboards

1. Click **OpenSearch** in the **Databases** section of the console. The Cloud Essentials for OpenSearch dashboard displays.

2. Click the name of the OpenSearch deployment you want to connect to. Its **Overview** page displays.

3. Click the **OpenSearch dashboard** button.

4. Enter the credentials set up during deployment creation, then click **Log in**. 

You are now connected to your Cloud Essentials for OpenSearch deployment. Refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.opensearch.org/2.19/dashboards/) for comprehensive information on how to use OpenSearch Dashboards.

### How to communicate with a deployment using the OpenSearch REST API

1. Click **OpenSearch** in the **Databases** section of the console. The Cloud Essentials for OpenSearch dashboard displays.

2. Click the name of the OpenSearch deployment you want to connect to. Its **Overview** page displays.

3. From the **Network** section of the **Overview** page, copy the **API** endpoint.

4. In a terminal, run the following command to interact with your deployment. Remember to replace the placeholders with the appropriate values:

    ```sh
    curl -X GET "<deployment_api_endpoint>/_cluster/health" -ku <username>:<password>
    ```

    An output similar to the following displays:

    ```json
    {
      "cluster_name": "os-43995940-b3b2-4dd9-ae0f-799417ed3ec6",
      "status": "green",
      "timed_out": false,
      "number_of_nodes": 1,
      "number_of_data_nodes": 1,
      "discovered_master": true,
      "discovered_cluster_manager": true,
      "active_primary_shards": 7,
      "active_shards": 7,
      "active_shards_percent_as_number": 100
    }
    ```

You can now interact with your Cloud Essentials for OpenSearch deployment via its API endpoint. Refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/getting-started/communicate/) for comprehensive information on how to communicate with OpenSearch using the REST API.
