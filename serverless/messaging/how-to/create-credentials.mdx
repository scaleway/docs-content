This page shows how to create Messaging and Queuing [credentials](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#credentials), which give their bearer (e.g. services and platforms) access to your Messaging and Queuing service. The process of creating credentials differs depending on the messaging protocol ([NATS](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#nats), [SQS](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#sns) or [SNS](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#sns)).

You can create multiple sets of credentials for each of your Messaging and Queuing services.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created a NATS account or activated SQS/SNS](/serverless/messaging/how-to/get-started/)
</Message>

## How to create credentials for a NATS account

Credentials for NATS accounts are not granular: they necessarily give full read and write access. The bearer of these credentials can publish and receive messages, as well as manage topics and streams, for this account.

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of Messaging and Queuing protocols displays.

2. Use the drop-down menu to select the [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) of the NATS account for which you want to create credentials.

3. Click **NATS**. The list of your NATS accounts in the pre-selected region displays.

4. Click the NATS account you want to generate credentials for. The account's **Overview** page displays.

5. In the **Credentials** panel, click **Generate credentials**. A pop-up displays.

6. Enter a name for these credentials, and click **Generate credentials**.

    The credentials are created and a button displays prompting you to download them in a `.creds` file.

    <Message type="important">
      The generated credentials are displayed only once. Make sure to download and safely store them before closing the window.
    </Message>

7. Click **Download** and save the file, before closing the window.

    You are returned to your NATs account's overview page. The name of your newly-generated credentials and their access level is displayed in the **Credentials** panel.

## How to create credentials for SQS or SNS

Credentials for SQS or SNS are granular: you can define the level of access that they should give.

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of Messaging and Queuing protocols displays.

2. Use the drop-down menu to select the [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) in which you want to create credentials.

3. Click **SQS** or **SNS** depending on which service you want to create credentials for.

4. Click **Generate credentials**. A pop-up displays, such as the one below for SQS.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-generate-creds-sqs.webp" alt="" />

5. Enter a name for these credentials.

6. Select the required permissions for the credentials. You must choose at least one of **Write**, **Read** and **Manage**. You are free to select any combination of these permissions. 

7. Click **Generate credentials**.

    The credentials are created. The access key and secret key are displayed, and you are invited to copy them.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-sqs-sns-creds-generated.webp" alt="" />
    
    <Message type="important">
      This is your only chance to view and save the secret key. Make sure that you copy it and save it somewhere securely.
    </Message>

8. Copy and save the credentials, before closing the window.

    You are returned to your Messaging and Queuing SQS or SNS service's **Credentials** tab. The name of your newly-generated credentials, along with the access key and access level are displayed.
