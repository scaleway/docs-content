If you want to set up [managed TLS/SSL offloading](/network/load-balancer/how-to/setup-ssl-offloading/) on your Load Balancer, you can do so using either **Let’s Encrypt Certificates** or **third party TLS/SSL Certificates**, generated by yourself or any other certificate authority. This document shows you how to create your own self-signed TLS certificate to use with your Load Balancer.

[Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security), or TLS for short, is a common security protocol designed to increase privacy and data security for communications over the Internet. TLS uses a digital certificate to validate the public encryption key provided by a device on the Internet with its private counterpart.

## How to create a self-signed TLS certificate

A self-signed certificate can be issued easily on any computer using the `openssl` tool.

1. Run the following command from the command line to generate a private key file and a CSR file:
	```
	openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout private_key.txt -out csr.txt -subj "/C=FR/ST=Ile-de-France/L=Paris/O=MyInternetCompanyLTD/CN=www.example.com"
	```
	The following subcommands are used with the `openssl` base command:
	- `req`: This subcommand specifies the use of the X.509 certificate signing request (CSR) management.
	- `newkey rsa: 4096`:  This subcommand specifies the creation of a new key and certificate at the same time using a 4096 bit long RSA key.
	- `nodes`: This option tells OpenSSL to skip the securisation of the certificate using a passphrase.
	- `keyout`: This subcommand defines the location and file name of the private key file
	- `out`: This specifies the path and file name of the generated certificate request.
	- `sub`: The subject for the certficate. Modify the values of these subcommand to your requirements. The **Common Name** (CN) represents the domain name you are issuing the certificate for.

2. Generate a file containing all **Subject Alternative Names** (SAN) for the certificate. They include websites, IP addresses, common names, etc. They are protected by a single SSL Certificate. 

3. Create a new file called `alt_names.txt`, open it in a text editor and edit the file as follows. Make sure to add all domain names and IP addresses that should be protected by the certificate.
	```
	subjectAltName=DNS:example.com,DNS:www.example.com
	```

4. Save the file and exit the text editor.

5. Generate the self-signed certficate using the `openssl` tool:
	```
	openssl x509 -req -extfile alt_names.txt -sha256 -days 365 -in csr.txt -signkey private_key.txt  -out certificate.txt
	```

6. Check that you have the following files in your folder with the `ls` command.
	- `csr.txt`: The certficate request
	- `private_key.txt`: The private key for the certificate
	- `certificate.txt`: The public key for the certificate

## How to import a self-signed certificate with Scaleway Load Balancers

Follow the instructions for [configuring TLS/SSL offloading using a third party TLS/SSL certificate](/network/load-balancer/how-to/setup-ssl-offloading/#how-to-configure-tlsssl-offloading-using-a-third-party-tlsssl-certificate), pasting the full PEM-formatted certificate from step 5 into the box when prompted.

The new TLS certificate displays in the list of available certificates, and you can use it with your Load Balancer.
