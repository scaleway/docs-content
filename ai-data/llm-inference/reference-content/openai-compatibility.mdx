You can use the [OpenAI Python client library](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) to interact with your Scaleway LLM Inference deployment. 
This feature is especially beneficial for those looking to seamlessly transition applications already utilizing OpenAI.

## Usage

**cURL**: To invoke Scaleway LLM Inference's OpenAI-compatible API, simply change the provided endpoint as:
```
https://<Deployment UUID>.ifr.fr-par.scw.cloud/v1/chat/completions
```

**OpenAI Python client library**: Use OpenAI's SDK how you normally would.

### Chat Completions API

The Chat Completions API is designed for models fine-tuned for conversational tasks (such as X-chat, X-instruct variants).

```
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url='https://<Deployment UUID>.ifr.fr-par.scw.cloud/v1/',
    api_key='<IAM API key>'
)

chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {   "role": "system", 
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Sing me a song about Scaleway"
        }
    ],
    model='<Model name>' #e.g 'llama-3-8b-instruct'
)

print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

  More OpenAI-like APIs (e.g embeddings, audio) will be released step by step once related models are supported.

### Supported parameters

- `messages` (required)
- `model` (required)
- `max_tokens`
- `temperature`
- `top_p`
- `presence_penalty`
- `logprobs`
- `stop`
- `seed`
- `stream`

### Unsupported parameters

Currently, the following options are not supported:

- `response_format`
- `frequency_penalty`
- `n`
- `top_logprobs`
- `tools`
- `tool_choice`
- `logit_bias`
- `user`

If you have a use case requiring one of these unsupported features, please [contact us via Slack](https://slack.scaleway.com/).

## Future developments

This documentation covers the initial phase of experimental support for the OpenAI API. 
Gradually, we plan to introduce additional APIs such as:

- Embeddings API
- Images API
- Audio API

<Message type="note">
  We will progressively roll out more OpenAI-like APIs as we expand model support.
