The flow programming Kickstart sets up a ready-to-use [NodeRED](https://nodered.org/) Instance to visually create your IoT applications without a single line of code. 
NodeRED lets you connect functional building blocks together to perform actions on events, events can be messages received on your IoT Hub.

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have [created an IoT Hub](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/create-hub)
- You have [installed `mosquitto`](https://mosquitto.org/download/) on your local computer

## How to create the Flow Programming Kickstart 

1. Create a new [Flow Programming purpose Kickstart](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/create-kickstart) from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/iot-hub/kickstarts/create). 
<Lightbox src="assets/scaleway-flow-programming-purpose-kickstart.webp" alt="" />

2. Select the IoT Hub and device to use with the Kickstart.
  <Message type="important">

  Currently only devices supporting insecure connections are allowed for this IoT Kickstart.

3. Choose the geographical region to deploy your Kickstart. 

4. Set a password for the Kickstart's dashboard. 

5. Click **Create a Kickstart** to launch the installation of the software stack. 


## How to use the Flow Programming Kickstart 

A very simple application will be provisioned for you. It simply outputs any message's contents to NodeRED debug panel.
To achieve this, an `MQTT input` "node" (with the correct settings) is connected to a `debug` "node".

1. Click **IoT Hub** in the **IoT Station** section of the side menu. The list of your IoT Hubs displays.

2. Click the name of the IoT Hub you want to configure. The hub's overview page displays.

3. Click **Devices** to display the configuration of the device.

4. Click **Add devices** in the devices tab. The **Create a Device** wizard displays.

5. Enter a name for the device and **allow** insecure connections.

6. Click **Add a Device to your Hub**. The details of the device display. Take a note of the **Device ID**:

## How to access the NodeRED panel

1. Open a web browser on your local computer and point it to the NodeRED web interface at `http://<your_flow_programming_instance_ip>:1880`.  Log into the panel using the password set during the Kickstart creation. 

2. Go to the debug panel by clicking on the "bug" icon, on the top right of your screen. 

3. Open a terminal on your local computer and run the following command: 
    ```
    mosquitto_pub -h iot.fr-par.scw.cloud -i <device id> -t my/first/topic -m "Hello NodeRED."
    ```
    <Message type="note">

    The Endpoint `iot-fr-par.scw.cloud` may vary, you find your endpoint on the Hub's network page.

    </Message>

  The command above contains the following elements:

    - `-h`: The **endpoint** or host of your IoT Hub. You require it to communicate with your hub.
    - `-i`: The **device ID** of your device. You can retrieve it from the **Devices** section of your hub. 
    - `-t`: The **thread** to send your message to. 
    - `-m`: The **message** containing the information you want to transmit.
4. Return to the NodeRED debug panel, the message should be displayed:.

Now you can create your own application to suit your needs. Check out the official [NodeRED documentation](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/) for more information.
