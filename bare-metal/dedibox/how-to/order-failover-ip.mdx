Failover IP addresses allow you to have several IPs on the same server. You could then, for example, have one IP for each website or virtual machine hosted on the server.
Each failover IP can be routed to any of your Dedibox servers at any time in just a few minutes by using the Scaleway console or the API. By switching your failover IP addresses from one server to another, the hosted services remain available without reconfiguring the IP address.

Failover IPs can be bought as single IP addresses with a maximum number of IPs per Dedibox server, depending on your offer or as /27 IP blocks for Dedibox servers having Business service level.

1. Click **Dedibox** in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu.
2. Click the **Failover IPs** tab to display a list of your failover IPs.
3. Click **+ Order a failover IP**. A pop-up displays.
4. Choose the number of failover IPs you want to order. If you have servers with Business service level, you can also order /27 IP blocks.

      You can order up to 10 addresses at a time.
    </Message>
5. Click **Order failover IP** to validate your order.

    The failover IP is being delivered into your account and displays in the list of failover IPs.
