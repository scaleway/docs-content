Optimize your deliverability and improve your reputation score with our new automatic blocklist feature. Addresses that consistently generate hard bounces (mailbox not found, mailbox full) are automatically blocked to prevent them from affecting your email performance.

Refer to the [How to manage blocklists](/transactional-email/how-to/manage-blocklists) documentation page for more information.
