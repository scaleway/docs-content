You can split your IPv6 prefix into several subnets and use them on your Dedibox servers both in Paris and Amsterdam. Each subnet has its own [DUID](/dedibox-network/ipv6/concepts/#duid) and can be configured individually.

<Message type="note">
  * You can create as many /56 subnets as you have servers.
  * You can create as many /64 subnets as you have failover IPs.

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- A [Dedibox dedicated server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox)
- [Requested](/dedibox-network/ipv6/how-to/request-prefix) a /48 IPv6 prefix

1. Click **Server** > **Network configuration** in the Dedibox console. The network configuration pages displays. Scroll down to the IPv6 network configuration section.
2. Click the settings icon (cogwheel) next to your `/48` prefix. Then click **Create subnet**.

3. Select the subnet you want to create from the drop-down list. Then click **Create subnet**.

    The subnet is created and visible in the list of your IPv6 subnets along with its DUID.

  To create `/64` networks for virtual machines, repeat the steps above by clicking on the "cogweel" icon next to the `/56` subnet.
