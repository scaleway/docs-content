Regional Private Networks allow you to create Private Networks that are scoped to a region (Paris, Amsterdam or Warsaw), rather than a specific [Availability Zone](/compute/instances/concepts/#availability-zone) (AZ). This means you can attach resources from multiple AZs of that region, to your Private Network.

Find the full documentation for the VPC API at [developers.scaleway.com](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/).

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created an API key](/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key/)
</Message>

## Creating new regional Private Networks from scratch

1. Create a regional Private Network for the Paris region via the API:

    <Message type="tip">
    You can find the Project ID in your Scaleway console at the URL `https://console.scaleway.com/<project-name>/settings`.
    </Message>

    ```
    POST https://api.scaleway.com/vpc/v2/regions/fr-par/private-networks 
    
    {"name": "<name>", "project_id": "<Project ID>"}
    ```

    Note the Private Network ID `(pn-id)` of the created Private Network.

2. Create resources of your choice (e.g. Instances, Elastic Metal servers, Public Gateways etc) either via the console or the API. Make sure you save the resource ID after creation. For example, [create an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) and note the Instance ID (`server-id` in the API).

3. Attach the resource to the regional Private Network you created, via the API. For an Instance, use the following API call:

    ```
    POST https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/<az>/servers/<server-id>/private_nics
    
    {"private_network_id":"<pn-id>"}
    ```

    The resource is now attached to the regional Private Network.

To list all of your regional Private Networks, use the following API call:

    ```
    GET https://api.scaleway.com/vpc/v2/regions/fr-par/private-networks
    ```

## Migrating existing zonal Private Networks to regional Private Networks 

To migrate all the Private Networks in an Organization, use the following API call:

    ```
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.scaleway.com/vpc/v2/regions/<region>/private-networks/migrate-zonal \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --header 'X-Auth-Token: <SCW_SECRET_KEY>' \
      --data '{ 
      "organization_id": "<Organization-ID>"
    }'
    ```

To migrate all the Private Networks in a given Project, use the following API call:

    ```
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.scaleway.com/vpc/v2/regions/<region>/private-networks/migrate-zonal \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --header 'X-Auth-Token: <SCW_SECRET_KEY>' \
      --data '{ 
      "project_id": "<Project-ID>"
    }'
    ```

To migrate only certain Private Networks, use the following API call:


    ```
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.scaleway.com/vpc/v2/regions/<region>/private-networks/migrate-zonal \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --header 'X-Auth-Token: <SCW_SECRET_KEY>' \
      --data '{ 
      "private_network_ids": [
        "<Private-Network-ID>",
        "<Private-Network-ID>"
      ]
    }'
    ```

A successful reply to any of these calls will be `204 no content`.
