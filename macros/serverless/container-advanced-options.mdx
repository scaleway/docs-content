In the **Advanced options** section, set the following:

<Tabs>
    <TabsTab label="Data">
    - Declare [environment variables](/serverless-containers/concepts/#environment-variables) you want to inject into your container. For each environment variable, click **+Add variable** and enter the key/value pair.
    - Declare [secrets](/serverless-containers/concepts/#secrets) for your container. Secrets are environment variables that are injected into your container, but the values are not retained or displayed by Scaleway after initial validation.
        <Message type="note">
        Encode your environment variables and secrets to `base64` if they are too large, and contain carriage returns.
        </Message>
    </TabsTab>
    <TabsTab label="Private Networks">
    Configure the Private Network for the container to ensure secure and isolated network communication. Click **Select a Private Network** to:
        - Attach an existing Private Network (VPC) within the same Availability Zone from the drop-down menu.
        - Create a new Private Network and attach it to the container.
    </TabsTab>
    <TabsTab label="Security">
    - Set the desired [privacy policy](/serverless-containers/concepts/#privacy-policy) for your container. This defines whether container invocation may be done anonymously (**public**) or only via an authentication mechanism provided by the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-containers/#authentication) (**private**).
    - Tick the box under **HTTPS connections only** to prevent your container from being called from insecure HTTP connections. All HTTP traffic will be redirected to HTTPS.
    </TabsTab>
    <TabsTab label="Requests">
    - Set a custom [timeout](/serverless-containers/concepts/#request-timeout) for the duration of the requests received by your container.
    - Tick the box under [HTTP protocol](/serverless-containers/concepts/#protocol) to listen to HTTP/2 requests if it is required by your application. Otherwise, we recommend you use HTTP/1.
    </TabsTab>
    <TabsTab label="Performances">
    - Select a [sandbox](/serverless-containers/concepts/#sandbox) version:
        - Sandbox v2 for shorter cold starts (recommended).
        - Sandbox v1 if you require full compatibility with the Linux system call interface (legacy).
    </TabsTab>
    <TabsTab label="Health checks">
    - Update the [health check](/serverless-containers/concepts/#health-check) behavior according to your needs:
        - **Probe type**: TCP or HTTP
        - **Health checks intervals**: 5s - 120s (default: 30s)
        - **Failure threshold**: 3 - 50 (default: 10)
    </TabsTab>
    <TabsTab label="Storage">
    - Modify the [ephemeral storage](/serverless-containers/concepts/#ephemeral-storage) according to your needs.
    </TabsTab>
</Tabs>
