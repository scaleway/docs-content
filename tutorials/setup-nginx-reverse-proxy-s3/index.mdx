## Object Storage Proxy Overview

The [Scaleway Object Storage](/storage/object/) lets you store unlimited data in buckets. You can either access the data directly via your bucket. This consumes data transfer and will be deducted from your monthly package allowance, or be billed when you exceed your included data transfer.
It is possible to access your bucket via a compute instance as a proxy. Transfer of data between your bucket and the compute platform is free of charge, and you can use the bandwidth included with your instance to distribute the files in your bucket. We will use the [Nginx](http://nginx.org/) reverse proxy to provide read-only access to the bucket's contents.

The request to retrieve a bucket is forwarded to the Object Storage bucket by Nginx when the client sends an HTTP request to the Nginx proxy server. The Object Storage platform replies in delivering the requested object to Nginx, which forwards it to the client requesting the object.

To reduce the load on the bucket and to speed up the delivery of frequently requested objects, it is possible to cache them locally in Ngin

In this case, an object will be stored temporarily in the cache of Nginx. The client requests an object, and it will be delivered to the client directly from Nginx without forwarding the request to the Object Storage platform.

## Installing Nginx

1. Log into your Virtual Instance using SSH:
  ```
  ssh root@<your_instance_ip>
  ```

2. Make sure the `apt` repositories as well as the software already installed on the compute instance is up to date:
  ```
  apt update && apt upgrade -y
  ```

3. Install `nginx` using the `apt` package manager:
  ```
  apt install nginx -y
  ```

## Configuring Nginx

1. Open the Nginx configuration file in a text editor:
    ```
    nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    ```

2. Edit the file as follows:

  Remember to replace `s3proxy.mydomain.eu` with the domain name of your compute instance and `myobjectstoragebucket.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud` with the URL of your Object Storage bucket.

          }

        }
      }

  Save the file and exit `nano` once it is edited.

3. Make sure that there are no typos in the Nginx configuration file by syntax checking it using the following command:
  ```
  nginx -t
  ```

4. Restart Nginx to apply the new configuration:
  ```
  service nginx restart
  ```

You can now access the files of your bucket either directly by going to for example `http://s3proxy.mydomain.eu/s3/myfile.txt` or access a cached version after the first retrieval by going to `http://s3proxy.mydomain.eu/s3_cached/myfile.txt`

## Configuring HTTPS

Connections to your S3 proxy are currently available in plain, unencrypted HTTP only. It is possible to encrypt the connection between the client and the Nginx proxy by configuring HTTPS. To do so, we will obtain a free SSL certificate issued by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) using [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/), a tool to obtain, manage and renew Let's Encrypt certificates automatically.

1. Certbot is in active development and it is possible, that the packages included in Ubuntu are already Outdated. Therefore add the Certbot repository to apt to download the latest release of the software:
  ```
  add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
  ```
  Press `Enter` when asked to confirm the action.

2. Install Certbot for Nginx:
  ```
  apt install python-certbot-nginx -y
  ```

3. Launch the certificate generation:
  ```
  certbot --nginx -d
  ```
  When running Certbot for the first time, you will be asked to enter your email address. Confirm it by pressing `Enter√π on your keyboard.

4. Once confirmed Certbot will run a challenge and request the certificate. When asked to redirect all traffic to HTTPS, press `2`, then `Enter` on your keyboard:
    ```
    Please choose whether or not to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS, removing HTTP access.
    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    1: No redirect - Make no further changes to the webserver configuration.
    2: Redirect - Make all requests redirect to secure HTTPS access. Choose this for
    new sites, or if you're confident your site works on HTTPS. You can undo this
    change by editing your web server's configuration.
    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    Select the appropriate number [1-2] then [enter] (press 'c' to cancel):
    ```

    Certbot will now reconfigure Nginx and once you see the following message your certificate is successfully installed:

    ```
    IMPORTANT NOTES:
    - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
      /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem
      Your key file has been saved at:
      /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem
      Your cert will expire on 2019-04-15. To obtain a new or tweaked
      version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot again
      with the "certonly" option. To non-interactively renew *all* of
      your certificates, run "certbot renew"
    - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
      configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
      secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
      also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
      making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
    - If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:

      Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt:   https://letsencrypt.org/donate
      Donating to EFF:                    https://eff.org/donate-le

    ```

You have now securized the connection between the client and your Nginx proxy using TLS. You can verify it by opening a web browser and going to for example `https://s3proxy.mydomain.eu/s3/myfile.txt`. The file will be downloaded using an encrypted connection.
