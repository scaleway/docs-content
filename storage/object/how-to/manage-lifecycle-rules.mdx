With the Scaleway console, you can use lifecycle rules to [manually](/storage/object/how-to/edit-storage-class/) or automatically change the storage class of your objects. These rules also allow users to set expiration dates for objects and their versions.

Lifecycle rules also allow you to automatically abort incomplete [multipart uploads](/storage/object/api-cli/multipart-uploads/).

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)

## How to create a lifecycle rule
1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the name of your bucket. The list of your objects displays.
3. Click **Lifecycle rules**.
4. Click **+ Create Lifecycle rule** to add a rule.
5. Enter a name for the rule.
6. Select the scope of the lifecycle rule:
    - Apply the rule to all the objects contained in the bucket.
    - Filter the objects you want the rule to be applied to by one or both of the following criteria:
        - [**Prefix**](/storage/object/concepts/#prefix): based on the object name and path. The defined rule will be applied to all objects with the same name [prefix](/storage/object/concepts/#prefix).
        - [**Tags**](/storage/object/concepts/#tags): comprised of a **key** and an associated **value**. These tags should be defined before rule creation, for either a bucket or an object. You can add one or more tags to your filter.
7. Configure the behavior of the lifecycle rule:
    - Automatically transition the current version of your objects to another storage class after a specified number of days. 
    - Automatically delete the current version of your objects after a specified number of days.
    - Automatically abort [incomplete multipart uploads](/storage/object/api-cli/multipart-uploads/#aborting-a-multipart-upload) after a specified number of days.

8. Click **Next Step** to proceed.

9. Review the summary of your lifecycle rule, then click **Create lifecycle rule** to confirm.

<Message type="important">
  - Lifecycle rules are limited to 500,000 jobs per day. Beyond this limit, you can [transition](/storage/object/how-to/edit-storage-class/) or [delete](/storage/object/how-to/delete-an-object/) your objects manually. 

  - Lifecycle rules only allow the following transitions:
    - Standard -> Onezone IA
    - Standard -> Glacier
    - Onezone IA -> Glacier
