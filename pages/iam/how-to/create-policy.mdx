An IAM [policy](/iam/reference-content/policy/) is used to define the permissions of users, groups, and applications in a given [Organization](/iam/concepts/#organization). A policy is composed of a **principal** (the user, group, or application to which it applies) and one or more **IAM rules** (which describe the permission sets the principal should have, and the scope of those permission sets).

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

1. Click **IAM & API keys** on the top-right drop-down menu of the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) displays.

2. Click the **Policies** tab. A list of the Organization's existing policies displays:
    <Lightbox image={image3} alt="" />
3. Click **Create policy**. The creation wizard displays:
    <Lightbox image={image4} alt="" />
4. Complete the steps on the first page of the creation wizard:
    - Enter a **name** for the policy,
    - Add a tag (optional),
    <Message type="note">
      Tags are key/value pairs that help you organize your users. Keep in mind that:
      - You can assign up to 10 tags per user
      - Tag values must be between 1 and 70 characters long, including `key` and `value`
      - The same tag cannot be used twice
    </Message>
    - Enter a **description** (optional),
    - Select a **principal**, who will be the target of your policy. The [principal](/iam/concepts/#principal) should be the user, application, or group who you want to grant specific permissions to through this policy.
    <Message type="important">
      You can choose to create a policy without a principal for now, and attach the principal later. Be aware that the policy will have no effect until a principal is attached. A policy can only be attached to one principal at a time.
    </Message>
5. Click **Add rules** to progress to the next part of the policy creation wizard.

    <Message type="tip">
      Rules define the actions that the attached principal will be able to carry out within the Organization. When creating a rule, you first set the **scope** of the rule, and then select the **permission sets** to apply within the scope. You can optionally set up **conditions** for your rule. See our dedicated documentation for more help with [policies, rules, scopes and permission sets](/iam/reference-content/policy/).
    </Message>
6. Select a **scope** for the rule:
    - To give the principal permissions to view, create, edit and/or delete [resources](/iam/concepts/#resource), select the **Access to resources** scope. Then, select the [Project](/iam/concepts/#project) in which you want the permissions to apply. You can select from **all current and future Projects**, **all current Projects** or select specific Projects.
    - To give the principal permissions to [Organization](/iam/concepts/#organization)-level features such as IAM, billing, support & abuse tickets and project management, select the **Access to Organization features** scope.
7. Click **Validate** to continue.
8. Choose the **permission sets** for the rule by selecting the required boxes. You can select as many permission sets as you like. The principal will have the rights defined in these permission sets within the scope you set in **step 6**. See our dedicated documentation for [more help with permission sets](/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/).
9. Click **Validate**.
10. (Optional) Click **+ Add new** to add one or more conditions. You can allow access to specific user agents or IP addresses, and allow actions to be performed only at certain dates and times.
    <Message type="tip">
      Refer to the [Understanding policy conditions](/iam/reference-content/understanding-policy-conditions) documentation page for more details about how to write condition expressions, as well as examples of conditions.
    </Message>
11. Click **Validate**. The rule, with its scope and permission sets, is added to the list of the policy's rules.
12. Click **Add new rule** and repeat steps 6 to 8 as many times as required to add multiple rules to your policy.
    <Message type="tip">
      You can delete <Icon name="delete" /> or edit <Icon name="edit" /> an existing rule by clicking the relevant button in the top right corner of the rule's summary.
    </Message>
13. Click **Create policy** to finish.

    You are returned to the **Policies** tab, where the newly-created policy now appears in the list.

      The application of Object Storage permissions can take up to 5 minutes.
