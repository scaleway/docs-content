Both the [Chat Completions API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/generative-apis/#path-chat-completions-create-a-chat-completion) and the [Responses API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/generative-apis/#path-responses-beta-create-a-response) are OpenAI-compatible REST APIs that can be used for generating and manipulating conversations. The Chat Completions API is focused on generating conversational responses, while the Responses API is a more general REST API for chat, structured outputs, tool use, and multimodal inputs.

The **Chat Completions** API was released in 2023, and is an industry standard for building AI applications, being specifically designed for handling multi-turn conversations. It is stateless, but allows users to manage conversation history by appending each new message to the ongoing conversation. Messages in the conversation can include text, images and audio extracts. The API also supports `function` tool-calling, where the developer defines a set of functions, which the model can decide whether to call when generating a response. If it decides to call one of these functions, it returns the function name and arguments, and the developer's own code must actually execute the function and feed the result back into the conversation for use by the model.

The **Responses** API was released in 2025, and is designed to combine the simplicity of Chat Completions with the ability to do more agentic tasks and reasoning. It supports statefulness, being able to maintain context without needing to resend the entire conversation history. It offers tool-calling by built-in tools (e.g. web or file search) that the model is able to execute itself while generating a response, though currently only `function` tools are supported by Scaleway. Overall, **Scaleway's support for the Responses API is currently at beta stage and the support of the full features set will be incremental**. Most of the supported Generative API models can be used with Responses API, and note that for the **`gtp-oss-120b` model, the use of the Responses API is recommended** as it will allow you to access all of its features, especially tools calling.
