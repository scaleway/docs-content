import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'


<Requirements />
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/)

The action to take depends on whether DHCP is [activated](/vpc/reference-content/vpc-migration/) on your Private Network.

If it is not, disconnect the Instance from the Private Network, as there may be other factors impacting your Instance, like one of your Instances running a DHCP server.

If it is, this is expected behavior as all the traffic towards your Instance now goes through the Public Gateway. The recommended solution to connect to your Instance is to use [SSH bastion](/public-gateways/how-to/use-ssh-bastion/#how-to-connect-to-a-resource-behind-your-ssh-bastion).
