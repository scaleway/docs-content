Powering off your Instance shuts it down by transferring all the data on the Instance's local volume, to a volume store. The physical node is released back to the pool of available machines. The Instance's flexible IP (if it has one) remains available in your account.

  The power-off process may take some time, depending on the amount of data on the Instance's local volume. You should shut down the OS of your Instance first by logging into your Instance as root and executing the halt command.
