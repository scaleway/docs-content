Default Instance images for Ubuntu, Debian and CentOS support autoconfiguration of interfaces plugged into a Private Network.

They leverage helper scripts provided by the scaleway-ecosystem package. These scripts:

- enable DHCP on the interfaces plugged into a Private Network
- when Instances are attached to Private Networks plugged into Public Gateways, make the default route received by DHCP the primary route for all traffic on the Instance
- keep the route to the Scaleway Metadata API more specific (see below).

If your Instance does not get autoconfigured, it may be that you are using an old version of the scaleway-ecosystem package. `scaleway-ecosystem 0.0.4` or later is required. Use the following command to update it:

- On Ubuntu (Focal and Jammy) or Debian (Stretch and Buster):

    ```bash
    add-apt-repository ppa:scaleway/stable && apt update && apt install scaleway-ecosystem
    add-apt-repository ppa:scaleway/stable && apt update && apt install scaleway-ecosystem
    apt list scaleway-ecosystem
    ```

- On Debian distributions (Bookworm, Bullseye and Buster):

    ```bash
    cat << EOF > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/scaleway-ubuntu-debian-stable-jammy.list
    deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/scaleway/debian-stable/ubuntu jammy main
    # deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/scaleway/debian-stable/ubuntu jammy main
    EOF
    apt -y update
    apt install scaleway-ecosystem
    apt list scaleway-ecosystem
    ```

- On CentOS 7:

    ```bash
    yum -y install yum-plugin-copr
    yum -y copr enable @scaleway/instances
    yum -y install scaleway-ecosystem
    ```

- On Centos Stream 8 and later, RockyLinux, AlmaLinux or Fedora:

    ```bash
    dnf -y copr enable @scaleway/ecosystem
    dnf -y install scaleway-ecosystem
    ```

These scripts register a custom `SystemD` unit named `scw-vpc-iface` that seamlessly configures this instance's IPs for all the Private Networks it is a part of. Your own unit services may need to [depend on this unit.](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html#Wants=)
