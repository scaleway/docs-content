This page shows you how to display your email activity and filter your emails using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/).

With [flags](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#flags), you can also get more information on your emails' statuses.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)

- [Configured your domain(s) with Transactional Email](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/configure-domain-with-transactional-email)
- Added [SPF, DKIM](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/add-spf-dkim-records-to-your-domain), and [MX](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/add-mx-record-to-your-domain) records to your domain(s)

## How to display your email activity

1. Click **Transactional Email** in the **Managed Services** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. Your domains display.
2. Click the domain for which you want to track the email activity. You are redirected to the **Email activity** tab where a list of your emails displays.
3. Click <Icon name="seeMore" /> next to the email for which you want to get more detail. You are directed to a page with more details such as the status of your email, the flags that apply to your email, how many times Scaleway tried to send your email, and the email address from which the email was sent.

## How to use your domain's Email activity tab

 Your domainâ€™s **Email activity** tab allows you to filter your emails, and list your filtered emails. It also provides you with additional information about your emails.

- The **Filter by** bar allows you to target emails sent to specific recipients or by specific senders.

- The **Period** drop-down allows you to target a time frame during which you have sent emails:

    - Last hour: displays all emails sent during the last hour
    - Last 24 hours: displays all emails sent during the last 24 hours
    - Last week: display all emails sent during the last week
    - Last month: displays all emails sent during the last month
    - Last year: displays all emails sent during the last calendar year

- The **Email status** drop-down allows you to target specific emails according to their **status** or their **flags**.
