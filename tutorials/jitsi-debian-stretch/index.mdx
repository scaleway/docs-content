## Jitsi Meet Overview

[Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/) is a free and fully encrypted open source video conferencing service solution providing high quality and audio without subscription or the need to create an account.

The tool provides features like:
* Sharing of desktops, presentations, and more
* Inviting users to a conference via a simple, custom URL

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your SSH key](/console/project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
  - You have [created an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance) running Debian Stretch (9.0). For best performances of Jitsi Meet, an Instance with at least 4 GB RAM is recommended
  - You have a domain or subdomain pointed to your Instance
</Message>

## Installing Jitsi Meet

1. Configure a the hostname of the server corresponding to your domain / subdomain name:
    ```
    hostnamectl set-hostname jitsi
    sed -i 's/^127.0.1.1.*$/127.0.1.1 jitsi.mydomain.tld jitsi/g' /etc/hosts
    ```
2. Start by updating the software already installed on the system:
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```
3. Install Java 8 on the server:
    ```
    apt install -y openjdk-8-jre-headless
    ```
4. Setup the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable:
    ```
    echo "JAVA_HOME=$(readlink -f /usr/bin/java | sed "s:bin/java::")" | tee -a /etc/profile
    source /etc/profile
    ```
5. Install a [Nginx](https://nginx.org) web server before installing Jitsi Meet. The Jitsi installation tool will take care about the configuration of Nginx, if it is present on the system. Run the following commands to install and enable Nginx:
    ```
    apt install -y nginx
    systemctl start nginx.service
    systemctl enable nginx.service
    ```

    <Message type="important">
      If Nginx or Apache is not present on the system, Jitsi Meet will automatically install [Jetty](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) during the installation.

6. Download the APT key and setup the repositories of Jitsi, to install the software via `apt`:
    ```
    wget -qO - https://download.jitsi.org/jitsi-key.gpg.key | apt-key add -
    sh -c "echo 'deb https://download.jitsi.org stable/' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jitsi-stable.list"
    apt update -y
    ```
7. Launch the installation of Jitsi Meet:
    ```
    apt install -y jitsi-meet
    ```

  When asked, enter:

    - The FQDN of your Instance. For example `jitsi.mydomain.tld` and press Enter.
    - When asked about the SSL certificate choose the `Generate a new self-signed certificate (You will later get a chance to obtain a Let's Encrypt certificate)` option and press Enter.
8. Run the following script to generate a [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) SSL certificate for your Instance:
    ```
    /usr/share/jitsi-meet/scripts/install-letsencrypt-cert.sh
    ```

  When asked, enter:

    - Your e-mail address to receive notifications regarding your certificate and press enter to request the certificate.
9. The Jitsi Meet Instance is configured now and ready for a first conference call. Open a Web-browser and type the FQDN of your Instance, for example: `https://jitsi.mydomain.tld`. The following screen will appear:
