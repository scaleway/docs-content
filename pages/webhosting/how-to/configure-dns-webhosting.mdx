To link your domain name with Web Hosting, you must update the DNS configuration of your domain name to use Scaleway's configuration. Once updated, you can verify the configuration to activate your Web Hosting plan.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Registered a domain name](/domains-and-dns/how-to/register-internal-domain/) at Scaleway or another registrar
- A Web Hosting plan

1. Click **Web Hosting** in the **Domains & Web Hosting** section of the side menu.
2. Click the domain of the Web Hosting plan you wish to configure. The **Hosting information** page displays.
3. Click the **DNS verification** tab.
4. Update your DNS servers. You have two options:
    - **Scaleway DNS servers**:
        Scaleway provides DNS servers for your Web Hosting plan with the required DNS configuration. To use the Scaleway DNS servers, replace the nameservers associated with your domain with those provided by Scaleway.
        <Message type="note">
          DNS server updates can take 24 to 48 hours to propagate across the internet.
        </Message>
    - **Manual DNS configuration (advanced)**:
        If you prefer to continue using your current DNS servers, update the DNS zone at your registrar with all the DNS records provided by Scaleway.
        <Message type="tip">
          To use your Web Hosting plan without waiting for the DNS server propagation to be complete, manually configure the DNS zone records as follows:
          * A & AAAA records for the domain you intend to use (ensure to include both `domain.org` and `www.domain.org`, for example)
          * MX records for enabling webmail services
        </Message>
    <Message type="important">
      Your website and email mailbox will be unavailable during DNS server propagation. To avoid this downtime and minimize the delay before your website becomes accessible, use the manual configuration option described above.
    </Message>
5. After updating your DNS configuration, click **Verify domain**. This initiates the DNS verification process.

    Once the process is complete, a green check with the text **Configured** will display next to the nameservers and records to configure.
