[dhcpcd](https://roy.marples.name/projects/dhcpcd/) is an open-source DHCP client, supporting both IPv4, and IPv6. The feature-rich software can be used to configure and automate network-related parameters of your computer using the [DHCP protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol).

In this tutorial, you will learn how to configure your IPv6 subnet with DHCPCD on Debian 10 on a Scaleway Dedibox dedicated server. 

	
<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net)
  - You have a [Dedibox&reg; Dedicated Server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox) running on Debian 10. 
  - You have root access to the server

</Message>


## Installing DCHPCD

1. Change into the root account of your server by using `su` and the password of the `root` user.

2. Update the `apt` package manager repositories, then upgrade the software already installed on the machine to the latest version available in the repositories: 

  ```
  apt update && apt upgrade -y
  ```

3. Install DHCPCD using the `apt` package manager:

  ```
  apt install dhcpcd5
  ```

## Configuring DHCPCD


<Message type="note">

  We assume you have already generated a [IPv6 subnet and its associated DUID](https://documentation.online.net/en/dedicated-server/network/ipv6/prefix).

</Message> 

1. Configure your network interface. The configuration is located in a file named `/etc/network/interfaces`. Open the file in a text editor, e.g. `nano`, and edit it as follows:

  ```
  auto lo
  iface lo inet loopback

  auto eth0
  iface eth0
      use dhcp
      # An address in the IPv6 block provided by Scaleway Dedibox
      address <your_prefix>:<your_chosen_suffix>
      netmask 64
  ```

2. Open the DHCPCD configuration file located at `/etc/dhcpcd.conf` in a text editor of your choice and edit it as follows:

  ```
  # Inform the DHCP server of our hostname for DDNS.
  hostname

  # This parameter allows only selected interfaces to use the client
  allowinterfaces eth*

  # Use the same DUID + IAID as set in DHCPv6 for DHCPv4 ClientID as per RFC4361.
  duid

  # Persist interface configuration when dhcpcd exits.
  persistent

  # Rapid commit support.
  # Safe to enable by default because it requires the equivalent option set
  # on the server to actually work.
  option rapid_commit

  # A list of options to request from the DHCP server.
  option domain_name_servers, domain_name, domain_search, host_name
  option classless_static_routes
  # Respect the network MTU. This is applied to DHCP routes.
  option interface_mtu

  # A ServerID is required by RFC2131.
  require dhcp_server_identifier

  slaac hwaddr

  debug
  ```

3. Write the [DUID] of your subnet in the file `/var/lib/dhcpcd/duid` using a text editor of your choice, for example `nano`:

  ```
  nano /var/lib/dhcpcd/duid
  ```

4. Enable the DHCPCD service to be started automatically during system boot.

  ```
  systemctl enable dhcpcd.service
  ```

5. Start the service manually.

  ```
  systemctl start dhcpcd.service
  ```

6. Verify the status of the service.

  ```
  systemctl status dhcpcd.service
  ```

  You should see an output similar to the following example: 

  ```

Your server is now ready to communicate with IPv6. For more information about IPv6 at Scaleway Dedibox, refer to our [dedicated documentation](https://documentation.online.net/en/dedicated-server/network/ipv6/start).
