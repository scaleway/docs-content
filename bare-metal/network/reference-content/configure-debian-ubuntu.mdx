This page shows you how to configure a [failover IP](/bare-metal/dedibox/concepts/#failover-ips) on Dedibox servers running on Debian or Ubuntu Linux.

## Failover IP configuration on Debian

<Message type="note">
  If you are using Ubuntu 18.04 or later, you should configure the interfaces using [Netplan](/bare-metal/network/reference-content/configure-network-netplan/).
</Message>

1. Connect to your server using SSH. 
2. Open the network configuration file `/etc/network/interfaces` in a text editor, for example `nano`: 
    ```sh 
    nano /etc/network/interfaces
    ```
3. Add the failover IP to the configuration as shown in the following example:
    ```sh 
    # This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
    # and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5). 
    # The loopback network interface 
    auto lo 
    iface lo inet loopback 
    # The primary network interface 
    auto eth0 
    iface eth0 inet static 
        	 address 195.154.123.123
         	 netmask 255.255.255.0 
        	 gateway 195.154.123.1
    auto eth0:0
    iface eth0:0 inet static
    address ip_failover
    netmask 255.255.255.255
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      The interface name `eth0` may vary, depending on your OS version and system configuration. Use the `ifconfig` command to determine the name of your primary network interface.
    </Message>
4. Save the file and exit the editor. 
5. Bring up the interface using the following command:
    ```sh 
    ifup eth0:0
    ```

## Failover IP configuration on Ubuntu

Since the release of version 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) Ubuntu has switched to [Netplan](https://netplan.io/) for the configuration of network interfaces.

It is a [YAML-based](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) configuration system, which simplifies the configuration process.

1. Connect to your Dedibox using SSH. 
2. Open the Netplan configuration file of the main interface in a text editor, for example `nano`: 
    ```sh 
    sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
    ```
3. Edit the network configuration. The IP addresses have to be written with their [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation). The netmask is `/24` for the principal IP of the server and `/32` for each failover IP. Your configuration should look as in the following example: 
    ```yaml
    network:
    version: 2
    renderer: networkd
    ethernets:
        enp1s0f0:
        addresses: [163.172.123.123/24, 212.83.123.123/32]
        gateway4: 163.172.123.1
        nameservers:
            addresses: [ "62.210.16.6", "62.210.16.7" ]
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      Make sure to respect the YAML standards when you edit the file as it might not work if there is a syntax error in your configuration.
    </Message>
4. Activate the new configuration by running the following command:
    ```sh 
    sudo netplan apply
    ```
