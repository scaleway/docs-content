This page shows you how to configure a [failover IP](/dedibox-network/ip-failover/concepts/#failover-ips) on Dedibox servers running on Debian or Ubuntu Linux.

## Failover IP configuration on Debian

<Message type="note">
  If you are using Ubuntu 18.04 or later, you should configure the interfaces using [Netplan](/dedibox-network/network/how-to/configure-network-netplan/).
</Message>

1. Connect to your server using SSH.
2. Open the network configuration file `/etc/network/interfaces` in a text editor, for example `nano`:
    ```
    nano /etc/network/interfaces
    ```
3. Add the failover IP to the configuration as shown in the following example:
    ```
    # This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
    # and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).
    # The loopback network interface
    auto lo
    iface lo inet loopback
    # The primary network interface
    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet static
        	 address 195.154.123.123
         	 netmask 255.255.255.0
        	 gateway 195.154.123.1
    auto eth0:0
    iface eth0:0 inet static
    address ip_failover
    netmask 255.255.255.255
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      The interface name `eth0` may vary, depending on your OS version and system configuration. Use the `ifconfig` command to determine the name of your primary network interface.
    </Message>
4. Save the file and exit the editor.
5. Bring up the interface using the following command:
    ```
    ifup eth0:0
    ```

## Failover IP configuration on Ubuntu

Since the release of version 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) Ubuntu has switched to [Netplan](https://netplan.io/) for the configuration of network interfaces.

It is a YAML-based configuration system, which simplifies the configuration process.

1. Connect to your Dedibox using SSH.
2. Open the Netplan configuration file of the main interface in a text editor, for example `nano`:
    ```
    sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
    ```
3. Edit the network configuration. The IP addresses have to be written with their [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation/). The netmask is `/24` for the principal IP of the server and `/32` for each failover IP. Your configuration should look as in the following example:
    ```yaml
    network:
      renderer: networkd
      ethernets:
        ensXX:
          addresses:
            - <FAILOVER_IP>/32
          routes:
            - to: 62.210.0.1
            - to: default
              via: 62.210.0.1
          nameservers:
            addresses:
              - 51.159.47.28
              - 51.159.47.26 # Replace the IP of the DNS cache server with the one located in the same physical location as your machine for optimal performance (https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/console/account/reference-content/scaleway-network-information/#dns-cache-servers/)
            search: []
    version: 2
    ```
    <Message type="tip">
      * Make sure to respect the YAML standards when you edit the file, as it might not work if there is a syntax error in your configuration.
      * You can find an extended list of [netplan configuration examples](https://github.com/canonical/netplan/tree/main/examples/) in the official Canonical Netplan repository.
    </Message>
4. Activate the new configuration by running the following command:
    ```
    sudo netplan apply
    ```
