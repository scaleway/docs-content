## How to disable a member's MFA

If [Multifactor Authentication (MFA) is enabled](/account/how-to/use-2fa) for a member you can disable it anytime. Disabling MFA is useful if the member loses access to their authentication app and needs to reset MFA.

1. Click **IAM & API keys** on the top-right drop-down menu of the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) displays.
2. Click the name of the member you want to delete. Alternatively, click <Icon name="more" /> next to the member, and select **Overview**. Either way, you are taken to the user's **Overview** tab.
3. Click the **Credentials** tab.
4. Scroll to the **Disable multifactor authentication** section.
5. Click **Disable MFA**. A pop-up appears.
    <Message type="important">
      Keep in mind that disabling MFA means a member will no longer be required to sign in with MFA. If [MFA is enforced](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/enforce-mfa) at the Organization level, the member will have a grace period allowing them to enable it again.

6. Type **DISABLE** in the box and click **Confirm**.

## How to enforce MFA for a member

You can enforce MFA for all users in your Organization, including members.

## How to enforce password renewal

1. Go to the [Security](https://console.scaleway.com/settings/security) settings of your Organization.
2. Scroll to the **Password renewal** section.
3. Click **Enforce renewal**. A pop-up displays.
    <Message type="important">
      Enforcing password renewal means that all members with a password in the Organization will be requested to reset it upon their first login.
    </Message>
4. Type **ENFORCE** in the box and click **Confirm**.

## How to stop enforcing password renewal

1. Go to the [Security](https://console.scaleway.com/settings/security) settings of your Organization.
2. Scroll to the **Password renewal** section.
3. Click **Stop enforcing renewal**. A pop-up displays.
4. Type **STOP** in the box and click **Confirm**.

## How to edit the grace period of your Organization

From their first login, Members have a default grace period of 3 days to comply with security requirements before their access to the Organization is automatically locked. You can extend or reduce the grace period in the console.

<Message type="important">
  Locked Members cannot connect to the Organization until they are [manually unlocked](/iam/how-to/manage-members#how-to-unlock-a-member). Upon regaining access, the grace period resets, giving them another chance to meet security requirements.
</Message>

1. Go to the [Security](https://console.scaleway.com/settings/security) settings of your Organization.
2. Scroll to the **Grace period** section.
3. Click **Define grace period**. A pop-up displays.
4. Define the grace period in hours or days.
5. Click **Define grace period** to confirm.
