Virtual MAC addresses are virtual interface identifiers and are required for virtualization. If you run multiple virtual machines on one physical Elastic Metal server, you can configure the [MAC address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address) of its virtual network interface to the virtual MAC associated with the [flexible IP](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/concepts/#flexible-ip) to ensure network connectivity of the virtual machine.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your SSH key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key)
  - You have [created](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/create-server) and [installed](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/install-server) an Elastic Metal server
</Message>

<Message type="tip">
  Virtual MAC addresses are only required for virtualization purposes. If you want to configure the flexible IP as a second interface on the host OS, no virtual MAC is required.

1. Click **Elastic Metal** in the **Bare Metal** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Elastic Metal dashboard displays.
2. Click the **Flexible IPs** tab.
3. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the flexible IP you want to configure. The configuration menu of the flexible IP displays.
4. Click **More info** to see detailed information about the IP address.
5. Scroll down to the **Mac address** section and click **Add Mac address**:
6. Choose the desired type of virtual MAC address. You can choose from `VMware`, `XEN` or `KVM`. It is recommended to choose the type corresponding to your virtualization technology. Confirm by clicking on **Generate MAC Address**.

    If the virtual MAC address is no longer needed, you can remove it from the flexible IP by clicking on the **Delete** button.

For more information how to configure the flexible IP on a virtual machine, refer to our [documentation](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/configure-flexible-ip/)
