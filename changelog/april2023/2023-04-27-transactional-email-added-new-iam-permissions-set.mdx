We have integrated the following [IAM permissions,](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/) allowing separate management of emails and domains on Transactional Email:
- `TransactionalEmailDomainFullAccess` 
- `TransactionalEmailDomainReadyOnly` 
- `TransactionalEmailEmailFullAccess` 
- `TransactionalEmailEmailReadyOnly`
