Restricting IPs on Kubernetes Kapsule or Kosmos clusters enhances security by limiting access to only trusted sources, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential attacks.
This control ensures that only specific IP addresses or networks can interact with your clusters, providing an additional layer of protection.
The default entry `0.0.0.0/0` enables any host to establish a connection.

## How to add an IP address

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com). The Kubernetes Kapsule dashboard appears.
2. Select the cluster you wish to configure. The **Cluster information** page opens.
3. Click the **Allowed IPs** tab to view your current list.
4. Click **Add allowed IP**. Enter the IP address or IP block in CIDR format (e.g. `198.51.100.135/32` for a single IP, `198.51.100.0/24` for an IP block).
    <Message type="note">
      To restore default settings and allow connections from all IPs, add `0.0.0.0/0` to the list.

<Message type="important">
    For **Kosmos** multi-cloud clusters, allow connections from all Scaleway IP subnets to ensure proper functionality. Access from these IPs cannot be restricted. Refer to our [peering information](https://www.scaleway.com/en/peering/) for details on all Scaleway IP prefixes.
