Scaleway Domains and DNS provides a managed DNS solution by providing default nameservers for each domain name. If you want to use your own DNS servers, you can modify the nameservers associated with your domain name.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) 
- You have a domain name registered with Scaleway Domains and DNS

</Message>

1. Click **Domains and DNS** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. 

 The Domains and DNS dashboard displays. 
 
2. Click the domain name you want to configure.

3. Click **Edit** in the **Nameservers** section of the domain overview page. 

4. Edit the nameserver information. For each nameserver of your domain you can provide:
    * A fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
    * An IPv6 address
    * An IPv4 address

    <Message type="tip">

    IP addresses are only required if you want to create **glue records**. A glue record provides the IP address of a name server so that DNS can resolve the domain name if the domain uses nameservers hosted under that same domain name.

    </Message>

    We recommend you configure a minimum of two and a maximum of seven DNS servers for each domain name. To add additional servers, click **Add name server** and enter you server's information. 

5. Click <Icon name="delete" /> to remove a nameserver, then click **Delete** in the pop-up to confirm.

6. Click <Icon name="validate" /> to validate your configuration. To abandon the modifications click <Icon name="cancel" />.
