## Problem

My database is unavailable or in an error state.

## Cause

Several factors can put Serverless SQL Databases in an error state:

- Scheduled maintenance operations led by Scaleway
- Incident on the Scaleway infrastructure
- Incident on the Scaleway network

## Possible solutions

1. Using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/), check the status of your Serverless SQL Database from its **Overview** tab to make sure it is in an error state. If it is **Ready to use**, or **Running**, make sure that your [database connection is properly set](/serverless-sql-databases/how-to/connect-to-a-database/).

2. Refer to the [documentation on planned maintenance](/serverless-sql-databases/reference-content/planned-maintenance/) to check if you are currently in a maintenance period.

3. Go to the [Scaleway Status](https://status.scaleway.com/) website to check if an incident is currently ongoing.

4. Wait a few minutes, then check the status of your Serverless SQL Database using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) again.
