A Bare Metal server can be shut down from the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com). This powers off the physical server.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)  
- You have [configured your SSH Key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key)
- You have [created](/compute/bare-metal-cloud/how-to/create-server) and [installed](/compute/bare-metal-cloud/how-to/install-server) a Bare Metal server

</Message>

1. Click **Bare Metal** in the **Compute** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Bare Metal dashboard displays.

2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the server you want to shut down. A drop-down menu displays.

3. Click **Power off** in the menu.

4. Confirm that you have shut down the operating system and click **Power off this Bare Metal** to power off the server.

<Message type="important">

  Make sure to stop your operating system by executing the `halt` command,
  before shutting off the server. Otherwise you risk damaing the file system
  and causing data loss.
