NVIDIA NeMo (Neural Modules) is a conversational AI toolkit built by NVIDIA. The toolkit is designed to simplify the process of creating conversational AI models, including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) models.

NeMo is built on PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, and offers a high-level, modular API for building complex conversational AI models using pre-designed "neural modules."

## NeMo features and advantages

* **Modular and reusable:** The modular architecture allows developers to build, share, and reuse components easily, which can speed up the development process.
* **Flexible and scalable:** The tool supports multi-GPU and multi-node training, which enables the training of large models on large datasets.
* **End-to-end workflow:** From data processing to model training, optimization, and deployment, NeMo supports the entire conversational AI development workflow.
* **Diverse models:** NeMo includes a wide range of pre-trained models for various tasks like ASR, NLP, and TTS, which can be fine-tuned or used as they are.

## NeMo components

NeMo is built using the following components:

* **NeMo core:**
   - Offers foundational elements like the Neural Module Factory which helps in training and inferencing.

* **NeMo collections:**
   - It consists of different modules and models for ASR, NLP, and TTS.
   - Provides pre-trained models and training scripts that users can leverage for various tasks.

* **Neural Modules (NMs):**
   - These are the building blocks of NeMo.
   - They define trainable components such as encoders, decoders, and other neural network layers.
   - NMs can be interconnected to construct full models.

* **Application Scripts:**
   - NeMo provides ready-to-use scripts that allow users to quickly train models on their datasets or fine-tune pre-trained models.

## NeMo use cases

NVIDIA NeMo can be used for various applications such as:
   - Developing voice assistants.
   - Creating transcription services.
   - Building chat bots.
   - Developing natural language understanding models for various applications.

Developers, researchers, and companies interested in developing conversational AI models can benefit from NVIDIA NeMo to speed up the development process and create high-quality models.
