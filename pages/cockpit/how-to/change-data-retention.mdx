This page shows you how to change the [retention](/cockpit/concepts/#retention) period for your data sources. Extending your retention above default value is priced based on the volume of data effectively stored. Refer to the [Cockpit FAQ](/cockpit/faq/) for detailed information on pricing.

         - Reducing the retention period of a data source will permanently delete all observability data in that data source beyond the selected timeframe. This deletion is irreversible and takes effect a few minutes after the retention period is reduced, even if the retention period is later increased.
