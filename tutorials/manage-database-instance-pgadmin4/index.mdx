## pgAdmin Overview

[pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) is an open-source management tool for PostgreSQL databases. It allows the management of your [Scaleway Database Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/database/) and other PostgreSQL databases through an easy-to-use web-interface within your web browser.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your SSH Key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
  - You have a [Database for PostgreSQL](https://www.scaleway.com/en/database/)
  - You have [created an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance) that runs Debian Buster
  - You have sudo privileges or access to the root user
</Message>


## Installing pgAdmin

1. [Connect to your instance](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/) via SSH.
2. Update the `apt` sources and the software already installed on the instance:
  
  ```
  apt update && apt upgrade -y
  ```
3. Import the PostgreSQL [repository key](https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc):
    ```
    sudo apt-get install curl ca-certificates gnupg
    sudo curl https://www.pgadmin.org/static/packages_pgadmin_org.pub | sudo apt-key add
    ```
4. Add the PostgreSQL repository to the APT package manager, by configuring the file `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list`:
    ```
    sudo sh -c 'echo "deb https://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/pgadmin/pgadmin4/apt/$(lsb_release -cs) pgadmin4 main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgadmin4.list && apt update'
    ```
5. Update the `apt` sources and install pgAdmin 4 via the `apt` packet-manager. The following command will install the packages `pgadmin4` and `pgadmin4-apache2` providing an Apache web server configured for pgAdmin:
    ```
    apt-get update && apt-get install pgadmin4 pgadmin4-web -y
    ```
6. Configure the webserver, if you installed pgadmin4-web:
    ```
    sudo /usr/pgadmin4/bin/setup-web.sh
    ```
7. During the installation, you are prompted to enter the email address of the first user for pgAdmin. Enter your email address and press **Enter**:  ```
8. The installation tool asks for a password for the pgAdmin user. Enter it and press **Enter**:
9. Confirm the installation of pgadmin by pressing `y` when prompted. The basic installation of pgAdmin is complete now.

### Securing the connection using TLS 

By default, connections to the application are being made using an insecure HTTP connection. It is recommended to configure a HTTPS connection to encrypt the traffic between your instance and your computer. To do so, you should setup an **A-Record** within your domain name and install [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) to obtain a free Let's Encrypt TSL/SSL certificate:

1. Install Certbot and the Apache web server plugin:
    ```
    sudo apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-apache
    ```
2. Run Certbot to obtain a certificate and configure the Apache web server automatically:
    ```
    sudo certbot --apache
    ```

## Configuring pgAdmin

Once installed, proceed to the configuration of pgAdmin with your Scaleway Database Instance.

1. Open your web browser and point it to `http://<your_instance_ip>/pgadmin4/`, or if installed with HTTPS `https://<your_domain_name>/pgadmin4/`. The pgAdmin login page displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-pgadmin_login.webp" alt="" />
2. Enter the username and password configured during the installation and click **Login**
3. The pgAdmin dashboard displays, to connect the application with your Scaleway Database Instance, click **Add New Server**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-pgadmin_dashboard.webp" alt="" />
4. Specify the general information of the Database Instance:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-pgadmin_create_general.webp" alt="" />

    * **Name:** Enter a name of your choice for the Database Instance  
    * **Server group:** If you are managing multiple Database Instances, you can create server groups to make the management easier.
    * **Background:** You can configure a background color for the instance  
    * **Foreground:** You can set a foreground color for the instance  
    * **Connect now:** Tick this box to connect to the instance once the configuration is completed  
    * **Comments:** You may add additional comments to the instance
5. Click the **Connection** tab of the create server window and enter the connection details of your Database Instance:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-pgadmin_create_connection.webp" alt="" />

   * **Host name/address**: Enter the IP address of your Database Instance, displayed on the database information page of your instance.  
   * **Port:** Enter the port of your Database Instance. This information is available from the database information page of your instance.  
   * **Maintenance database:** Enter the information of your default database here. With default configuration this value shall be `rdb`.  
   * **Username**: Enter the username for your database. You can find this information in the users tab of your Database Instance in the Scaleway console.  
   * **Save Password:** Tick this box to save your database password in pgAdmin
6. Click the **SSL** panel and upload the SSL certificate available from the database information page of your [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com/rdb/). By default pgAdmin will negociate a SSL connection without checking the CA (this is the postgresql behaviour).

    With this option, we add a layer of security by checking the certificate authority (CA) used to sign the certificate and make sure this is the same as the one on the server.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-pgadmin_create_ssl.webp" alt="" />

    * **SSL mode:** Set the SSL mode value to `Verify-CA` to use the certificate issued by Scaleway  
    * **Client certificate:** Keep this value empty  
    * **Client certificate key:** Keep this value empty  
    * **Root certificate:** Click `...` to upload the SSL certificate available from your Scaleway console.
7. Once all settings are made, click **Save** to update the configuration of pgAdmin and to establish a connection to your Database Instance.
8. The Dashboard displays and your Database Instance is listed in the servers section of pgAdmin:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-pgadmin_dashboard_connected.webp" alt="" />

## Conclusion

You can now manage your Database Instance from a visual interface. For more information using pgAdmin, you may follow the [official documentation](https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/development/release_notes_4_16.html).
