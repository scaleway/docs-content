[Placement groups](/compute/instances/concepts/#placement-groups) allow you to define if you want certain Instances to run on different physical hypervisors for maximum availability or as physically close together as possible for minimum latency.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/)

## How to create a placement group

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The [Instances page](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers/) displays.
2. Click the **Placement groups** tab.
3. Click **Create placement group**. The creation wizard displays.
4. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 
    - Enter a **name** for your placement group, or leave the randomly-generated name in place. 
    - Choose an **Availability Zone**, which is the geographical region where your placement group will be created. You can only add Instances from this same Availability Zone to the placement group.
    - Choose the **type** of placement group:
      - **Low Latency** groups ensure that Instances are located as close as possible to each other
      - **Maximum Availability** groups ensure that Instances do not run on the same physical hypervisor 
    - Choose the **policy** for your placement group:
      - **Enforced**: if the group cannot be applied, only Instances on hypervisors matching the group settings will boot.
      - **Optional**: ensures the application of the placement group's settings wherever possible, but lets Instances boot on hypervisors that do not match the group policy.
    - Add **Instances** to the placement group.
