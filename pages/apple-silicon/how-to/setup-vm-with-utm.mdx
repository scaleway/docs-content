This guide explains the process to create a fully independent and functional virtual machine inside a Scaleway Mac using UTM, a powerful virtualization tool for macOS.
UTM is a free and open-source software that leverages Apple's Hypervisor framework and QEMU to provide virtualization capabilities.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- A [Mac mini](/apple-silicon/how-to/create-mac-mini/)
- [VNC access](/apple-silicon/how-to/access-remote-desktop-mac-mini/) to your Mac

## Installating UTM

1.  Download and install UTM on the Mac mini:
    *   From the official [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/utm-virtual-machines/id1538878817) or
    *   Directly from the [official website](https://getutm.app/).
2.  Download the macOS IPSW file.
    The IPSW file is a compressed file format used to install iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, HomePod, watchOS, and macOS firmware for devices equipped with Apple silicon.
    *   Obtain the macOS IPSW file from the official [Apple Developer website](https://developer.apple.com/download/).

3.  Create a new virtual machine:
    *   Open UTM and click the "+" button to create a new VM.
    *   Select "Virtualize" and then "macOS".
    *   Browse and select your downloaded IPSW file.
    *   Configure your VM's properties:
        *   Set your desired CPU cores (recommended at least 2 cores).
        *   Allocate RAM (recommended at least 4 GB).

        *   Configure the disk storage size (recommended at least 64 GB).

        *   Click "Save" to create the VM.

4.  Start and set up your macOS VM:
    *   Once the VM is installed with your properties, click the "Run" button in UTM.
    *   A GUI window will open displaying your VM.

    *   Follow the macOS installation process:
        *   Select language preferences.
        *   Set up your Apple ID (optional).
        *   Create a user account with a username and password.
        *   Choose time zone and other basic settings.
        *   Wait for the installation to complete.

## Troubleshooting
### You are experiencing IPSW compatibility issues
- Ensure your IPSW file is compatible with UTM by checking the following points:
    - The macOS version is supported by your UTM version
    - The IPSW architecture matches your Mac's architecture (in our case, `arm64` for Apple silicon architecture)
    - The IPSW file is not corrupted (verify checksums if available)
- For performance issues, try adjusting the allocated CPU cores and RAM

## Additional tips
- Take snapshots of your VM before making significant changes
- Use shared folders to easily transfer files between the host and guest systems
- For testing purposes, consider creating multiple VMs with different macOS versions
