Every Scaleway Dedibox account is associated with a specific email address. In the event that your email address undergoes any changes, you have the option to update this information directly within your account settings.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net)
</Message>

1. Click your username next to _logged in as:_ in the top right corner of the console. Then click **Account information** in the pop-up menu. The account information page displays.
2. Click **Update** next to your email address:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-dedibox-console-update-email.webp" width="800" alt="" />

    A link will be sent to the email address registered in the account.
3. Click the link sent to your registered email address, to access the email update form.
4. Enter your new email address and its confirmation. Then click **Update my mail** to submit.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-dedibox-console-confirm-new-email.webp" width="800" alt=""/>

You have now linked your new email address to your Scaleway Dedibox account.
