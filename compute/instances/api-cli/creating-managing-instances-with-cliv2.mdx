Scaleway's Instances provide you with resources to develop, test code and deploy your applications in no time. Instances are designed for modern workflows. They are with you from prototyping to large-scale deployment. You can create and manage your Instances from the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/login), via the API or via the Scaleway Command Line Interface.
