## Problem

My Go Serverless Function build failed with an error message about the wrong version.

## Cause

When deploying a Go function, build step can fail with an error about the version of code versus version of the runtime even if the version seems correct.

This is due to the `go.mod` directive that specify a `X.Y.Z` version where the `Z` version does not match.

This happens by default because in go toolchain, the `go mod init` command now adds the version.

## Possible solution

Remove the `Z` version from the gomod.

Wrong go.mod example:

```
go 1.24.1
```

Fixed:

```
go 1.24
````
