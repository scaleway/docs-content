After your Scaleway Dedibox server has been delivered, you can proceed with the installation process by following these steps.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- A [Dedibox server](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/order-a-server/)

1. In the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net/), navigate to **Server** > **Server list** in the top menu. A list of your servers will be displayed.
2. Click **Manage** next to the server you want to install. The server installation wizard will appear.
3. Select the operating system type to be installed.
   <Message type="tip">
     For detailed information about OS types, refer to the [dedicated servers concepts page](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/concepts/#os-type).
   </Message>

   <Message type="note">
     If you prefer to complete the installation using [KVM Over IP](/dedibox/kvm-over-ip/), click **Install over KVM** on this page.
   </Message>
4. Choose the specific operating system and version you wish to install, then click **Install**.
5. Customize the [partitioning](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/concepts/#partioning) configuration:

   - Select the **Filesystem**, **RAID level**, and specify the **mount point** and **partition size** in MB.
   - If the server has two disks, you can choose between **RAID 0**, **RAID 1**, or **No RAID**. For servers with more than two disks, **RAID 5** is also available. Configure the RAID and partitioning according to your needs. Ensure identical partitioning across all disks in a software RAID setup.

   **Partitioning restrictions:**
   - A maximum of 4 primary partitions per disk is allowed.
   - Do not create a `/var` partition, as it may cause installation failure.
   - The `/` partition must be at least 2048 MB.

   After configuring the partitions, click **Validate** to confirm and proceed.

6. Set a user and administrator password, and select SSH keys for server access. Once configured, click **Next Step**.
7. Review the configuration summary. If everything is correct, confirm by clicking **Delete all my disks and install the system**. This will initiate the automatic server installation.

   <Message type="important">
     - **This will delete all existing data on the disks.** Ensure you have backups before proceeding to avoid data loss.
     - If installing CentOS with custom partitioning, reserve approximately 5 GB of unallocated disk space to prevent installation errors.
   </Message>
8. Configure the system parameters, such as server name, username, password, SSH key, monitoring alerts, and updates.
   <Message type="note">
     To connect via SSH, we recommend [creating and uploading your SSH key](/dedibox-console/account/how-to/upload-an-ssh-key/) at this stage for transfer during installation.
   </Message>
9. Verify all details on the installation summary tab. Once installation is complete, your server will automatically reboot from its hard disk.

<Message type="note">
  - Installation time may vary depending on the OS; expect it to take several minutes.
  - Some operating systems may require additional reboots to complete the setup.
  - We recommend waiting 45 to 60 minutes before attempting to connect to your server.
