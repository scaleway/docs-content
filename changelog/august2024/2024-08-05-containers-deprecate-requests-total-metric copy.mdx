Following the introduction of the `serverless_functions_requests_per_second` metric, we are deprecating the `serverless_functions_requests_total` metric for use in custom dashboards and alerts.
We recommend that you update your custom dashboards and alerts to use the new `serverless_functions_requests_per_second` metric instead. The removal will be effective on September 19, 2024.
