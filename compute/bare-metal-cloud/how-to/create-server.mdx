3. Complete the following steps of the wizard:

      - Choose an **Availability Zone** in which your Bare Metal server will be deployed.
      - Choose an **image** to run on your server. If you don’t know yet which image you want to run on the Bare Metal server, you can order the server without a preinstalled image.

      - Enter a **name** for the server, and optionally add a description and tags to help you organize your Bare Metal servers.
