Elastic Metal servers support the installation of virtualization solutions Proxmox and ESXi. These solutions can be managed from either a web interface or a management tool and therefore direct SSH access to machines running one of these solutions is disabled by default. However, you can enable SSH for avanced management tasks if required.

<Message type="important">
  Enabling full SSH access to Proxmox or ESXi may cause security vulnerabilities on your installation. Be careful, and take extra precaution when you enable SSH.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) 
  - You have [created](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/create-server) and [installed](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/install-server) an Elastic Metal server with Proxmox VE
</Message>

## Enabling SSH on Proxmox VE

Proxmox VE is a complete, open-source server management platform for virtualization. It combines the KVM hypervisor and Linux Containers (LXC), storage and networking features - manageable through a web-based user interface. However, SSH connections to the Proxmox VE host are disabled by default for security reasons.

If you require SSH access to your Elastic Metal server, you can enable SSH on your machine after the installation of Proxmox from the Scaleway console.

1. Log in to the Proxmox web interface of your Elastic Metal server.
    <Message type="tip">
        You can find the URL of the Proxmox VE interface on the overview page of your Elastic Metal server in the Scaleway console.
    </Message>
2. Select your server in the Datacenter view of Proxmox.
3. Click **Shell** in the server view to open a shell in the web interface.
4. Open the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` in a text editor.
5. Go to the line `#PermitRootLogin` and uncomment it by removing the `#`. Change the option to yes:
    ```
    [...]
    PermitRootLogin yes
    [...]
    ```
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-proxmox-permit-ssh.webp" alt="" />
6. Save the file and quit the text editor.
7. Restart the SSH service to enable SSH login.
    ```
    systemctl restart ssh
    ```
    You can now use SSH on your Elastic Metal server. Use the login `root` and your Proxmox password when connecting to the machine.

## Enabling SSH on ESXi

VMware ESXi is a bare metal hypervisor that allows you to install multiple virtual machines on your Elastic Metal server. It can be configured from an easy-to-use web interface.

1. Log in to the ESXi web interface of your Elastic Metal server.
    <Message type="tip">
        You can find the URL of the ESXi interface on the overview page of your Elastic Metal server in the Scaleway console.
    </Message>
2. From the **Host** dashboard, click **Actions** > **Services** > **Enable Secure Shell (SSH)**. SSH is enabled.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_enable_ssh_esxi.webp" alt="" />
3. Log into your server using SSH.

    ```
    ssh root@my-exsi-host
    ```
    The ESXi shell displays. You can now perform administrative tasks on the machine.
    ```
    The time and date of this login have been sent to the system logs.

    WARNING:
      All commands run on the ESXi shell are logged and may be included in
      support bundles. Do not provide passwords directly on the command line.
      Most tools can prompt for secrets or accept them from standard input.

    VMware offers supported, powerful system administration tools.  Please
    see www.vmware.com/go/sysadmintools for details.

    The ESXi Shell can be disabled by an administrative user. See the
    vSphere Security documentation for more information.
    [root@my-esxi-host:~]
    ```
4. Disable SSH from the host dashboard. Click **Actions** > **Services** > **Disable Secure Shell (SSH)**. SSH is disabled.
  <Message type="tip">
    It is recommended to disable SSH access when not in use, to avoid potential security vulnerabilities related to the access.
