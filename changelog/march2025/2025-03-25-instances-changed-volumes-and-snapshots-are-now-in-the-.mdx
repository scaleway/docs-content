We have reorganized the Scaleway console to make Instance storage management more intuitive. Volumes and snapshots now have dedicated sections under [Block Storage](https://console.scaleway.com/block-storage/) and [Local Storage](https://console.scaleway.com/local-storage/) in the side menu.  

For more details, check out our documentation for [Block Storage](/block-storage/) and [Local Storage](/local-storage/).
