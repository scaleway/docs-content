Waypoint is an open-source tool developed by HashiCorp that focuses on simplifying the deployment and release workflows for applications.

The main goal of Waypoint is to abstract away the complexities of different deployment targets and provide a consistent interface for developers and operators.
It allows developers to deploy, manage, and observe their applications using a simple and declarative configuration file.
The tool works with Nomad, Kubernetes, ECS, and many other platforms.

## Waypoint plugins for Scaleway

We provide plugins for Waypoint, that add support for Scaleway.
Currently, the only plugin available is `container`.

## Plugin installation

### From releases

1. [Download the zip](https://github.com/scaleway/waypoint-plugin-scaleway/releases/) of the latest version for your architecture.
2. Unzip the plugin by running the following command: `unzip waypoint-plugin-scaleway-container_*.zip -d ~/.config/.waypoint/plugins/`.

      On macOS, you will have to execute the following command to ignore Apple's developer authenticity verification:
      ```
      xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/.config/.waypoint/plugins/waypoint-plugin-scaleway-container
      ```
    </Message>

### From sources

1. Clone the [Waypoint plugin repository](https://github.com/scaleway/waypoint-plugin-scaleway/) on your local machine.
2. Run the following command to build and install the plugin: 
    ```
    make all install
    ```

## Plugin usage

Add the following block to your Waypoint configuration to use the Scaleway plugin.

```
deploy {
  use "scaleway-container" {
    port = 80
    namespace_id = "<YOUR_SCALEWAY_NAMESPACE_ID>"
    region = "fr-par"
  }
}
```

<Message type="note">
  API keys are loaded from [Scaleway's config](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-sdk-go/tree/master/scw#scaleway-config/) default profile and can be overwritten by environment variables.
</Message>

A list of all options can be found in [container plugin documentation](https://github.com/scaleway/waypoint-plugin-scaleway/blob/master/docs/container.md/).

### Usage example

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- Installed [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- Installed [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads/)
- Installed [Waypoint](https://developer.hashicorp.com/waypoint/downloads/)
- Installed [`jq`](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/)
- Installed the Waypoint plugin for Scaleway

1. Clone the Waypoint plugin for Scaleway [demo repository](https://github.com/Codelax/waypoint-scaleway-demo/) and enter the repository folder.
2. Log into the Scaleway registry. If you are already logged in, you can skip this step.
    ```
    docker login rg.fr-par.scw.cloud -u nologin -p ${SCW_SECRET_KEY}
    ```
3. Initialize a new Terraform project.
    ```
    terraform init
    ```
4. Create a Kubernetes cluster and container namespace.
    ```
    terraform apply
    ```
5. Run the setup script to install a Waypoint server and automatically complete the `waypoint.hcl` configuration file with your container namespace information.
    ```
    ./setup.sh
    ```
6. Run the following command to connect to the Waypoint user interface.
    ```
    waypoint ui -authenticate
    ```
    <Message type="tip">
      If you run the application on a server, open the web UI address returned by the setup script and authenticate manually.
    </Message>
7. Initialize a new Waypoint project.
    ```
    waypoint init
    ```
8. Build and deploy your application on Scaleway's Serverless containers.
    ```
    waypoint up
    ```
