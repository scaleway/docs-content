You can upgrade your Database Instances in two ways: by increasing its Block Storage volume or by changing the node type.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [PostgreSQL or MySQL Database Instance](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/quickstart)

## How to increase a Block Storage volume

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the name of the Database Instance you want to configure. Your database's Overview page displays.
3. Scroll down to **Volume settings**.
4. Specify your volume capacity (in GB). The amount you define will be your new volume capacity.
    <Message type="important">
      - You can increase your Block Storage volume to up to 10 TB.
      - Block volume sizes cannot be decreased.
    </Message>
5. Click **Increase volume size** to confirm.

## How to change the node type

<Message type="important">
  If you have a Database Instance that uses a local volume, and you want to upgrade to a node type that uses Block volumes, you must [change the volume type](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/change-volume-type) to Block storage first. <br /><br />

  Similarly, if you have a new-generation Database Instance using a [Low Latency Block volume](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/concepts/#block-storage-low-latency) node type and want to switch to a first-generation node type, you must first change the volume type to [Basic Block Storage](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/concepts/#basic-block-storage).
</Message>

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the name of the Database Instance you want to configure. Your database's Overview page displays.
3. Scroll down to the **Node settings** section. Then, click **Change node type**.
4. Choose the specifications of the new Database Instance from the drop-down list.
5. Click **Update node type** to confirm your choices.
    <Message type="important">
      Make sure that the Database Instance you choose provides sufficient disk space for your database. Otherwise, an error message will be displayed, and the database will not be upgraded.
    </Message>

The action of changing the node type will perform a rolling upgrade of your Database Instance. During this process, the Database Instance will be unavailable for several tens of seconds.
