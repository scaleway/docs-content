## How to change a user's password

1. Click **OpenSearch** in the **Databases** section of the console. The Cloud Essentials for OpenSearch dashboard displays.

2. Click the name of the OpenSearch deployment in which you want to update a user's password. Its **Overview** page displays.

3. Click the **Users** tab. The list of users within your deployment displays.

4. Click **Change password** next to the appropriate user. A pop-up displays.

5. Enter a new password, or automatically generate one, then click **Update password**.

You can now [connect to your deployment](/opensearch/how-to/connect-to-opensearch-deployment/) using the new credentials.
