DNS (Domain Name System) is a service that translates the IP address of computers connected to the internet into human-readable domain names, and vice versa. In an environment with a limited amount of Linux machines, it is possible to use the `/etc/hosts` file for associating an IP address to a DNS name. But when you have a large infrastructure with lots of systems/resources, `/etc/hosts` may quickly become cumbersome.

[BIND](https://www.isc.org/bind/) or Berkeley Internet Name Domain is open-source software that implements DNS protocols for the internet. In this tutorial, we need a DNS server machine & a client machine for testing.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- `sudo` privileges or access to the root user

## Installing BIND

1. Install the latest version of BIND 9.20 and related tools:
    ```
    apt-get install bind9 bind9utils bind9-doc dnsutils
    ```
2. Verify the installed version:
    ```
    named -v
    ```
    The expected output should be:
    ```
    BIN 9.20.x
    ```


## Configuring the primary DNS server

1. Edit the `name.conf.local` file:
    ```
    cd /etc/bind
    nano named.conf.locale
    ```
2. Paste the following. Make sure to edit the domain name and the IP address of the secondary machine.
    ```
    //
    // Do any local configuration here
    //

    // Consider adding the 1918 zones here, if they are not used in your
    // organization
    //include "/etc/bind/zones.rfc1918";

    zone "example.com" IN {
        type master;
        file "/etc/bind/db.example.com";
        allow-update { 192.0.2.2; };
        allow-transfer { 192.0.2.2; };
        notify yes;
    };
    ```
3. Create your zone file. A zone file must contain at least an SOA, an NS, and an A record or CNAME.
    ```
    sudo nano /etc/bind/db.example.com
    ```
4. Paste the following:
    ```
    $TTL    10800
    @       IN      SOA     ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. (
                            2024111801 ; Serial
                            10800      ; Refresh
                            3600       ; Retry
                            604800     ; Expire
                            86400 )    ; Negative Cache TTL

    ; Name servers
    @       IN      NS      ns1.example.com.
    @       IN      NS      ns2.example.com.

    ; A and AAAA records
    ns1     IN      A       192.0.2.1
    ns2     IN      A       192.0.2.2

    ; Example host
    www     IN      A       192.0.2.3
    www     IN      AAAA    2001:db8::1
    ```

5. Enable DNSSEC (optional but recommended):
    ```
    sudo dnssec-keygen -a RSASHA256 -b 2048 -n ZONE example.com
    sudo dnssec-signzone -o example.com /etc/bind/db.example.com-
    ```

6. Restart the BIND server:
    ```
    systemctl restart bind9
    ```

## Configuring the secondary DNS server

1. Edit the `name.conf.local` file:
    ```
    cd /etc/bind
    nano named.conf.local
    ```

2. Add the slave zone definition:
    ```
    //
    // Do any local configuration here
    //

    // Consider adding the 1918 zones here, if they are not used in your
    // organization
    //include "/etc/bind/zones.rfc1918";
    zone "example.com" IN {
        type slave;
        file "/etc/bind/db.example.com";
        masters { 192.0.2.1; };
        allow-transfer { none; };
    };
    ```
    <Message type="note">
      Replace `example.com` and the IP address of your primary server.
    </Message>

3. Restart the BIND service.
    ```
    service bind9 restart
    ```

### Testing the Configuration

1. Check the primary DNS server:
   ```bash
   dig @192.0.2.1 www.example.com
   ```

2. Verify the secondary DNS server:
   ```bash
   dig @192.0.2.2 www.example.com
   ```

   Expected output for both:
   ```
   ;; ANSWER SECTION:
   www.example.com.    86400   IN  A   192.0.2.3
   ```

3. Test zone replication:
   Restart the primary DNS server and check the logs on the secondary server:
   ```bash
   sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
   ```

## Security and best Practices

- Use `allow-transfer` and `allow-update` directives to limit who can query or modify your DNS zones.
- Sign your zones using DNSSEC to protect against DNS spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Use `rndc` or log analysis tools to monitor DNS queries and server performance.


## Conclusion

You have successfully configured a DNS server using BIND 9.20. You can now resolve domain names within your infrastructure or serve DNS queries to external clients.

For more advanced configurations and features, refer to the [official BIND 9.20 documentation](https://kb.isc.org/docs/isc-bind-9).
