All user accounts are [Organizations](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts#organization). When you [create a Scaleway account](/console/my-account/how-to/create-an-account), you are the [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts#owner) of your Organization. If you are invited to a someone else's Organization, you will simultaneously be the Owner of your own Organization and an [IAM user](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts#user) in the other Organization, where you will have the rights and permissions accorded to you via [policies](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts#policy).

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have been invited to join an [Organization](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts#organization)

</Message>

When someone invites you to join their Organization, you receive an email to inform you.

1. Click **Accept Invitation** from your email invitation. The Scaleway console opens in a browser window. A pop-up displays introducing you to the Organization.

2. Click **Next** to proceed. The Organization dashboard displays. 

  You may be prompted to try creating a resource or viewing the [default Project](). You can choose to try these actions out, or simply close the window.

3. Click the Organization name in the Organization menu.

  <Message type="note">

  The Organization name is identical to the account Owner. 
  If the account was created without the Owner's name, 
  it will be the prefix of the email used to create the account. 
  For example, if the email used is `myemail@example.com`, 
  the Organization name will be `myemail`. In this case, 
  the Organization name can be set to the account owner's name, but only once.

  </Message>

  A message displays asking you to **Check your email**.

4. Check your email and click **Verify**.

5. Click **I Agree to the Terms of Service and Scaleway's Data Protection Agreement** to confirm.

The Scaleway console opens in the browser.
