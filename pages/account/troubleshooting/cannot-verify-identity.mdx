## Problem
I can't complete the identity verification process on the Scaleway console.

### Symptoms
- You see an 'Invalid ID document' message when trying to complete the verification process
- You receive an error message or get blocked when trying to verify your identity
- You don't see an **Upload** button to send your identity for verification
- You received the message, 'We were unable to verify your identity. Contact Support for assistance' when you tried to add your ID

### Possible causes
- The verification time has elapsed
- The photo of your identity document is too blurred or illegible for our verification software to read
- You are using an identification document issued by a [country not yet supported by Scaleway](/billing/troubleshooting/cannot-find-my-country)
- You have used an invalid document
- You were in the process of verifying your identity and closed the window before its completion
- Your account has raised security flags, triggering our safety system

### Solution
- If more than 15 minutes have elapsed since the start of the verification process, contact our Support team for a manual verification.
- Take a new photo, ensuring you are in a well-lit environment, and keep the document stable, avoiding any movements.
- Ensure you are using an accepted document. We currently accept national identity cards (including resident permits) and passports as identification documents.
- If you abandon the verification process, you may see a status `Invalid ID document`. If that happens, open a support ticket, informing our agents that you left the verification process unfinished and would like to complete it.
- If you have received a message saying that your account requires further or manual validation, contact our Trust & Safety team via a [support ticket](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elementssupport/tickets/create). Be prepared to provide additional documentation to complete the account verification.

## Going further
If you have tried the solutions above, but they have failed, please [contact our Support team](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elementssupport/tickets/create), providing the following information:
  - A copy of your identity card or passport (front and back)
  - A selfie of yourself holding the same identification document provided next to your face

Our Trust & Safety team will study your request and get back to you.
