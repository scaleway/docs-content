## How to import and query an example data set

### Creating a database and ingesting data

<Message type="note">
This example is based on the **New York Taxi Data** from the [Official ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/getting-started/example-datasets/nyc-taxi).
</Message>

1. Run the command below to create a new database:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE nyc_taxi;
    ```

2. Create a new table in the database you just created:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE nyc_taxi.trips_small (
        trip_id             UInt32,
        pickup_datetime     DateTime,
        dropoff_datetime    DateTime,
        pickup_longitude    Nullable(Float64),
        pickup_latitude     Nullable(Float64),
        dropoff_longitude   Nullable(Float64),
        dropoff_latitude    Nullable(Float64),
        passenger_count     UInt8,
        trip_distance       Float32,
        fare_amount         Float32,
        extra               Float32,
        tip_amount          Float32,
        tolls_amount        Float32,
        total_amount        Float32,
        payment_type        Enum('CSH' = 1, 'CRE' = 2, 'NOC' = 3, 'DIS' = 4, 'UNK' = 5),
        pickup_ntaname      LowCardinality(String),
        dropoff_ntaname     LowCardinality(String)
    )
    ENGINE = MergeTree
    PRIMARY KEY (pickup_datetime, dropoff_datetime);
    ```

3. Insert data from an Amazon S3 bucket 
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO nyc_taxi.trips_small
    SELECT
        trip_id,
        pickup_datetime,
        dropoff_datetime,
        pickup_longitude,
        pickup_latitude,
        dropoff_longitude,
        dropoff_latitude,
        passenger_count,
        trip_distance,
        fare_amount,
        extra,
        tip_amount,
        tolls_amount,
        total_amount,
        payment_type,
        pickup_ntaname,
        dropoff_ntaname
    FROM s3(
        'https://datasets-documentation.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/nyc-taxi/trips_{0..2}.gz',
        'TabSeparatedWithNames'
    );
    ```

### Querying the database

1. Run the command below to count the rows you inserted in the table:
    ```sql
    SELECT count()
    FROM nyc_taxi.trips_small;
    ```

2. Run the command below to list the 10 first rows of your table:
    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM nyc_taxi.trips_small
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

3. Run the command below to display the 10 first neighborhoods with the most frequent pickups:
    ```sql
    SELECT
      pickup_ntaname,
      count(*) AS count
    FROM nyc_taxi.trips_small WHERE pickup_ntaname != ''
    GROUP BY pickup_ntaname
    ORDER BY count DESC
    LIMIT 10;
    ```
