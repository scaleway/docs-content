3. Click **Create a Placement Group**. The creation wizard displays.

4. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 

    - Enter a **Name** for your Placement Group, or leave the randomly-generated name in place. 
    - Choose an **Availability Zone**, which is the geographical region where your Placement Group will be created. You can only add Instances from this  same Availability Zone to the Placement Group.
    - Choose the **Type** of Placement Group:
      - **Low Latency** groups ensure that Instances are located as close as possible to each other
      - **Maximum Availability** groups ensure that Instances do not run on the same physical hypervisor 
    - Choose the **Policy** for your Placement Group:
      - **Enforced** means that, if the group cannot be applied, only Instances on hypervisors matching the group settings will boot
      - **Optional** ensures that the settings of the Placemet Group are applied wherever possible, but lets Instances boot on hypervisors that don't match the group policy.
    - Add **Instances** to the Placement Group.
