## Yunohost Overview

[Yunohost](https://yunohost.org/) is an open-source solution designed for the administration of a personal server. It helps manage users, domains, websites and comes with a full email stack. The tool is designed to be lightweight and intuitive and is designed to work with Debian 9 (Stretch).

## Installing Yunohost

1. Connect to the Instance via [SSH](/en/docs/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).

2. Update the APT packet cache and the software already installed on the instance:

  ```
  apt update && apt upgrade -y
  ```

3. Create a non-root user which will be used for the installation of Yunohost:

  ```
  adduser jamie
  ```

4. Give root permission to the user by adding it to the sudoers file and switch into the users account:

  ```
  usermod -aG sudo jamie && su jamie
  ```

5. Enter into the `/tmp` directory. This is a temporary directory and files located within are deleted upon the next reboot. As there is no need to keep the Yunohost installation script, it can be downloaded into this folder.

  ```
  cd /tmp
  ```

6. Download the installation script. It will be saved in the file `yunohost`:

  ```
  wget -O yunohost https://install.yunohost.org/
  ```

7. The installation of Yunohost is automated. Run the script with sudo to launch the installation process. Once prompted enter the password of the non-root user to start the installation:

  ```
  wget -O yunohost https://install.yunohost.org/
  ```

  During the installation, a prompt will ask for permission to overwrite configuration files. Confirm this by selecting **Yes**.
  Yunohost might ask to reconfigure SSH, select **Yes** to disable the root login and to login with the administrator account created by the application.

  The installation may take some time to download and install all required packages. Once it has completed the following message appears:

  ```
  [ OK ] YunoHost installation completed !
  ```

8. Run the post-installation script to set the administrator password and main domain name:

  ```
  sudo yunohost tools postinstall
  ```

  Once completed, can open a web browser and open the IP Address of the instance.

9. A warning may appear in your browser, as the SSL certificate of Yunohost is self-signed:

  Click **Advanced** to proceed to the site, which will display the login prompt:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-yunohost_02.png" alt="" />

10. To retrieve the DNS zone information which is required for the configuration of the domain name with Yunohost, click Domain in the main menu:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-yunohost_03.png" alt="" />

11. Click the domain name, then on **DNS Configuration** to display an ideal DNS configuration of the domain name:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-yunohost_04.png" alt="" />

  <Message type="important">

  Yunohost does not manage the DNS Zone. It is required to enter this information in the DNS interface of the domains registrar.

  </Message>

12. Once DNS zone has been updated with the required information, request a [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) SSL certificate to encrypt the connection between a visitor and the server. Yunohost manages the certificate handling. Request it by clicking on **SSL Certificate** in the Overview of the domain, then on **Install a Let's Encrypt Certificate**:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-yunohost_07.png" alt="" />

  Yunohost will request the certificate now, this may take a few minutes. Once the certificate has been issued, it will be visible in the configuration interface:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-yunohost_08.png" alt="" />

### Creating a user

To use the server, it is recommended to create a user. It will have an e-mail address `user@domain.tld` and can be used to configure additional applications.

Go to the admin interface of Yunohost and click **Users** > **New User**. Fill in the required information for the new user:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-yunohost_09.png" alt="" />

### Installing an application

Yunohost comes with a bunch of pre-packaged Applications that can easily be installed on the server with two simple clicks from the management interface. A full list of all available applications is available [here](https://yunohost.org/#/apps).

Install a webmail application to write and read emails of the previously created user directly in a web browser:

1. Go to the admin Interface of Yunohost and click **Applications** to land on the applications list:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-yunohost_10.png" alt="" />

2. Scroll down to **Roundcube** and click **Install** to install a Webmail client. Fill in the required details for the application and click **Install** to launch the installation of the tool:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-yunohost_11.png" alt="" />

3. Once installed go to `yourdomain.tld/webmail` to connect to the Webmail interface to read and write mails:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-yunohost_12.png" alt="" />

The basic installation of Yunohost is done now, it is possible to install other Applications like a WordPress Blog, a Torrent application and much more to have a personal server.
