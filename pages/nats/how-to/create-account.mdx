To start using a NATS message broker, you must first create a NATS account. This sets a scope for your NATS credentials, messages, queues and stream.


<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to create a NATS account

1. Click **NATS** in the **Data and Analytics** section of the Scaleway console side menu. 

2. Click **Create a NATS account**. The creation wizard displays.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:

    - Choose a **region**, which is the geographical location in which your NATS account will be created.
    - Enter a **name** for your NATS account, or use the auto-generated name suggested for you.
    - Optional: Use the *Estimated cost** calculator to simulate how messages sent and stored with NATS streams will be billed. Note that simply creating a NATS account does not in itself incur any billing. For more information about NATS billing, see the [FAQ](/nats/faq/#how-is-nats-billed).
    - Click **Create NATS account** to finish.

    You are directed to the listing of your NATS accounts, where your newly-created NATS account now appears.

    You can create more NATS accounts in your pre-selected region if you wish, by clicking on the `+ Create NATS account` button. To create NATS accounts in other regions, repeat the steps above starting from step 2 and selecting the required region.
