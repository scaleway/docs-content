A Serverless Function only works with a strict list of possible resources. When deploying a Serverless Function, make sure to use one of the following pair of memory (MB) and CPU (mVCPU):
- 128 and 70
- 256 and 140
- 512 and 280
- 1024 and 560
- 2048 and 1120
- 3072 and 1680
- 4096 and 2240

For example, using the Scaleway API:
```
...
"memory_limit": "128",
"cpu_limit": "70",
...
```
