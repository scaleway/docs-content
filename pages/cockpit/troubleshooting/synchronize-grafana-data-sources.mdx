This page shows you how to visualize your data again when it does not display on your Grafana dashboards, using the `SyncGrafanaDataSources` [endpoint](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/cockpit/global-api/#path-grafana-synchronize-grafana-data-sources) of the [Cockpit Global API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/cockpit/global-api/#path-grafana-synchronize-grafana-data-sources) or the [Scaleway CLI](https://cli.scaleway.com/cockpit/#get-your-cockpits-grafana).

<Message type="important">

## Problem

- Many Cockpit users often encounter issues with Grafana data sources not synchronizing properly, leading to missing data on dashboards when data should be available.

  When users open their Grafana dashboards, they see a `No data` message along with an error banner stating: `Failed to upgrade legacy queries datasource was not found`.

  <Lightbox image={image} alt="Grafana dashboard showing error messages and warning signs of no data found for the user's datasources" />

- Your Cockpit is unavailable.
- You cannot view your logs and/or metrics in Grafana.
- Your Cockpit data sources are not configured.
- You cannot view your dashboards in Grafana.

## Cause

These issues often occur due to synchronization failures between Cockpit and Grafana, preventing dashboards from displaying the latest logs and metrics as expected.

## Solution

### Using the Scaleway API

Open a terminal and run the following command to trigger the synchronization of your data sources:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"project_id":"$SCALEWAY_PROJECT_ID"}' \
    "https://api.scaleway.com/cockpit/v1/grafana/sync-data-sources"
    ```

Make sure that you replace `$SCW_SECRET_KEY` with your API secret key and `$SCALEWAY_PROJECT_ID` with the ID of the Scaleway Project affected by the issue.

### Using the Scaleway CLI

Open a terminal and run the following command:
    ```bash
    scw cockpit grafana sync-data-sources project-id=<PROJECT-ID>
    ```

Make sure that you replace `<PROJECT-ID>` with the ID of the Scaleway Project affected by the issue.
