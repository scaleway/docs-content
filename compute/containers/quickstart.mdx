A container is a package of software that includes all dependencies: code, runtime, configuration, and system libraries so that the software can run on any host system. The Scaleway Elements Containers platform provides you with custom Docker images that are entirely handled for you in the cloud. You can use your favorite technologies such as Django or Ruby On Rails for your containers. We show you how to create a Containers namespace, deploy a contaner, and delete it when you're done.

## How to create a Containers namespace

1. Click **Containers** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Containers page displays.

2. Click **Create a namespace**. The Containers namespace creation wizard displays.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 

    - Enter a **name** and optionally a **description** for your namespace. The name must only contain alphanumeric characters.
    - Choose a **region**, which is the geographical location in which your namespace will be deployed.
    - Enter any **environment variables** required for your namespace. Environment variables configured in a namespace will be available in all containers/apps within the same namespace. For each environment variable, click **+Add** and ender the key/value pair.
    - Verify the **estimated cost**.

4. Click **Create a namespace** to finish.

Your namespace is now created and you are taken to its **Containers** tab.

## How to deploy a container

1. Click **Containers** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Containers page displays.

2. Click the relevant Containers namespace. 

3. Click **Deploy a Container**. The Container creation wizard displays.

4. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 

    - Choose an **image** from your Container Registry. Select the required Container Registry Namespace from the dropdown list, and then select the container and tag.
    - Choose a **name** for your container, and optionally a **description**. The name must only contain alphanumeric characters.
    - Choose the **resources** to be allocated to your container at runtime. These define the performance characteristics of your container.
    - Set your **scaling** preferences, or leave them at default values. The Scaleway platform autoscales the number of available instances of your container to match the incoming load, depending on the settings you define here.
    - Define any **environment variables** you want to inject into your container. For each environment variable, click **+Add** and enter the key/value pair.
    - Set the desired **privacy policy** for your container. This defines whether container invocation may be done anonymously (**public**) or only via an authentication mechanism provided by Scaleway (**private**). 
    - Optionally, use the **advanced options** to add [triggers](/compute/containers/concepts/#trigger) to your container deployment. Adding triggers enables the container to handle events coming from sources other than an HTTP endpoint, such as CRON (time-based jobs), MQTT queues and more. 
    - Verify the **Estimated Cost**.

5. Click **Deploy a container** to finish.

## How to delete a container

1. Click **Containers** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Containers page displays.

2. Click the relevant Containers namespace.

2. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the container you want to delete, and select **Delete** from the drop down menu. 

3. Type **DELETE** in the pop-up that asks you to confirm the action, then click **Delete this container**.

  You can also delete a container from the [Container settings tab](/compute/containers/how-to/modify-container-privacy/).
