The Pub/Sub feature is available with Redis™ 6 and 7.

Pub/Sub is a highly scalable messaging model fit to handle large amounts of data and that enables asynchronous communication on low bandwidth.

The model decouples **the publishers**, the clients sending a message, from **the subscribers**, the one or several clients receiving the message. Messages are published to a third component, the message **broker**, whose job is to forward messages from publishers to subscribers under **topics**.

Topics describe the data contained within messages, allowing subscribers to choose which messages to receive based on the subject of the topic. For example, a under a topic named `/weather-paris` one could expect to find data about the weather in Paris.

To implement Pub/Sub system using Redis, you can run commands such as `PUBLISH` and `SUBSCRIBE`.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have a [Redis™ Database Instance](/managed-databases/redis/quickstart) with Redis™ version 6 or 7
</Message>

1. [Connect to your Redis™ Database Instance](/managed-databases/redis/how-to/connect-to-redis-database-instance).
2. Subscribe to a topic. In this tutorial, we will use `temperature` as an example of topic.
    ```
    > SUBSCRIBE temperature
    Reading messages... (press Ctrl-C to quit)
    1) "subscribe"
    2) "myqueue"
    3) (integer) 1
    ```
3. Publish to the topic in a separate client. You can connect to the same Redis™ Database Instance in a different terminal to do so.
    ```
    > PUBLISH temperature monday/12C
    (integer) 1
    ```
4. Read the message in the first terminal, where you are subscribed to the `temperature` topic. You can see the update in real-time.
    ```
    > SUBSCRIBE temperature
    1) "subscribe"
    2) "temperature"
    3) (integer) 1
    1) "message"
    2) "temperature"
    3) "monday/12C"
    ```
    All other subscribers of the `temperature` topic will receive the same messages.
