An Edge Services **W**eb **A**pplication **F**irewall (WAF) evaluates requests to your Load Balancer origin to determine whether they are potentially malicious. You can choose the [paranoia level](/edge-services/concepts/#paranoia-level) to be used when evaluating requests, and set [exclusions](/edge-services/concepts/#exclusions) to define traffic that shouldn't be filtered by WAF. Requests that are judged to be malicious are blocked or logged, depending on the settings you choose.

This page walks you through the processing of enabling and configuring WAF to protect your Load Balancer origin. 

To read more about how WAF works, try our [Understanding WAF](/edge-services/reference-content/understanding-waf/) page.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An Edge Services pipeline for a [Load Balancer](/edge-services/how-to/create-pipeline-lb/) origin

## How to enable and configure WAF

1. In the Scaleway console, navigate to the Edge Services dashboard for the Load Balancer pipeline on which you want to enable WAF:
    TODO UPDATE
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-services-dashboard.webp" alt="A screenshot of the Edge Services dashboard in the Scaleway console. This is a dashboard for Edge Services on an Object Storage bucket, showing links to the documentation, Scaleway Cockpit, the endpoint, cache settings and a button to disable the pipeline." />

2. In the **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** panel, use the <Icon name="toggle" /> icon to enable WAF.

    A pop-up displays:

    TODO SCREENSHOT

3. Choose the **paranoia level**, from 1 - 4, that is best adapted to your use case. The higher the paranoia level, the more sensitive WAF is to potential threats, and the more likely it is to class a request as malicious. For help with choosing a paranoia level, see our [dedicated documentation](/edge-services/reference-content/understanding-waf/#waf-ruleset-and-paranoia-levels).

        <Message type="tip">
        After enabling WAF, you will be able to [set exclusions](#how-to-set-exclusions) that filter out requests matching certain criteria from being evaluated by WAF.
        </Message>

4. Select a WAF **mode**. Requests judged to be malicious can either be **blocked** and prevented from passing to the Load Balancer origin, or **logged** but allowed to pass.

5. Click **Save**

WAF is enabled and you are returned to your Edge Services pipeline overview. You can disable or edit WAF settings at any time.

## How to set exclusions

Once you have enabled WAF, you can choose to set **exclusions**. Exclusions are a set of filters: requests that match the filters are not evaluated by WAF, and pass directly to your Load Balancer origin.

1. In the Scaleway console, navigate to the Edge Services dashboard for the Load Balancer pipeline on which you want to set WAF exclusions.

2. In the **WAF** panel, click **+ Add exclusions**. WAF goes into Edit mode.

    <Message type="note">
    You can only add exclusions **after** you have already enabled WAF.
    </Message>

    The following screen displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-add-exclusions.webp" alt="A screenshot of the Add exclusions popup in the Scaleway console, with an 'if' box to set a path regex value, and a 'then' box pre-filled to 'Bypass WAF'" /> TODO CHANGE NEW BUTTON?

3. Set up to two filters for this exclusion. You can add either:
    - One ***Path regex** filter, to match paths of requests to exclude. For example, `/api/v1/.*`
    - One **HTTP method** filter, to match te HTTP methods of requests to exclude. For example, enter one or more of `GET`, `PATCH`, `PUT`, `DELETE` etc. Requests that match any of these methods will be considered to match the HTTP method filter.
    - One of each of the above (use the **Add filter** button to add the second filter)

    If you include both a path regex and an HTTP method filter in the same exclusion, requests must match both of the filters in order to be excluded.

    Currently, the only action possible to set for matching requests is **Bypass WAF** (matching requests will not be evaluated by WAF and will proceed directly to the Load Balancer origin.) In the future, more actions will be added.

4. Click **Add** to add the exclusion.

  You are returned to your Edge Services pipeline overview.

5. **Optional** Click **Add exclusions** to add more exclusions, if you wish (maximum 100). Follow steps 3 to 4 each time.

6. Click **Save changes** to exit Edit mode and save all the exclusions you added.

## How to edit exclusions

1. In the Scaleway console, navigate to the Edge Services dashboard for the Load Balancer pipeline on which you want to edit WAF exclusions.

2. In the WAF panel, click <Icon name="edit" /> next to the exclusion you want to edit.

3. Make edits to the filters as required. Remember, you cannot add more than one filter of each type (maximum of one path regex and one HTTP method filter per exclusion).

4. Click **Confirm** when you have finished editing.

    You are returned to your Edge Services pipeline overview, but you are still in Edit mode.

5. Continue to edit or delete other exclusions as necessary.

6. Click **Save changes** to exit Edit mode and save all your changes.

## How to delete exclusions

1. In the Scaleway console, navigate to the Edge Services dashboard for the Load Balancer pipeline on which you want to delete WAF exclusions.

2. In the WAF panel, click <Icon name="delete" /> next to the exclusion you want to delete. 

    WAF goes into Edit mode, and a pop-up displays, asking you to confirm the deletion.

3. Click **Delete**.

    You are returned to your Edge Services pipeline overview, but you are still in Edit mode.

4. Continue to edit or delete other exclusions as necessary.

6. Click **Save changes** to exit Edit mode and save all your changes and deletions.

## How to edit WAF configuration

You can edit WAF's paranoia level and mode (log or block) at any time.

1. In the Scaleway console, navigate to the Edge Services dashboard for the Load Balancer pipeline on which you want to edit WAF.

2. In the WAF panel, click <Icon name="edit" />.

3. Edit the paranoia level and mode as required.

4. Click **Save**.

    Your edits are saved, and you are returned to teh Edge Services pipeline dashboard.

## How to disable WAF

You can disable WAF at any time.

1. In the Scaleway console, navigate to the Edge Services dashboard for the Load Balancer pipeline on which you want to disable WAF.

2. In the WAF panel, click **Disable WAF**.

    A pop-up displays, informing you that WAF will no longer evaluate, block or log requests to your Load Balancer origin.

3. Click **Disable** to confirm.

    WAF is disabled and you are returned to your Edge Services' pipeline overview.
