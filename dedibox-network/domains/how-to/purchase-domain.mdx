A domain name is the equivalent of your postal address on the web, and allows your users to find your website. Scaleway offers you the possibility of buying a domain name with or without web hosting. Depending on availability, you can buy the domain name and extension (.com, .fr, .net etc) of your choice.

1. In your browser, navigate to [the domain name order page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/domain/).
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-order-domain.webp" alt="" />
2. Enter the domain name of your choice in the search bar and click **search a domain**. The **Domain name choice** page displays, showing whether the domain is available and for which extensions.
    <Message type="tip">
      If the domain name is not available because you are already the owner, you have the option to transfer the domain so that Scaleway becomes your new registrar and you can manage your hosting and domain from the same location. See the [relevant documentation](/dedibox-network/domains/how-to/transfer-domain) for more information.

3. Select an available domain-name/extension combination from the list by clicking the checkbox next to it.

      Some Top Level Domain (TLD) extensions have special requirements that owners must comply with. You may be asked for verification if you order or renew one of these extensions. Find out more [here](/dedibox-network/domains/concepts/#tld-specifications-at-scaleway)

      You must always keep the contact details relating to the owner of your domain name accurate and up to date. Once created, if you wish to change details pertaining to the identity of the owner (full name(s) of a natural person or corporate name for a legal entity) this must be done by the [change of owner / applicant]/dedibox-network/domains/how-to/change-ownership) process via the relevant page of the [console](https://console.online.net/fr/domain/trade).
