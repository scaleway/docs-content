The [Public Gateway](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#public-gateway) feature of the [Private Network](/network/vpc/concepts/#private-networks) allows Instances in your Private Network to reach resources on the Internet without using a public IP address.

In this documentation, you will learn how to create an Instance without a public IP address, create a Private Network with a Public Gateway, and a route from your Instance to an Object Storage bucket.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created an Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)
</Message>

## How to create an Instance without a public IP

Follow the instructions for [creating an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance). We create an Instance without a flexible IP using the following specifications for our Instance:
  - **Availability Zone**: `nl-ams-1` (but you can select the AZ of your choice).
  - **OS Image**: Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa
  - **Instance type**: DEV1-S
  - **Advanced options**: Untick the flexible IP option

<Message type="tip">
  You could also use one of the following methods to create your Instance:
  - Use [this link](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers/create?area=nl-ams&imageGroup=distribution_ubuntu&imageKey=3f1b9623-71ba-4fe3-b994-27fcdaa850ba&offerName=DEV1-S&region=nl-ams-1&selectedImageTab=distribution&selectedServerGroup=Development&serverKey=nl-ams-2DEV1-S&zone=nl-ams-1) to automatically configure your Instance in the console with the required parameters. Just click **Create Instance** to launch the instance creation process.
  - If you have installed the Scaleway CLI tool, create the Instance using the following command:
      ```
      scw instance server create type=DEV1-S zone=nl-ams-1 image=ubuntu_bionic root-volume=l:20G name=objectstorage-over-pn ip=none
      ```

## How to create a Private Network and attach the Instance

1. Follow the instructions for [creating a Private Network](/network/vpc/how-to/create-private-network/). Make sure you create it in the region that encompasses the Availability Zone of the Instance you previously created.
2. Follow the instructions to [attach your Instance to the Private Network](/network/vpc/how-to/attach-resources-to-pn/).

## How to create a Public Gateway and attach the Private Network

1. Follow the instructions for [creating a Public Gateway](/network/public-gateways/how-to/create-a-public-gateway/):
    - Select the same Availability Zone as for your previously created Instance.
    - Leave the IP configuration empty to allocate a new IP to your Public Gateway.
    - You can choose a gateway type, name and tags according to your choice.
    After creating your Public Gateway, you are directed to a list of this and any other Public Gateways you have previously created.
2. Click on your new Public Gateway's name. The gateway's dashboard displays.
3. Click the **Private Networks** tab.
4. Click **Attach to a new Private Network**. A pop-up window displays.
5. Select **Attach to an existing Private Network** and pick a Private Network from the drop-down list. Set **Dynamic NAT** to active.
6. Click **Attach to Private Network**.

## How to set the Object Storage Route

1. SSH into your Instance using the following command:
    ```
    ssh root@your_virtual_instance_ip
    ```

    <Message type="note">
    As your Instance has no public IP address, you must connect to it using another Instance in your Private Network or assign a temporary public IP to it.

    </Message>
2. Configure the following route to the Object Storage platform:
    ```sh
    # set this to keep the network on the instance
    ip route add 10.0.0.0/8 via `ip route | grep default | awk '{print $3} '` dev ens2
    # dhcp on pn interface
    dhclient ens5
    # change default route
    ip route del default via `ip route | grep default | awk '{print $3} '` dev ens2
    ip route add default via 192.168.42.1 dev ens5 # use the gateway ip in the gateway's description
    curl https://s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud
    ```

## Conclusion

You have now configured an Instance with a Private Network to communicate with Scaleway's Object Storage platform using the Public Gateway feature. The gateway ensures the exchange of data between your Private Network and the public Internet.
