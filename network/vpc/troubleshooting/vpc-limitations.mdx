This page sets out some current limitations of Scaleway's VPC.

- The only product currently available within the regional VPC is Private Networks.
- Up to 512 resources can be attached to a Private Network.
- A resource can be attached to up to 8 Private Networks.
- The following resource types can be attached to a Private Network:
  - Instances
  - Elastic Metal servers
  - Load Balancers
  - Public Gateways
  - Managed Databases for PostgreSQL and MySQL
  - Managed Databases for Redisâ„¢ (only during the process of creating the database)
  - Kubernetes Kapsule (only during the process of creating the Kapsule cluster)
- Private Networks are not supported on some legacy Instance offers which have reached EOL, e.g. `VC1`, `START1` and `X64-*GB`. Note that all Instance offers in the [current product catalogue](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/?tags=compute) are supported.
