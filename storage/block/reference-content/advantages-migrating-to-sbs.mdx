## Transitioning from the Instance API to the Block Storage API for volume and snapshot management

Scaleway is transitioning the management of all Block Storage legacy volumes and snapshots from the [Instance API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/) to the [Block Storage API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/block/). All Block Storage volumes and snapshots created via the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) will no longer be available from the [Compute section](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/), but from the [Storage section](https://console.scaleway.com/block-storage).

This change provides you with enhanced performance and advanced storage capabilities. If you have created volumes and snapshots via the Instance API, we **strongly recommend migrating them to the Block Storage API** to benefit from these improvements.

Local volumes will remain exclusively supported by the Instance API.

## Key advantages of using the Block Storage API

By migrating your Block Storage volumes and snapshots to the Block Storage API, you take advantage of the following benefits:

- **Low latency**: volumes managed by the Block Storage API leverage modern hardware, ensuring faster access times and smoother performance.
- **Higher IOPS performance**: benefit from up to 5K IOPS (input/output operations per second) with Block Storage Low Latency volumes and 15K IOPS with higher-tier offerings. These performance improvements are ideal for applications requiring rapid data access and high-speed operations.

## Differences between volumes managed by the Instance API and the Block Storage API

Volumes created with the Instance API differ from those created with the Block Storage API in both hardware and performance characteristics:

### Underlying hardware

Instance API volumes are built on **older-generation SSDs**, resulting in **slower performance and have a higher latency**, which may impact the responsiveness of applications.

Block Storage API volumes are powered by **modern NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) disks**, which are optimized for **high-speed operations**. They also have **advanced hardware** which ensures faster data access and lower latency.

### Performance

Instance API volumes have a **limited performance** due to older SSD technology. They also have a **lower IOPS and slower data processing speed**.

Block Storage API volumes benefit from e**nhanced performance with up to 15K IOPS**.

### Latency

Instance API volumes have a **higher latency**, making them less suitable for applications requiring quick data retrieval.

Block Storage API volumes have a **reduced latency** which ensures faster application response times. They are ideal for workloads requiring rapid and reliable data access.

## Why you should migrate your volumes and snapshot

Currently, two APIs manage Block Storage volumes on Scaleway: the Instance API and the Scaleway Block Storage API. Maintaining both APIs for the same product is not sustainable.

Migrating your volumes to the Block Storage API ensures you benefit from:

- The latest in storage technology with NVMe-powered performance
- Improved reliability and scalability for your applications
- Ongoing support and updates tailored for volumes and snapshots managed with the Block Storage API
