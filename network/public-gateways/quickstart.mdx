<Macro id="network-public-gateways" />

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- Created a [Private Network](/network/vpc/how-to/create-private-network/)

## How to create a Public Gateway

1. Click **Public Gateways** in the **Network** section of the side menu.
2. Click **Create Public Gateway** to launch the Public Gateway creation wizard.
3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Choose an **Availability Zone**, which is the geographical location in which your Public Gateway will be created. Note that in order to attach a Public Gateway to a Private Network, the gateway must be in an Availability Zone within the Private Network's region.
    - Choose a **Public Gateway Type**, which impacts the pricing and bandwidth of your gateway.
    - Choose an **IP**. You can choose to assign one of your existing flexible IPs to your Public Gateway, or create and assign a new public IP. 
    - Choose a **Name** for your Public Gateway, and, optionally, tags.
    - Verify the **Estimated Cost** of your Public Gateway, based on the specifications you chose.
4. Click **Create Public Gateway** to finish.

    Your Public Gateway is created and you are redirected to the **Public Gateways** dashboard, where your newly-created Public Gateway now displays.

## How to attach your Public Gateway to a Private Network

1. Click **Public Gateways** in the **Network** section of the side menu.
2. Click the Public Gateway that you want to attach to a Private Network. You are taken to the **Overview** page for that Public Gateway.
3. Click the **Private Networks** tab. A list of Private Networks attached to the Public Gateway displays.
4. Click <Icon name="plus" /> to attach a new Private Network to the Public Gateway. A pop-up displays.
5. Choose to attach an existing or a new Private Network.
    - If you want to attach an existing Private Network, select **Attach to an existing Private Network** and choose the desired network from the drop-down list.
    <Message type="note">
        Only Private Networks which are in the same region as the Public Gateway are displayed in this list.
    </Message>
    - If you want to create and attach a new Private Network, select **Attach to a new Private Network**. A default name will be suggested for you, but feel free to overwrite this with a new name of your choice.
6. Use the toggle <Icon name="toggle" /> to tell the gateway whether or not it should [advertise the default route](/network/public-gateways/concepts/#default-route) to the internet for attached resources.
7. Click **Attach to Private Network** to finish. You are taken back to the Private Networks tab, where the network you attached now appears, along with the services configured and the IP address of the Public Gateway.

    Your Private Network is now attached to your Public Gateway. You can repeat the steps above to attach more Private Networks to the same Public Gateway if you wish.
