Serverless Functions are an asynchronous microservices architecture where event sources are decorrelated from event consumers.

They work best when they are triggered by specific events, such as cron schedules, which means they can be edited without having to modify every microservice in the process.


In this tutorial, you will create the following resources to use your functions:

- A project dedicated to this tutorial
- Two buckets to store media
- A queue to manage events
- IAM credentials to secure your environment
- Cockpit to monitor your functions.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- Installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- At least 10 JPG or PNG images

## Creating a Project

1. Click the **Projects** tab from the [Organization Dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/organization). A list of your Projects displays.
2. Click **+ Create Project** on the right-hand side. A pop-up displays.
3. Name the project `Functions Tutorial`.
4. Click **Create Project**. The new Project is added to the list.

## Creating the source bucket

1. Click **Object Storage** under **Storage** on the left side menu of the console. The Object Storage dashboard displays.
3. Click **+ Create a bucket**.
4. Name it `source-images-<YOUR_NAME>`.
5. Choose the **AMSTERDAM** Region.
6. Set the bucket visibility to **Private**.
7. Click **Create Bucket**. The bucket **Files** tab displays.
8. Upload your images to the bucket and select the **Standard** storage class.

## Creating the destination bucket

1. Click **Storage**, then **Object Storage** on the left side menu of the console. The Object Storage dashboard displays.
2. Click **+ Create a bucket**.
3. Name it `dest-images-<YOUR_NAME>`.
4. Choose the **AMSTERDAM** Region.
5. Set the bucket visibility to **Private**.
6. Click **Create Bucket**.

## Activating Messaging and Queuing SQS

Message queues allow functions to communicate with each other.

1. Click **Messaging** under **Serverless** on the left side menu of the console.
2. Click **Activate** next to **SQS**.
3. Click **Activate SQS** to confirm when prompted.

## Generating credentials for Messaging and Queuing SQS

1. Click **Messaging** under **Serverless** on the left side menu of the console, then select **SQS**.
2. Click **+ Generate credentials**.
3. Name your credentials `Function Push`.
4. Enable the **Write**, **Read** and **Manage** permissions.
5. Click **Generate credentials**.
6. Store the access key ID and the secret key securely, as you will not be able to access them later.

## Creating a Queue

1. Click **Messaging** under **Serverless** on the left side menu of the console, then select **SQS**.
2. Click **Create queue**.
3. Select **Standard** as a queue type.
4. Name it `image-queue`. 
5. Keep the default parameters.
6. Click **Create queue**.

## Creating IAM credentials

Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials allow you to secure access to your buckets, functions, etc. 

<Message type="note">
    For this tutorial we will use *User* credentials which are simpler to use. However, for production-grade Serverless applications, we recommend to use *Application* credentials with the minimum possible rights.

1. Click the Organization in the top right corner and Select **API keys**. The IAM **API keys** tab displays.
2. Click **+ Generate an API key** or the <Icon name="plus" /> button.
3. Select **Myself (IAM)** as the API key Bearer.
4. Enter `API key for the Function Tutorial` as a description.
5. Set **Expiration** to **One Week**.
6. Select **Yes, set up preferred Project**.
7. Choose the **Functions Tutorial** project (or the name you gave to this project).
8. Click **Generate API key**.
9. Store the Access key ID and the Secret key securely, as you will not be able to access them later.

## Enabling monitoring with Cockpit

1. Click **Cockpit** under **Observability**.
2. Click the **Grafana users** tab.
3. Click **+ Add user**.
4. Enter a username.
5. Select the **Editor** role.
6. Click **Add user**.
7. Store the password securely, as you will not be able to access it later.

## Creating and deploying functions

You have created all the necessary resources, it is now time to [create functions](/tutorials/transform-bucket-images-triggers-functions-deploy/).

<Message type="tip">
Setting up an environment with all the necessary resources can be time-consuming. You can use IaC (Infrastructure as Code) tools such as [Terraform](/tutorials/manage-instances-with-terraform-and-functions/) to automate a project's configuration.
