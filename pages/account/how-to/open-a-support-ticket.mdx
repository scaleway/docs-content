Scaleway provides 24/7 basic technical support by ticket for free. You can contact our support team directly from the console. You can also [upgrade your support level](/account/how-to/configure-support-plans/) to benefit from phone support and a dedicated account manager.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)

## How to open a support ticket

1. Click the question mark icon on the Scaleway console header menu. The [Help Center](https://console.scaleway.com/support) displays.
2. Click **Open a support ticket**, under **Contact us**.
3. Fill out the required fields. [See what information to include to obtain faster responses]
4. Attach any supporting files that may help our team identify and solve your issue.
5. Click **Submit ticket**.

## Required information

The information below must be included in your support ticket, allowing our team to identify the issues you are facing.

- **Product**: choose the product related to your issue from the available options, such as Instances and Elastic Metal. If your ticket is a general inquiry and does not concern a product, select **Other**.

- **Related resource**: choose the affected resource, such as a specific Instance or volume.

- **Priority**: select the impact the issue has on your infrastructure. Refer to the table below to understand priority levels.


| **Priority** | **Description**              | **Example**                                                                             |
|--------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **P1**       | Service down                 | Your infrastructure is not working in production, and no workaround is available.       |
| **P2**       | Partial service outage       | Your infrastructure is partly functional but facing critical errors with no workaround. |
| **P3**       | Severely degraded service    | The service is slow or highly degraded, but a temporary workaround is possible.         |
| **P4**       | Minor incidents              | The service is running with minor issues that do not impact your activity.              |
| **P5**       | General question or request  | You have a question or need information, but there is no technical issue.               |


- **Subject**: write a short and clear title that summarizes the issue, e.g., _"Instance does not start after an update"_ or _"API call returns 500 error for all requests"_.

- **Description**: include a detailed description to help us resolve the issue.

## What to include in a ticket for a quick resolution

Providing clear and detailed information about the problems you are facing helps us quickly identify their causes. Follow our recommendations below to avoid unnecessary exchanges and reduce your ticket resolution time.

### Clearly describe the issue
- **Context:** explain when and where the problem occurs.
E.g., _“I get an error when trying to start an Instance after applying a configuration update in the Scaleway console”._

- **Expected behavior:** explain what was expected to happen.
E.g., _“The Instance should start within 2 minutes without errors”._

- **Actual behavior:** describe what is happening instead.
E.g., _“The Instance was stuck in a 'Starting' status for over 10 minutes, then switched to an 'Error' status and became unavailable"._

### Include relevant technical details

- **Environment information:** mention your operating system, tools, or SDKs, e.g., “Ubuntu 20.04, Scaleway API v2, Python SDK".

- **Logs or error messages:** include any logs, request/response payloads, or error codes, e.g., “API call GET /instances returns 500 Internal Server Error”.

### Attach supporting files

If possible, upload files that may help us understand your issue. You can include screenshots, PDFs, and text files.
  <Message type="important">
    Keep in mind that:
      - You can attach up to 4 files per message and 10 files per ticket.
      - The size of each file cannot exceed 10 MB
      - The following file formats are supported: `jpeg`, `jpg`, `png`, `pdf`, and `txt`.
      - The uploaded data is exclusively intended to provide you with support in the use of Scaleway services. Do not transmit inappropriate or irrelevant sensitive data.
