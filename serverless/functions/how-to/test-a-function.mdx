This page shows you how to execute Serverless Functions from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com). The **Test** feature of a function allows you to run your code using a selection of methods to make sure it behaves as expected.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a function](/serverless/functions/how-to/create-a-function/)

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.

2. Click the relevant functions namespace. A list of your functions displays.

3. Click the name of the function you want to test.

4. Open the **Test** tab.

5. Select the **method** you want to use from the drop-down menu.

6. Enter the **path** to your function. Leave the default `/` value if your function is not located in a specific folder within a [Zip package](/serverless/functions/how-to/package-function-dependencies-in-zip/).

7. Click **+ Advanced options** to add any required HTTP header or parameter to your function.

8. Click **Run**.

The **Output** section displays the response from your function and the status code.
