## Default Project

Each [Organization](#organization) has at least one associated [Project](#project). Upon account creation, this Project is called **default**. The default Project takes on the Organization ID. Therefore, the default status cannot be transferred to other Projects, nor can the default Project's name be altered.

## Project

A Project is a grouping of Scaleway [resources](#resource). Each Scaleway Organization comes with a default Project, and you can create new Projects if necessary. Projects are cross-region, meaning resources located in different [regions](/compute/instances/concepts/#region) can be grouped in one single Project. When grouping resources into different Projects, you can use [IAM](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#iam) to define custom access rights for each Project.

## Project Dashboard

The Project Dashboard can be viewed within the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/project). On this dashboard, you can see an overview of the Project's [resources](#resources), along with the Project's settings and credentials ([SSH keys](#ssh-key)).

## Resource

A Scaleway resource is either a product or a feature in the Scaleway Ecosystem. Examples of resources include Instances, Private Networks, Kubernetes Kapsule and Flexible IPs, to name a few.

## SSH key

An SSH key (**S**ecure **Sh**ell key) allows passwordless connection to an [Instance](/compute/instances/concepts/#instance). An SSH key is generated by creating an RSA key pair, consisting of two elements:

- a sensitive **identification key**, (aka private key) which must be stored securely
- a **public key**, which is uploaded to the Scaleway interface.

The public key is kept in your Scaleway account and transferred to the Instance during the boot process, while the identification key is kept securely on your local computer. When connecting to the Instance via SSH, a trusted connection to the machine is established using the key pair.
