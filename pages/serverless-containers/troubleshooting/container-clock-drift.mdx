## Problem

The clock of my Serverless Container is slowly drifting.

## Cause

The internal clock of a Serverless Container executed in a [Sandbox v1](/serverless-containers/reference-content/containers-sandbox/) environment is known to slowly drift over time, to reach a clock skew of approximately **two seconds** after 24 hours.

## Solution

[Update the sandbox environment](/serverless-containers/how-to/manage-a-container/#how-to-manage-a-container-deployment) of your Serverless Container to [Sandbox v2](/serverless-containers/reference-content/containers-sandbox/#sandbox-v2) to solve clock drift issues.
