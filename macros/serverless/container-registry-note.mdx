[Scaleway's Container Registry](/containers/container-registry/) allows for a seamless integration with Serverless Containers and Jobs at a [competitive price](/faq/containerregistry/#how-am-i-billed-for-scaleway-container-registry). 
Serverless products support external public registries (such as [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=)), but we do not recommend using them due to uncontrolled rate limiting, which can lead to failures when starting resources, unexpected usage conditions, and pricing changes.
