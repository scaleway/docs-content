This page shows you how to create and manage an authentication token from the console.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created a containers namespace](/serverless/containers/how-to/create-a-containers-namespace)
  - You have [deployed a container](/serverless/containers/how-to/deploy-a-container-from-scaleway-container-registry/)

</Message>

## Creating authentication tokens from the Scaleway console

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The Serverless Containers page displays.

2. Click the relevant containers namespace to see a list of containers in this namespace.

3. Click the name of the relevant container in the **Containers** tab. The container's details display. 

4. Click the **Containers Settings** tab. A list of your containers settings displays. 

5. Click **Generate token** in the **Tokens** panel. A pop-up displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-container-generate-token.webp" alt="" />

6. Enter the token description and set an expiration date for the token. Optionally, tick the box **No expiration date**, to have a token with unlimited validity. Then click **Generate token**.

7. Copy the token from the pop-up and store it in a safe environment. 

    <Message type="important">

    The token key will only be available for copy once. Make sure to store it securely before leaving the page.

## Using tokens

To use your token, you have to add the generated token to a `x-auth-token`-header.

A **private** container observes this behaviour:

* If a call is made without the` x-auth-token`-header, the call is rejected (status code 403)
* If the `x-auth-token`-header is provided, the token is validated using a public key attached to the namespace.

For example, to execute a private container by providing a JWT using `curl`, you may run the following command:
```
curl -H "X-AUTH-TOKEN: <generated-token>" <your-container-host>
```

## Deleting tokens

Tokens will expire by default on their given expiry date. You can delete them manually if they are no longer needed. 

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The Serverless Containers page displays.

2. Click the relevant containers namespace to see a list of containers in this namespace.

3. Click the name of the relevant container in the **Containers** tab. The container's details display. 

4. Click the **Security** tab. A list of your containers settings displays. 

5. Click <Icon name="delete" /> in the **Tokens** panel. A pop-up displays.

6. Confirm by clicking **Delete token** to delete the token and to revoke access to the container. 

    <Message type="important">

    This action is irreversible and this token will not be able to access your container anymore.
