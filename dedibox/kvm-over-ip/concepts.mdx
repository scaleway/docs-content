## KVM Over IP

KVM Over IP is a hardware-based solution that enables remote access to the **k**eyboard, **v**ideo (screen) and **m**ouse ports of a physical server. A unit plugs into these ports, and transmits their signals to a connected user through a network. This allows access to the machine even if the installed OS is not working properly, and opens up possibilities for debugging and more.

## ISO file

An ISO file, also called ISO image, is an archive file that contains an identical copy of data stored usually on a physical optical disk, such as a CD or DVD. The name ISO file comes from the file system type used by optical media (usually ISO 9660). The ISO file can be distributed to be burned on an phyiscal disc or can be read directly by most operating systems or [KVM over IP](#kvm-over-ip) devices to install a operating system on a remote machine.
