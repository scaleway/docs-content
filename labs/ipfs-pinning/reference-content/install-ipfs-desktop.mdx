With Scaleway IPFS Pinning, you can permanently store your data on the public IPFS network. You can either [create](/labs/ipfs-pinning/api-cli/volumes-operations/) and manage your volume via the [Kubo client](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/command-line/) or through [IPFS Desktop](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop/).

This article shows you how to add Scaleway as your remote pinning service using IPFS Desktop.
