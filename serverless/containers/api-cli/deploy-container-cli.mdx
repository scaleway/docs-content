## Scaleway Command Line Interface Overview

[The Scaleway Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli) allows you to pilot your Scaleway infrastructure directly from your terminal, providing a faster way to administer and monitor your resources. Scaleway CLI is easy to set up and use, and an essential tool for operating efficiently in your cloud environment. The CLI provides many functionalities, including the ability to create and deploy Serverless Containers.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your SSH key](/console/project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
  - You have [generated your API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
  - You have [downloaded and installed the Scaleway CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli)
</Message>

## Configuring the CLI

1. Open a terminal and type the following command to configure the Scaleway CLI on your machine:

    ```bash
    scw init
    ```

    If you have already configured the CLI, you will see a message like the following:

    ```
    Current config is located at /path/to/config.yaml
    access_key: your-access-key
    secret_key: your-secret-key
    default_organization_id: ID-of-your-organization
    default_project_id: ID-of-your-project
    default_region: your-default-region (fr-par)
    default_zone: your-default-zone (fr-par-1)

    Do you want to override the current config? (Y/n):
    ```

2. Type `n` and go directly to the [Creating a container](#creating-a-container) step of this procedure if you do not want to edit your configuration.

    If you have not yet configured the CLI, you will be guided through the configuration process via a series of questions:

    ```
    Enter a valid secret-key or an email
    ```

3. Enter either the email address for your account (you will then be asked for your password), or your [API secret key](/console/project/how-to/create-ssh-key):

    ```
    To improve this tool we rely on diagnostic and usage data.
    Sending such data is optional and can be disabled at any time by running "scw config set send-telemetry=false".
    Do you want to send usage statistics and diagnostics? (Y/n):
    ```

    Type `y` or `n`.

    ```
    To fully enjoy Scaleway CLI we recommend you install autocomplete support in your shell.
    Do you want to install autocomplete? (Y/n):
    ```

    Type `y` or `n`.

    ```
    To enable autocomplete, scw needs to update your shell configuration.
    What type of shell are you using (default: zsh):
    ```

4. Press enter if the default shell type displayed is the one you are using. Otherwise, enter the correct shell type you are using. This should complete the configuration process:

    ```
    Initialization completed with success.
    ```

## Creating a container

1. Run the following command in your terminal to create a containers namespace:

    ```bash
    scw container namespace create name=<YOUR_NAMESPACE_NAME>
    ```

    An output similar to the following displays:
    
    ```
    ID                   6e74dbb7-9323-46bb-abc7-5c0105f4e70e
    Name                 <YOUR_NAMESPACE_NAME>
    OrganizationID       55e28409-776f-4f65-a41e-6c5fc58b4076
    ProjectID            55e28409-776f-4f65-a41e-6c5fc58b4076
    Status               pending
    RegistryNamespaceID  -
    RegistryEndpoint     -
    Description          -
    Region               fr-par
    ```

2. Run the following command in your terminal to create a container:

    ```bash
    scw container container create name=<CONTAINER_NAME> namespace-id=<NAMESPACE_ID> registry-image=<IMAGE_REGISTRY_URL>
    ```

    An output similar to the following displays:

    ```
    ID              717fb5f9-95c3-4c0b-84db-2321283e46dc
    Name            <CONTAINER_NAME>
    NamespaceID     cee31af8-d43e-4078-8f55-c921a9311f47
    Status          created
    MinScale        0
    MaxScale        5
    Runtime         python310
    MemoryLimit     256
    CPULimit        140

    RuntimeMessage  -
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      For testing purposes, you can use the `registry-image=nginx:latest` and `port=80` parameters to quickly create a container.
    </Message>

## Deploying a container

1. Run the following command to deploy your container with the zip archive you just created:

    ```bash
    scw container container deploy <CONTAINER_ID>
    ```

    The deployment process can take several minutes, depending on the image used.

2. Run the following command to call your container:

    ```bash
    curl <YOUR_CONTAINER_ENDPOINT>
    ```

    Your container is now deployed and ready to be used.
