<Message type="important">
The **Allowed IPs** feature via ACLs is no longer available for Managed Inference deployments. We recommended using one of the alternative methods detailed in this document to restrict access to your Managed Inference deployments.
</Message>

You can manage and restrict access to your Managed Inference deployments via the following methods:

- Use [IAM](/iam/) features to place conditions on the API keys that are accepted when accessing your deployment's public endpoint
- Remove your deployment's public endpoint, and allow controlled access only via Private Networks.

Read on for full details of these two methods.

<Requirements />

  - A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - A [Managed Inference deployment](/managed-inference/quickstart/)
  - [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to manage public access to a deployment with IAM

When you enable a public endpoint for your Managed Inference deployment, access to this endpoint is restricted by default: a valid [Scaleway API key](/iam/concepts/#api-key) must accompany all access requests.

An API key is considered valid to access a deployment when:

- It belongs to the [Owner](TODO) of the Organization which owns the deployment, or
- It belongs to a [Member](TODO) or [Application](TODO) of the Organization which owns the deployment, and the Member/Application has appropriate [IAM permissions](/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/).

There are two IAM permission sets specific to Managed Inference deployments: `InferenceFullAccess` (allowing access to create, read, update and delete a deployment) and `InferenceReadOnly` (allowing read-only access). Alternatively, wide-scoped permission sets such as `AllProductsFullAccess` will also allow access.

Permissions are attributed via [policies](TODO), which are then attached to a Member or Application. 

You can further restrict access by imposing **conditions** when defining a policy. This enables you to allow access only to authorized API keys when presented by specific user agents (e.g., Terraform), from certain IP addresses, or during defined dates and times.

### How to manage deployment access as an Organization Owner or Administrator

<Message type="note">
If you only want to access the deployment yourself, and you are Owner of the Organization that created the deployment, all you need to do is [generate an API key]() for yourself, and it will automatically have full rights to access and manage the deployment.

Read on if you want to manage access to your deployment for others.

1. [Invite Members]() (humans) to your Organization, or [create Applications]() (non-human users).
2. Create and attach a [policy]() to the Member or Application, defining the permissions they should have in your Organization by selelcting permission sets e.g. `InferenceFullAccess`. If desired, define [conditions]() as part of the policy, to further restrict access based on user agent type, date/time or IP address.

All API keys generated by the Member, or for the Application, will automatically inherit the permissions you defined, and can be used to access a Managed Inference deployment's public endpoint depending on those permissions.

You can revoke access to a deployment at any time by [modifying the policy]() attached to the Member or Application in question.

### How to access a deployment as an Organization Member

Access to Managed Inference deployments owned by an Organization in which you are a Member, is dependant on the IAM permissions attributed to you by the Organization's Owner or administrators.

Your permissions will be automatically applied to any API keys you generate for yourself in the Scaleway console. Check with your Organiaztion Owner if you are unsure that you have the right permissions to access a Managed Inference deployment.

1. [Log into the Scaleway console]() and [generate an API key for yourself]()
2. Use this API key for authentication when sending requests to a Managed Inference deployment.
