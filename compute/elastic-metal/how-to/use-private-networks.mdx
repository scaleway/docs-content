Private Networks allow your Elastic Metal servers to communicate with other Scaleway resources in an isolated and secure network, without the need of being connected to the public Internet. This is an optional billed feature, available with our Elastic Metal server ranges.

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance)

## How to enable and disable the Private Networks feature

The Private Networks feature must be enabled on a per-server basis. Note that [only Aluminium, Beryllium and Lithium Elastic Metal servers are compatible with Private Networks](https://www.scaleway.com/en/elastic-metal/).

You can enable/disable Private Networks on compatible Elastic Metal servers either during creation of the server, or afterwards.

### During the creation of your Elastic Metal server

You can choose to enable the Private Networks feature during the [creation of your Elastic Metal server](/compute/elastic-metal/how-to/create-server). Simply use the toggle icon <Icon name="toggle" /> when prompted by the creation wizard to enable the feature. If you do not enable the feature, it remains disabled by default.

### After the creation of your Elastic Metal server

1. Navigate to the **Elastic Metal servers** page of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/elastic-metal/servers). A list of your Elastic Metal servers displays.

2. Click the server for which you want to enable/disable the Private Networks feature. The server's **Overview** page displays.

3. Scroll to the **Private Networks feature** panel.

4. Click **Enable** or **Disable** to enable/disable the Private Networks feature as required.

5. Confirm the action when prompted.

<Message type="note">

Private Networks for Elastic Metal servers is a billable feature, and will be billed hourly or monthly depending on the type of Elastic Metal server you chose. If your Elastic Metal server is billed monthly and you disable the Private Networks feature after previously enabling it, you will still be billed for the feature for the current calendar month.

## How to attach and detach Elastic Metal servers to a Private Network

You can attach/detach Elastic Metal servers to a Private Network from either the Elastic Metal section of the console, or the Private Networks section.

### From the Elastic Metal section of the console

1. Navigate to the **Elastic Metal** page of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/elastic-metal/servers). A list of your Elastic Metal servers displays.

2. Click the server you want to attach/detach from a Private Network.

3. Click the **Private Networks** tab.

4. Click **Attach a Private Network** and continue to step 5. Otherwise, to detach your server from a Private Network, click the <Icon type="unlink" /> icon next to the Private Network and confirm the action when prompted.

5. Either:

    - Select **Attach an existing Private Network**, and choose a network from the dropdown list to attach your server to. Remember, only Private Networks in the same Availability Zone as your server will be displayed, you cannot attach a server to a Private Network from another Availability Zone.
    - Select **Attach a new Private Network**, and enter a name for the new Private Network you wish to create.

6. Click **Attach a Private Network** to confirm.

### From the Private Networks section of the console

See our dedicated documentation [how to attach and detach resources to/from a Private Network](/network/vpc/how-to/use-private-networks/#how-to-attach-and-detach-resources-tofrom-a-private-network).

## How to configure the network interface on your Elastic Metal server for Private Networks

You must configure the virtual network interface on each Elastic Metal server you have added to a Private Network. Traffic from the public Internet and traffic from a Private Network will pass through the same network interface of the Elastic Metal server. We must therefore separate the traffic by adding a VLAN interface.

<Message type="important">

The following commands show how to configure the network interface on an Elastic Metal server running Ubuntu. For other operating systems, check the distributor's documentation.

</Message>

1. Make a note of your Elastic Metal server's VLAN ID. You can view this in the **Private Networks** tab of the Elastic Metal server in question.

2. [Connect to your Elastic Metal server via SSH](/compute/elastic-metal/how-to/connect-to-server/).

3. Find the network interface using the `ip link show` command:

  ```bash
  ip link show
  ```

  The output will vary depending on the server, but here is an example:

  ```
  1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
  2: eno1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
      link/ether 9c:b6:54:bb:6c:64 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
  3: eno2: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
      link/ether 9c:b6:54:bb:6c:65 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
  ```

  In this case, the network interface is identified by `eno1`.

4. Enter the following command to add a virtual link to the network interface. Replace `1234` with the VLAN ID you noted down in step 1 and `eno1` (if necessary) with the relevant network interface name identified in step 3.

  ```bash
  sudo ip link add link eno1 name eno1.1234 type vlan id 1234
  ```

5. Enter the following command to bring up the virtual link. Make the necessary replacements for `eno1` and `1234` as you did previously.

  ```
  sudo ip link set eno1.1234 up
  ```

6. Enter the following command to assign an IP address. Make the necessary replacements for `eno1` and `1234` as you did previously. [See here for advice on choosing an IP address](/compute/instances/how-to/use-private-networks/#how-to-configure-the-private-network-interface-on-your-instances).

  ```bash
  sudo ip addr add 10.10.10.10/24 dev eno1.1234
  ```

## How to configure the Private Network on Windows Server 2019

1. Log into your server as `Administrateur` using the Remote Desktop client.

  <Message type="note">

  The default language of Windows Server installations is French. Make sure to use the user `Administrateur` when connecting to your server. If required you can [change the language of the operating system](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/change-win-server-language).

  </Message>

2. Launch the **Server Manager** application.

3. Click **Local Server** in the menu on the left. Then click **NIC Teaming** in the **Properties** section.

4. Click **Tasks** > **New Team**. Enter a team name of your choice (e.g. `default`) and tick the checkbox **NIC1**. Then click **OK**.

5. Select the **Team interfaces** tab in the **Adapters and Interfaces** section. Click **Tasks** > **Add interface**. A pop-up displays.

6. Enter a name for the new interface (e.g. `default - VLAN 1234` if your VLAN ID is 1234). Select **Specific VLAN** and enter the ID of your VLAN (e.g. 1234). Click **OK** to confirm.

  <Message type="important">

  Two network interfaces display: Your VLAN and `default`. Make sure to keep the default network as you will lose access to your server via the public Internet otherwise.

  </Message>

7. Click **Start** > **Execute** and tpye `ncpa.cpl`. Then click **OK** to open the network connection manager.

8. Click on your VLAN network connection and right-click on it to open the menu. Click **Properties** to display the connection properties. 

9. Select **Internet Protocol version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** and click **Properties**. A pop-up displays.

10. Click **Use the following IP address** and configure the IPv4 configuration of your Private Network. Then click **OK** to save your configuration and to close the window.

11. Click **Close** to close the network interface properties. 

You completed the configuration of your Private Network on Windows Server 2019. 

  <Message type="tip">

  You can use the `ipconfig` command to verify your IP configuration from a command prompt.

## How to test your Private Network configuration

See our [instructions for testing an Instance Private Network configuration](/compute/instances/how-to/use-private-networks/#how-to-test-your-private-network-configuration).

## How to delete a Private Network

<Message type="note">

Prior to deleting a Private Network, all resources attached to the network must be detached.
