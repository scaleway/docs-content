With the release of VPC in GA, the Public Gateway is no longer supporting the DHCP server.
The Public Gateway focuses now on its primary function such as
- Internet access: Allowing external traffic to access the internal resources of a Private Network
- NAT-Gateway: Distributing request to the right IP address
- SSH Bastion: Allowing and monitoring SSH connection
- Local DNS server: customizing resources name on the Private Network
