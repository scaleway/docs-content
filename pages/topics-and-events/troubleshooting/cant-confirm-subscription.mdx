## I'm having trouble confirming a subscription to a topic

When you create an HTTP or HTTPS subscription to a topic, this subscription will have a `Pending` status until you **confirm** it. This is essential to start receiving messages.

## Problem: You don't know how to confirm the subscription

Ensure you have followed the steps outlined on our [dedicated how-to page](/topics-and-events/how-to/create-manage-subscriptions/#how-to-confirm-an-http-or-https-subscription) for confirming a subscription. You must retrieve the message Scaleway sent to your endpoint, and provide us with the `SubscribeURL` to confirm the subscription.

## Problem: No message received from Scaleway to confirm the subscription

You may find that you are not receiving the expected message from Scaleway (delivered as an HTTP POST request) sent to confirm the subscription.

The Scaleway POST request may not include an `ORIGIN` header. Ensure that your framework can receive a message without an origin header without triggering a 403 error, and retry.
