SSH keys offer a more secure method of identity authentication on computer systems compared to passwords. Each SSH key comprises a private and a public part, which can be generated on your computer. The public part serves the purpose of passwordless authentication and can be uploaded to the Scaleway Dedibox console and then transferred to your dedicated server during installation.

<Requirements />
- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)


1. In the top right corner of the Dedibox console, click on your username to open the pop-up menu. From there, select **SSH keys**.

    You will be taken to a page displaying all your existing SSH keys (if you have not created any key yet, the list will be empty).
2. Click **Add SSH key** to open the SSH key form.
3. Provide a description of your choice (e.g., your computer's name) and paste the public key into the designated field.
4. Click **Add SSH key** to upload the public key to your Scaleway Dedibox account.

    With the SSH key now uploaded, you can select it during the [Dedibox installation process](/dedibox/how-to/install-a-server/) and use it for authentication on your server.
  <Message type="note">
    If you upload another key or change the existing one, you must manually replace it on your Dedibox. The **keys are transferred from the console to your server solely during installation**.
