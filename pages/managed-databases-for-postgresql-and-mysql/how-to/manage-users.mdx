Users can connect to a database and access its data. Each one has a different set of customizable permissions.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [PostgreSQL or MySQL Database Instance](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/quickstart/)

## How to create a user

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Select the geographical region of the Instance you want to manage from the drop-down.
3. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
4. Go to the **Users** tab. A list of users displays. If it is the first time you create a user, your list will display the user you set up during the creation of your Database Instance.
5. Click **+ Create user** to create a new user, if you wish to.
6. Click <Icon name="toggle" /> to grant admin rights to the user.
    <Message type="note">
      Admin rights allow a user to create logical databases and users. These right do not override the permissions configured for the logical databases. Logical database permissions must be set up in the Permissions tab.
    </Message>
7. Enter a **username** and **password**.
    <Message type="note">
      Optionally, you can configure the appropriate permissions according to the user.
      Three types of permissions are available:
        - **None:** No access to the database,
        - **Read:** Allow users to read tables and fields in a database,
        - **Write:** Allow users to write content in databases.
      You can select the permission type in the Permissions tab.

    </Message>

    <Message type="important">
      PostgreSQL Permissions are applied to existing items **at the moment the configuration is set**. They cannot be applied to any items created afterward.
      When you add database objects like tables or sequences, your configured permissions are automatically set to **Custom**. The **Custom** setting ensures that your permissions are still valid for items created before you reconfigured your Database.
      You can use [PostgreSQL default privileges](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-alterdefaultprivileges.html) to set default privileges for future objects.
    </Message>
8. Click **Create user** to confirm.

    Once the user is created, it is displayed in the user list.

To update the password, the permissions or delete the user, click <Icon name="more" /> to display the respective options.

## Set permissions for an existing user

Permissions define the actions a user can perform on a logical database. A database user is automatically generated when you create your Database Instance, to whom the permissions are attributed. However, newly created users have no permissions by default.

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Select the geographical region of the Instance you want to manage from the drop-down.
3. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
4. Go to the **Users** tab. A list of users displays.
5. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Update permissions** to open the user permissions panel.
6. Select the appropriate permissions for each database.
    <Message type="note">
      Three types of permissions are available:
        - **None:** No access to the database
        - **Read:** Allow users to read tables and fields in a database
        - **Read/Write:** Allow users to read/write content in databases
        - **All:** Allows the creation of schemas and tables.
    </Message>
7. Click **Update user** to confirm.
