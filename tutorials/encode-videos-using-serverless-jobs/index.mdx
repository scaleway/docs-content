This tutorial demonstrates the process of encoding videos retrieved from Object Storage using Serverless Jobs: media encoding is a resource-intensive task over prolonged durations, making it suitable for Serverless Jobs. The job takes a video file as its input, encodes it using a Docker image based on [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/), then uploads the encoded video back to the S3 bucket.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/) 
- A valid [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
- Installed [Docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)


## Creating the job image

The initial step involves defining a Docker image for interacting with the S3 Object Storage using [MinIO](https://min.io/) and performing a video encoding task using [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/).

1. Create a bash script `encode.sh` with the following content:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/sh
    set -e

    echo "Configuring S3 access for MinIO"
    mc config host add scw "https://$JOB_S3_ENDPOINT/" "$JOB_S3_ACCESS_KEY" "$JOB_S3_SECRET_KEY"

    echo "Downloading the file from S3"
    mc cp "scw/$JOB_INPUT_PATH/$JOB_INPUT_FILENAME" "/tmp/$JOB_INPUT_FILENAME"

    echo "Encoding the file"
    ffmpeg -i "/tmp/$JOB_INPUT_FILENAME" -vcodec libx264 -acodec aac "/tmp/$JOB_OUTPUT_FILENAME"

    echo "Uploading the encoded file to the S3"
    mc cp "/tmp/$JOB_OUTPUT_FILENAME" "scw/$JOB_OUTPUT_PATH/$JOB_OUTPUT_FILENAME"
    ```

    That bash script downloads a video from an S3 bucket, encodes that video using FFMPEG, and then uploads the encoded video into the bucket, by leveraging a couple of environment variables which will be detailed in the following sections.

    <Message type="note">
    For illustration purposes, this script encodes a video using the x264 video codec and the AAC audio codec. Encoding settings can be modified using command-line parameters to FFMPEG.
    </Message>

2. Use that script as an entrypoint for a new Docker image, by creating the following Dockerfile:
    ```dockerfile
    FROM linuxserver/ffmpeg:amd64-latest

    # Install the MinIO S3 client
    RUN curl https://dl.min.io/client/mc/release/linux-amd64/mc -o /usr/local/bin/mc
    RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mc

    # Define the image entrypoint
    COPY encode.sh /encode.sh
    RUN chmod +x /encode.sh

    ENTRYPOINT /encode.sh
    ```

    This Dockerfile uses `linuxserver/ffmpeg` as a base image bundled with FFMPEG along with a variety of encoding codecs and installs [MinIO](https://min.io/) as a command-line S3 client to copy files over Object Storage.

3. Build and [push the image](/containers/container-registry/how-to/push-images/) to your Container Registry:
    ```
    docker build . -t <registry and image name>
    docker push <registry and image name>
    ```

    You can find the name and endpoint of your Container Registry from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/registry/namespaces/)

## Creating the serverless job

1. In the Scaleway Console, click **Jobs** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu, then **Create job** to display the job creation wizard.

2. Select the **Scaleway** Container Registry and your Container Registry namespace from the drop-down list, then select the image from the previous section.

3. Choose your job name, description, and region. In the **Resources** section, pick a reasonable amount of resources.
    <Message type="note">
    The allocated CPU defines the speed of the encoding process. The allocated memory depends on the encoding codec and bitrate. For instance, encoding a Full HD video with the x264 codec takes about 3 GB of memory.
    </Message>

4. Toggle the **Advanced options** section and add 3 environment variables:
    - `JOB_S3_ENDPOINT` is your S3 endpoint (e.g. `s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud`).
    - `JOB_S3_ACCESS_KEY` is your API access key.
    - `JOB_S3_SECRET_KEY` is your API secret key.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-encoding_job_env.webp" alt="" />

5. Leave the other sections empty, then click `Create job`.

## Triggering the serverless job

Ensure that your S3 bucket contains at least one video that can be encoded.

1. In the Scaleway Console, go to **Serverless Jobs** and click on the name of your job. The job **Overview** tab displays.
2. Click the **Actions** button, then click **Run job with options** in the drop-down menu.
3. Add 4 environment variables:
    - `JOB_INPUT_PATH` is the folder containing the video to encode, including your S3 bucket name.
    - `JOB_INPUT_FILENAME` is the file name of the video to encode, including the file extension.
    - `JOB_OUTPUT_PATH` is the folder containing the encoded video that will be uploaded, including your S3 bucket name.
    - `JOB_OUTPUT_FILENAME` is the file name of the encoded video that will be uploaded.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-encoding_run_env.webp" alt="" />

4. Click **Run job**.

The progress and details for your Job run can be viewed in the **Job runs** section of the job **Overview** tab in the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/). You can also access the detailed logs of your job in [Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/quickstart/).

Once the run status is **Succeeded**, the encoded video can be found in your S3 bucket under the folder and file name specified above in the environment variables.

<Message type="note">
Your job can also be triggered through the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-jobs/#path-job-definitions-run-an-existing-job-definition-by-its-unique-identifier-this-will-create-a-new-job-run/) using the same environment variables:

```
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-Auth-Token: <API Key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "environment_variables": { "JOB_INPUT_FILENAME": "...", "JOB_INPUT_PATH" : "...", "JOB_OUTPUT_FILENAME" : "...", "JOB_OUTPUT_PATH" : "..." } }' \
  "https://api.scaleway.com/serverless-jobs/v1alpha1/regions/<Region>/job-definitions/<Job ID>/start"
