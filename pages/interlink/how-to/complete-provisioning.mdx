<Message type="important">
InterLink is currently in [Private Beta](https://www.scaleway.com/en/betas/), and only available to selected testers.
</Message>

After you have [ordered your InterLink](/interlink/how-to/order-interlink), further action is required on both the customer side and the [partner](/interlink/concepts/#partner) side before the InterLink is provisioned and ready for active use. This page walks you through the steps to take and how to deal with potential problems that could arise.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-interlink-ordering.webp" alt="A four step flow chart shows the following steps: 1. User orders InterLink via Scaleway, 2. User requests InterLink from partner, 3. Partner accepts InterLink request, 4. Partner provisions InterLink." />

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Ordered an InterLink](/interlink/how-to/order-interlink)

## Contact partner to request InterLink

After ordering the InterLink from Scaleway, you **must** contact your chosen partner to request that they provision the connection on their side. Scaleway is not able to automatically do this step for you.

1. Click **InterLink** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. A listing of your InterLinks displays.

2. Click on the InterLink that you want to finish provisioning. The InterLink's **Overview** page displays.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-interlink-overview-requesting.webp" alt="A screen in the Scaleway console show's an overview of an InterLink's partner, location, region, bandwidth, creation date, pairing key, and IPv4/IPv6 connectivity status." />

3. Note down the [pairing key](/interlink/concepts/#pairing-key) for your InterLink. This is a unique identification number which the partner will need in order to provision your InterLink.

4. Contact your partner. After [creating your InterLink order](/interlink/how-to/order-interlink/), either their online portal URL, or their email address was displayed to you for this purpose. Use the relevant method to contact your partner, provide the pairing key, and request that they provision your InterLink from their side.

You can also use the [Get a partner](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/interlink/#path-partners-get-a-partner) endpoint in the API to get contact details and other information about your selected partner.

Your InterLink will remain in `Requested` status until the partner responds to your request.

## Wait for partner to accept InterLink request

Once you have requested the InterLink  from your partner, you must wait for them to respond to your request. There is no further action for you to take at this point. You can keep track of your InterLink's [status](/interlink/reference-content/statuses/) via the [InterLink listing](https://console.scaleway.com/interlink/links) in the Scaleway console.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-interlink-listing.webp" alt="A screen in the Scaleway console shows a listing of InterLinks, with the following information: name, status, partner, location, region and bandwidth." />

When the partner approves your request, the InterLink moves to `Provisioning` status. This means that the partner has agreed to facilitate your InterLink, and is now preparing the resources and configuration necessary to establish the physical connection. 

Your InterLink will remain in `Provisioning` status until this process has been completed.

<Message type="important">
If your InterLink does not move to `Provisioning` status, you may see one of the following statuses:

- `Refused`: The partner did not agree to provision your InterLink. Delete this InterLink resource, and contact your partner for more information. Consider re-ordering with a different partner.
- `Expired`: Your InterLink order timed out: after 10 days, no response was received from the selected partner. Delete the InterLink resource, and create a new order if you wish to try again.
</Message>

## Partner provisions InterLink

When the partner has finished provisioning your InterLink, it moves to `Active` status. This indicates that the physical link and necessary accompanying configuration has been completed on the partner's side, and your InterLink is ready for use.

You must still configure your InterLink by attaching it to a VPC, attaching an allowed routes list, and activating route propagation, before traffic can flow over the InterLink. For help with these steps, see our documentation on [How to configure your InterLink](/interlink/reference-content/configuring/).

<Message type="important">
If you see a `Limited connectivity` status next to your InterLink on the [listing page](https://console.scaleway.com/interlink/links), this indicates that the partner provisioned your InterLink, but either IPv4 or IPv6 connectivity is down. Similarly, a `Down` status indicates the InterLink is provisioned, but both IPv4 **and** IPv6 connectivity are down. Open a Scaleway support ticket, or contact your partner for assistance.

A `Locked` status indicates, again, that the InterLink was provisioned, but Scaleway Trust and Safety have locked the resource. No actions are possible from you as a user: you should open a support ticket for help and information.
