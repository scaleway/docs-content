Your RPNv1 gateway may differ from one Dedibox to another for techical reasons.
It is normally pushed by DHCP, and and configured automatically.
However, in some cases you may need to know the details of the gateway.

<Message type="requirement">

* You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net)
* You have a Dedibox dedicated server with RPN interface

</Message>

You can find the RPNv1 gateway for your Dedibox in [rescue mode](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/use-rescue-mode/) by typing:

```
# ip route show
10.90.0.0/XX via X.X.X.X ...
```

If you do not know your RPN netmask, you can find it by using IPCALC. The gateway is always the first IP of the subnet.
```
# ipcalc -b [SET_HERE_YOUR_RPN_IP]/[NETMASK CIDR] | grep HostMin
HostMin: X.X.X.X
```
The gateway is in place of `X.X.X.X`.

<Message type="tip">

The gateway does not ping, this is normal behavior.
