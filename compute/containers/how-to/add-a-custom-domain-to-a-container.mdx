Each container comes with an automatically generated domain on which it is available. However it is possible to use your own domain name to address your containers to facilitate their use.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- A running [Serverless Container](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/containers/how-to/deploy-a-container/)
- A domain name 

</Message>

1. Add a CNAME pointing to your container default URL from the [domains dashboard](/network/dns-cloud/how-to/manage-dns-records/).
2. Click the **Endpoints** tab on your containers' page.

3. Click on **+ Add a New Endpoint**.
4. Enter your custom URL and validate the form.
5. Connect to your container using your custom domain once you have checked the CNAME and TLS fields.

<Message type="note">

 Be careful, for now **Custom Domains** does not support websockets. If you need to use websockets you must configure them with the original URL.
