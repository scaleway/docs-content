Scaleway's Secret Manager has a new API version available: `v1beta1`!
This new version comes with major improvements:
- Improved resilience and scalability
- No more folder endpoints, but still the possibility to use paths to organize secrets
- Changing the path of a secret has become simpler

The Scaleway console now uses this version for the Secret Manager product pages. For more information, you can refer to the [API documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/secret-manager/).

Note that the `v1alpha1` API is still supported but it will eventually be deprecated.
