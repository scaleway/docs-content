Edge Services is an additional feature for Scaleway Load Balancers and Object Storage buckets.

<Macro id="edge-services-lb-benefits" />

Read on to learn how to create an Edge Services pipeline for your Load Balancer origin.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)

## How to subscribe to Edge Services

To use Edge Services, you must subscribe to a [pricing plan](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/network/#edge-services). Within its monthly price, each pricing plan lets you create a certain number of pipelines and consume a certain amount of cache data.

Find out more about pricing plans and how to subscribe to Edge Services in our [dedicated documentation](/network/edge-services/how-to/subscribe-edge-services/).

## How to create an Edge Services pipeline for Load Balancer

<Message type="tip">
You can create an Edge Services pipeline from the **Edge Services** section of the console, however, in this documentation, we describe how to initiate pipeline creation directly from the **Load Balancers** dashboard.
</Message>

1. Click **Load Balancers** in the **Network** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of your Load Balancers displays.

2. Click the **Edge Services** tab.

3. Click **Create Edge Services pipeline**. The pipeline creation wizard displays.
