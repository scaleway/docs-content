## Environment variables priority

When the same environment variable is injected by multiple sources, the Scaleway infrastructure follows a precedence rule to determine the value for that variable.

The order of precedence, from highest to lowest is the following.

1. Environment variables defined in your command-line environment.

2. Static variables (i.e. variables set in a Terraform/OpenTofu configuration file).

3. Variables defined in the [Scaleway configuration file](/scaleway-sdk/reference-content/scaleway-configuration-file/)
