You can boot your Instances using local boot or a rescue image. This page explains how to use each of these boot modes.

<Message type="tip">
  - You can choose to use **cloud-init** when [creating an Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) via **Advanced settings**. This enables you to control the mode of the Instance's very first boot.
  - Your Instance must be [powered off](/instances/how-to/power-off-instance/) in order to change its boot mode.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An [Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/)

## How to use local boot

Local boot allows you to start your Instance with a local configuration and a specific kernel version. This is the default option. You only need to follow these instructions to revert to local boot after using a different boot mode.

1. Click **CPU & GPU Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The [Instances page](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) displays.
2. Click the Instance you wish to start with a local boot.
3. Use the toggle <Icon name="toggle" /> in the top right corner of the screen to **power off** your Instance.
4. Click the **Advanced settings** tab.
5. In the **Boot mode** section, select **Use local boot**.
6. Click **Save**.
7. Use the toggle <Icon name="toggle" /> in the top right corner of the screen to **power on** your Instance.

    Your Instance starts using local boot.

## How to use rescue mode

Rescue mode restarts your Instance via the network on a minimal operating system. You can use rescue mode to debug your Instance and recover your system data.

1. Click **CPU & GPU Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The [Instances page](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) displays.
2. Click the Instance you wish to boot into Rescue Mode.
3. Use the toggle <Icon name="toggle" /> in the top right corner of the screen to **power off** your Instance.
4. Click the **Advanced settings** tab.
5. In the **Boot mode** section, select **Use rescue image**.
6. Click **Save**.
7. Use the toggle <Icon name="toggle" /> in the top right corner of the screen to **power on** your Instance.

    Your Instance starts in Rescue mode.

## How to use cloud-init

[Cloud-init](/instances/concepts/#cloud-init) enables automatic configuration of an Instance as it boots into the cloud, turning it from a generic Ubuntu image into a configured server in a few seconds.

The cloud-init program can consume and execute data from the user-data field of the Scaleway console. The process then behaves differently depending on the format of the information it finds. One of the most popular formats for scripts within user-data is the cloud-config file format. Cloud-config files are special scripts designed to be run by the cloud-init process.
These are generally used for initial configuration on the very first boot of a server. **Cloud-init is available for all Scaleway Instances OS images.**

Follow the instructions below to reboot an existing Instance using cloud-init.

1. Click **CPU & GPU Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The [Instances page](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) displays.
2. Click the Instance you wish to use with cloud-init.
3. Click the **Advanced settings** tab.
4. In the **Cloud-init** section, use the toggle icon to activate **Use cloud-init**.
5. Enter your **user-data**. User data is the mechanism by which a user can pass information contained in a local file to an Instance at launch time. The typical use case is to pass something like a shell script or a configuration file as user data.

    Cloud-init supports different input formats for user-data:

    | Format                 | Starts with      | Description                                                                                  |
    |------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | **Cloud Config File**  | `#cloud-config` | This file contains `cloud-config` data.                                                     |
    | **Shell Script**       | `#!`            | A shell script executed at `rc.local` like level during first boot.                         |
    | **Include File**       | `#include`      | Contains a list of one or more URLs. Content from these URLs is processed similarly.         |
    | **Gzip Compressed Content** | N/A        | Gzip compressed content is decompressed and used as if uncompressed. Useful for data limits.|
    | **MIME multipart archive** | N/A         | Specifies multiple data types in one file (e.g., shell script + cloud-config).               |
    | **Upstart Job**        | `#upstart-job`  | Specifies an Upstart job to be executed.                                                    |
    | **Cloud Boothook**     | `#cloud-boothook` | Contains scripts run very early in the boot process.                                        |
    | **Part Handler**       | `#part-handler` | Provides custom handling for specific data parts.                                           |

6. Click **Save**.
7. Click **Reboot** in the top right corner of the page, and confirm the reboot of your Instance when prompted.

    Your Instance is rebooted using cloud-init.
## How to change the boot volume

The [boot-on-block](/instances/concepts/#boot-on-block) feature allows Instances to boot from attached [Block Storage](/instances/concepts/#block-volumes) volumes instead of local volumes. When [creating an Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/), you can select Block Storage as a boot volume.

Once the Instance is created, you can select a different volume to boot from.

1. Click **CPU & GPU Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The [Instances page](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) displays.
2. Click the Instance you wish to change the boot volume for.
3. Click the **Advanced settings** tab.
4. Go to the **Boot volume** section.
5. Select a volume in the drop-down.
6. Click **Save and reboot now** to reboot instantly. Alternatively, click **Save and reboot later**.
    <Message type="important">
      If you have two or more volumes with identical operating systems, or a volume with no operating system, choosing one of these as your boot volume may cause unpredictable boot behavior.
