  **Kubernetes customers must not migrate their block volumes to the Block Storage API to prevent major disruptions to their Kubernetes service and block volume unavailability.**. You can identify your volumes by [listing them](/storage/block/api-cli/identifying-volume-snapshot-api/#listing-volumes-created-with-the-block-storage-api) and referring to the `name` field, next to which you should see an output similar to `k8s_base_node_2024-07-26`.
