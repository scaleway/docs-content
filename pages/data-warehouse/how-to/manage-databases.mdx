## How to manage databases using the Scaleway console

During the private beta phase, the management of databases in your Data Warehouse for ClickHouse® deployment is limited to viewing databases  in your deployment.

## How to manage databases using frameworks

[Connect to your deployment](/data-warehouse/how-to/connect-applications/) using your preferred framework. 
    <Message type="tip">
    You can also connect using the ClickHouse HTTP console from the **Overview** tab of your deployment. Make sure to enter valid credentials in the top-right fields.

Once connected, you can run SQL queries to `CREATE/ALTER/DROP` your `DATABASE/TABLE`.
