You can view your Edge Services metrics via [Scaleway Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/quickstart/). This allows you to monitor your ingress, egress, request rate and cache hit ratio as well as other metrics, in a convenient managed Grafana dashboard.

Access your Edge Services dashboard in the Scaleway console via the shortcut in the Edge Services tab of the pipeline in question. Note that you will first need to [create a Grafana user and credentials](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/observability/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/).

### Understanding the dashboard

The Grafana dashboard presents a number of different metrics. Use the drop-down in the top left to select which pipeline and origin to view Edge Services metrics for, and the time range drop-down in the top right to modify the time period to apply to the metrics.

- **Request rate**: The number of requests made to Edge Services per second, for the specified origin, averaged over the specified time period.
- **Cache hit ratio**: The percentage of requests served from Edge Services' cache, compared to the total number of requests in total to Edge Services for this origin, over the specified time period.
- **Cache HIT/MISS**: A visual representation of the ratio of cache hits to misses, for the specified origin, over the specified time period.
    - **Cache hit line**: The number of requests per second made to Edge Services for this origin, which were served directly from its cache.
    - **Cache miss line**: The number of requests per second made to Edge Services for this origin, where the content was fetched from the origin rather than the cache. 
    - **Total line**: The number of requests per second made to Edge Services for this origin.

- **Egress (to client)**: The total volume of data served to clients from Edge Services, for the specified origin, over the specified time period.
- **Ingress (from origin)**: The total volume of data from the origin server to Edge Services over the specified time period. This represents the traffic that occurs when Edge Services retrieves content from the origin server in order to fulfill requests.
- **Edge Services throughput**: A visual representation of the rate of data transfer for the specified origin with Edge Services over the specified time period.
    - **Output bitrate line**: The rate at which data is being delivered from Edge Services to end users.
    - **Input bitrate line**: The rate at which Edge Services is fetching data from the origin server. Peaks in this line may represent times when Edge Services had to fetch content from the origin server, rather than being able to serve it directly from its own cache.

- **Requests served**: The total number of requests that Edge Services has successfully served, for the specified origin, over the specified time period.
- **Edge Services response statuses**: A visual representation of the distribution of HTTP response statuses for requests served by Edge Services over the specified time period. Consult [the full list of HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) for more information if necessary.

- **Request origin country**: The proportion of requests (to Edge Services for the specified origin over the specified time period) originating from different countries.
- **End users location**: A visual representation of where Edge Services end users have been making requests from geographically.

## How to monitor Edge Services with Scaleway Cockpit

You can view your Edge Services metrics via [Scaleway Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/quickstart/). This allows you to monitor your ingress, egress, request rate and cache hit ratio as well as other metrics, in a convenient managed Grafana dashboard.

Access your Edge Services dashboard in the Scaleway console via the shortcut in Edge Services tab of the bucket in question. Note that you will first need to [create a Grafana user and credentials](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/observability/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/).

### Understanding the dashboard

The Grafana dashboard presents a number of different metrics. Use the `Bucket name` drop-down in the top left to select which bucket to view Edge Services metrics for, and the time range drop-down in the top right to modify the time period to apply to the metrics.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-services-metrics.webp" alt="" />

- **Request rate**: The number of requests made to Edge Services per second, for the specified bucket, averaged over the specified time period.
- **Cache hit ratio**: The percentage of requests served from Edge Services' cache, compared to the total number of requests in total to Edge Services for this bucket, over the specified time period.
- **Cache HIT/MISS**: A visual representation of the ratio of cache hits to misses, for the specified bucket, over the specified time period.
    - **Cache hit line**: The number of requests per second made to Edge Services for this bucket, which were served directly from its cache.
    - **Cache miss line**: The number of requests per second made to Edge Services for this bucket, where the content was fetched from the bucket rather than the cache. 
    - **Total line**: The number of requests per second made to Edge Services for this bucket.

- **Egress (to client)**: The total volume of data served to clients from Edge Services, for the specified bucket, over the specified time period.
- **Ingress (from origin)**: The total volume of data from the origin bucket's server to Edge Services over the specified time period. This represents the traffic that occurs when Edge Services retrieves content from the bucket's server in order to fulfill requests.
- **Edge Services throughput**: A visual representation of the rate of data transfer for the specified bucket with Edge Services over the specified time period.
    - **Output bitrate line**: The rate at which data is being delivered from Edge Services to end users.
    - **Input bitrate line**: The rate at which Edge Services is fetching data from the origin bucket server. Peaks in this line may represent times when Edge Services had to fetch content from the origin bucket, rather than being able to serve it directly from its own cache.

- **Requests served**: The total number of requests that Edge Services has successfully served, for the specified bucket, over the specified time period.
- **Edge Services response statuses**: A visual representation of the distribution of HTTP response statuses for requests served by Edge Services over the specified time period. Consult [the full list of HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) for more information if necessary.

- **Request origin country**: The proportion of requests (to Edge Services for the specified bucket over the specified time period) originating from different countries.
- **End users location**: A visual representation of where Edge Services end users have been making requests from geographically.
