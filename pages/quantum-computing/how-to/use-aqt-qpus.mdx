**Alpine Quantum Technologies (AQT)** is an Austrian quantum computing company spin-off from the University of Innsbruck. They specialize in **trapped-ion** quantum computers, a technology renowned for its exceptional gate fidelity and long coherence times.

Unlike superconducting qubits which rely on printed circuits, AQT uses individual calcium ions confined in a vacuum trap as qubits. This approach allows for a unique feature: **all-to-all connectivity**. Any qubit can talk to any other qubit directly, simplifying circuit design and reducing the need for noisy SWAP gates.

## IBEX-Q1: The Universal Trapped-Ion QPU

The **IBEX-Q1** (specifically the `QPU-IBEX-12PQ` platform on Scaleway) is AQT's general-purpose quantum processor.

### Key Features
* **All-to-all Connectivity:** The ions are arranged in a linear chain but controlled by lasers that can entangle any pair. This massively reduces circuit depth for complex algorithms like QAOA or QML.
* **High Fidelity:** Trapped ions offer some of the lowest error rates in the industry for 2-qubit gates.
* **Room Temperature Operation:** The system fits in standard rack cabinets and does not require the massive dilution refrigerators needed for superconducting qubits.

### Use Cases
Thanks to its connectivity, the IBEX QPU is particularly well suited for:
* **Combinatorial Optimization:** Problems where variables are highly interdependent (Finance, Logistics).
* **Quantum Simulation:** Simulating complex molecules where entanglement structure is dense.
* **Deep Circuits:** Algorithms requiring long computation times before decoherence sets in.

## Qiskit: The Industry Standard SDK

**Qiskit** is an open-source software development kit (SDK) widely used to program quantum computers. Originally developed by IBM, it has become a standard language for the quantum ecosystem.

It allows you to:
* **Build** quantum circuits using Python.
* **Transpile** (optimize) them for specific hardware.
* **Execute** them on various backends (simulators or real QPUs).

On Scaleway QaaS, we provide a dedicated provider `qiskit-scaleway` that allows you to use standard Qiskit code to target AQT's hardware seamlessly.

## Accessing AQT via Scaleway QaaS

Scaleway acts as a bridge, allowing you to run Qiskit circuits directly on AQT's machines hosted in Innsbruck, or on their digital twins (emulators) hosted on Scaleway's GPU clusters.

### 1. Prerequisites

* A Scaleway account with a valid **Project ID**.
* A Scaleway **API Key** (Secret Key).
* Python installed with the `qiskit-scaleway` package.

### 2. Installation

Install the official Scaleway provider for Qiskit:

```bash
pip install qiskit-scaleway
```

<Message type="important">
  **Billing Warning:** AQT QPUs are billed **Pay-As-You-Go**. You pay a fixed fee per circuit + a fee per shot. There is no need to "Book" the QPU; jobs are processed via a shared queue.
</Message>

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit_scaleway import ScalewayProvider

# 1. Connection credentials
PROJECT_ID = "your-scaleway-project-id"
SECRET_KEY = "your-scaleway-secret-key"

# 2. Initialize the Scaleway Provider
provider = ScalewayProvider(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    secret_key=SECRET_KEY
)

# 3. Select the Backend
# - 'QPU-IBEX-12PQ' : The real hardware (Paid per shot)
# - 'EMU-IBEX-12PQ-L4' : The emulator (Digital Twin) running on GPU, billed per minute
backend_name = "QPU-IBEX-12PQ"

try:
    backend = provider.get_backend(backend_name)
    print(f"Connected to backend: {backend.name}")

    # 4. Create a Quantum Circuit (e.g., Bell State)
    # Note: AQT supports all-to-all connectivity, so you don't need to worry about coupling maps.
    qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
    qc.h(0)
    qc.cx(0, 1)
    qc.measure_all()

    # 5. Execute the Job
    # Warning: On the real QPU, this line triggers billing.
    print("Submitting job...")
    job = backend.run(qc, shots=100)

    # 6. Retrieve Results
    result = job.result()
    counts = result.get_counts()
    print("Results:", counts)

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

### 3. Understanding Platform Names

Scaleway exposes AQT resources via two distinct Platform IDs that you must specify when selecting a backend:

* **`QPU-IBEX-12PQ`**: This connects you to the **real trapped-ion quantum computer** located at AQT's headquarters, in Innbruck. Use this for final runs and validatable experiments.
* **`EMU-IBEX-12PQ-L4`**: This connects you to a **noisy emulator** hosted on Scaleway's L4 GPU instances. It mimics the IBEX connectivity and gates but runs classically. Use this for debugging and testing your code logic before paying for real quantum shots.
