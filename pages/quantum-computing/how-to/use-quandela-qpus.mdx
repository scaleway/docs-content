**Quandela** is a European leader in photonic quantum computing. Their technology relies on manipulating light (single photons) through linear optical components to perform quantum calculations.

Unlike superconducting qubits or cold atoms, Quandela's photonic approach uses "qumodes" and photons that circulate in optical circuits at room temperature (although emitters and detectors require cooling). This offers a promising path towards a modular and scalable quantum computer.

To control these processors (QPUs) and run advanced simulations, Quandela develops **Perceval**, a reference open-source SDK.

## How to access Quandela via Perceval

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account with a valid **Project ID**.
- A Scaleway **API Key** (Secret Key).
- Python and [Quandela Perceval](https://github.com/Quandela/Perceval) installed on your local machine

1. Create a file with the following script to create a session, define a simple circuit, and run it. Replace `$SCW_PROJECT_ID` and `$SCW_SECRET_KEY` with your Scaleway Project ID and secret key.

    <Message type="tip">
    Scaleway Quantum Computing provides privileged access to Quandela's physical QPUs and high-performance emulators optimized for GPUs hardware. Integration is done directly via the `perceval.providers.scaleway` module.

    ```python
    import perceval as pcvl
    import perceval.providers.scaleway as scw

    # The session handles resource allocation and billing
    session = scw.Session(
        platform_name="QPU-ASCELLA-6PQ",  # Example of a Ascella photonic platform
        project_id="$SCW_PROJECT_ID",
        token="your-scaleway-api-key"
    )

    try:
        # Starts the session (provisions the resource, as it is a real QPU without booking, you will be billing on circuit & shot count)
        session.start()

        # 3. Create the Remote Processor
        processor = session.build_remote_processor()

        # 4. Define the Circuit (Simple Example: Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference)
        # Using a 50:50 Beam Splitter (Hadamard)
        circuit = pcvl.Circuit(2) // pcvl.BS.H()

        processor.set_circuit(circuit)
        processor.with_input(pcvl.BasicState("|1,1>")) # Input: 1 photon in each mode
        processor.min_detected_photons_filter(2)       # Keep only 2-photon events

        # 5. Execution (Sampling)
        sampler = pcvl.algorithm.Sampler(processor, max_shots_per_call=10000)
        job = sampler.samples(1000) # Request 1000 shots

        print("Sampling results:")
        print(job['results'])

    finally:
        session.stop() # Stops the session
    ```
4. Save the script. In this example we save it as `percival.py`.

5. Run the script.
    ```bash
    python ~/percival.py
    ```

## How to manage a session
- **Context Manager** (`with`) - You can use `with scw.Session(...) as session`: to automatically handle starting and stopping the session, ensuring you do not forget to stop it.
