import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'


<Requirements />

- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization


## Problem

One of the following messages display when trying to access your bucket using Scaleway Object Storage:

- `Failed to preprocess target Error: S3 error: Access Denied`
- `Error: Shared memory connection was closed.`
- `Failed to upload disk 'shadowSpec>'`
- `Agent failed to process method {DataTransfer.SyncDisk}.`

#### Cause

The application cannot access the Object Storage resource.

#### Solution

If you encounter one or several of the error messages above:

- Check for issues with your API key by following [this procedure](/object-storage/troubleshooting/api-key-does-not-work/).

- Make sure that you have the `ObjectStorageFullAccess` [IAM permission](/iam/concepts/#permission).

- Make sure that there is no [bucket policy](/object-storage/api-cli/bucket-policy/) preventing the application to access your bucket.

## Going further

- If you did not manage to identify the error and solve it by yourself, [open a support ticket](/account/how-to/open-a-support-ticket/), and provide as many details as possible, along with the necessary information below:
    - Object Storage Endpoint (e.g. `s3.fr-par.scw.cloud`)
    - Bucket name
    - Object name (if the request concerns an object)
    - Request type (PUT, GET, etc.)
    - HTTP status code
    - Date and time (timestamp)
    - User-agent (SDK, client, console, etc.)
    - Transaction ID (if possible)
    - Log / trace of the error (if possible)
