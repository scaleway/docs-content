Whenever your Database Instance volume is close to reaching full capacity, your Database Instance switches to `disk_full` mode. 

The Database Instance switches to `disk_full` mode when the amount of free space in the volume falls under 2% of the total volume size. 

For Database Instances where 2% of the volume size is more than 2GB, this threshold is 2GB.

This state allows you to increase your volume, if you use Block Storage, or [upgrade your node type](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/upgrade-a-database/). You are also able to clear some space in your volume increase your capacity. 

When the Database Instance switches to `disk_full` state, the default transaction mode automatically switches to `read only`. This allows your applications to still access its data, while preventing new data from being added.

If you wish to clear out space in your Database Instance volume, you can carry out the following actions:

1. [Connect to your Database Instance](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/connect-database-instance). 
2. Run the following commands to shift to a`read write` transaction:
    ```sql
    -- On PostgreSQL
    BEGIN;
    SET TRANSACTION READ WRITE;
    ```

    ```sql
    -- On MySQL
    SET transaction_read_only=0;
    BEGIN;
    ```
3. Clear out data from your database.
4. Commit your changes.
    ```
    COMMIT;
    ```

When there is once again enough space available in the Database Instance, the default transaction mode changes back to `read write`, allowing operations to return to normal.

  Failing to clear out some of your data, or forcing insertions while the database is in `disk_full` mode leads to downtime
