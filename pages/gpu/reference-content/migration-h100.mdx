Scaleway is optimizing its H100 GPU Instance portfolio to improve long-term availability and provide better performance for all users.

We recommend users to migrate their workload from PCIe-based GPU Instances to SXM GPU Instances for improvements in performance and fure-proof access to GPUs. As H100 PCIe-variants becomes increasingly scarce, migrating ensures uninterrupted access to H100-class compute.

## Benefits of the migration

There are two primary scenarios: migrating **Kubernetes (Kapsule)** workloads or **standalone** workloads.

<Message type="important">
  Always ensure that your **data is backed up** before performing any operations that could affect it. Keep in mind that **Scratch Storage** is ephemere and does not survive once the Instance is stopped: doing a full stop/start cycle will **erase the scratch data**. However, doing a simple reboot or using the stop in place function will keep the data.

### Migrating Kubernetes workloads (Kubernetes Kapsule)

If you are using Kapsule, follow these steps to move existing workloads to nodes powered by `H100-SXM-2-80G`.

<Message type="important">
  The Kubernetes autoscaler may get stuck if it tries to scale up a node pool with  out-of-stock. We recommend switching to `H100-SXM-2-80G` proactively to avoid disruptions.

#### Step-by-step
1. Create a new node pool using `H100-SXM-2-80G` GPU Instances.

2. Run `kubectl get nodes` to check that the new nodes are in a `Ready` state.
3. Cordon the nodes in the old node pool to prevent new Pods from being scheduled there. For each node, run: `kubectl cordon <node-name>`
    <Message type="tip">
      You can use a selector on the pool name label to cordon or drain multiple nodes at the same time if your app allows it (ex. `kubectl cordon -l k8s.scaleway.com/pool-name=mypoolname`)
    </Message>
4. Drain the nodes to evict the Pods gracefully.
   - For each node, run: `kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data`
   - The `--ignore-daemonsets` flag is used because daemon sets manage Pods across all nodes and will automatically reschedule them.
   - The `--delete-emptydir-data` flag is necessary if your Pods use emptyDir volumes, but use this option carefully as it will delete the data stored in these volumes.
   - Refer to the [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/safely-drain-node/) for further information.
5. Run `kubectl get pods -o wide` after draining, to verify that the Pods have been rescheduled to the new node pool.
6. Delete the old node pool.

### Migrating a standalone Instance

For standalone GPU instances, you can recreate your environment using a `H100-SXM-2-80G` GPU Instance using either the CLI, API or in visual mode using the Scaleway console.

#### Quick Start (CLI example):
1. Stop the Instance.
    ```
    scw instance server stop <instance_id> zone=<zone>
    ```
    Replace `<zone>` with the Availability Zone of your Instance. For example, if your Instance is located in Paris-1, the zone would be `fr-par-1`. Replace `<instance_id>` with the ID of your Instance.
    <Message type="tip">
    You can find the ID of your Instance on it's overview page in the Scaleway console or using the CLI by running the following command: `scw instance server list`.
    </Message>

2. Update the commercial type of the Instance
    ```
    scw instance server update <instance_id> commercial-type=H100-SXM-2-80G zone=<zone>
    ```
    Replace `<instance_id>` with the UUID of your Instance and `<zone>` with the Availability Zone of your GPU Instance.

3. Power on the Instance.
    ```
    scw instance server start <instance_id> zone=<zone>
    ```
For further information, refer to the [Instance CLI documentation](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/blob/master/docs/commands/instance.md).

<Message type="tip">
  You can also migrate your GPU Instances using the [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/instances/api-cli/migrating-instances/) and via [Scaleway console](/instances/how-to/migrate-instances/).

## FAQ

#### Are PCIe-based H100 being discontinued?
H100 PCIe-based GPU Instances are not End-of-Life (EOL), but due to limited availability, we recommend migrating to `H100-SXM-2-80G` to avoid future disruptions.

#### Is H100-SXM-2-80G compatible with my current setup?
Yes — it runs the same CUDA toolchain and supports standard frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.). No changes in your code base are required when upgrading to a SXM-based GPU Instance.

#### Why is H100-SXM better for multi-GPU?
The NVIDIA H100-SXM outperforms the H100-PCIe in multi-GPU configurations due to its superior interconnect and higher power capacity.
It leverages fourth-generation NVLink and NVSwitch, providing up to 900 GB/s of bidirectional bandwidth for rapid GPU-to-GPU communication, compared to the H100-PCIe's 128 GB/s via PCIe Gen 5, which creates bottlenecks in demanding workloads like large-scale AI training and HPC. 
Additionally, the H100-SXM’s 700W TDP enables higher clock speeds and sustained performance, while the H100-PCIe’s 300-350W TDP limits its throughput.
For high-communication, multi-GPU tasks, the H100-SXM is the optimal choice, while the H100-PCIe suits less intensive applications with greater flexibility.

#### What if my workload needs more CPU or RAM?
Let us know via [support ticket](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create) what your specific requoirements are. Currently we are evaluating options for compute-optimized configurations to complement our GPU offerings.
