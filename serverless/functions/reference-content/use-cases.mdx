Scaleway Serverless Functions can be used in endless use cases:
- Automation for specific tasks
- Integration with your ecosystem to help scaling specific routes of your code
- CI/CD integration
- Data analysis and processing
- Optimising infrastructures
- Decoupling software
- ...

For better understanding of Serverless Functions we provide real world examples in our [serverless-examples repository](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-examples).

Here are some specific cases:

## Node - Interact with database:

This example shows how to connect to a managed PostgreSQL database and perform a query on it.

## Python - ChatBot:

This example shows how to handle different HTTP methods (POST and GET) as well as specific dependencies.

## Go - SQS Publish message

You can use this example to publish a message to an SQS queue using the MNQ namespace from the Scaleway Go SDK.

## PHP - Repository Badge Generator

This example demonstrates how PHP functions work using a dependency from composer. With this example, you can generate a simple badge with the text, status and color of your choice.

## Rust - Character recognition
