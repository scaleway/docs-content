## I cannot pay my invoice

### Cause
Your payment may have failed due to insufficient funds, an issue with your payment method, or incorrect SEPA mandate details.
You can see the details of your payment attempt errors in your invoice history.

Click the **Eye icon** next to the invoice you want to check in the Scaleway console. A pop-up appears with the full history of payments and failed payment attempts related to the invoice.

### Solution

Depending on the errors you see, you can try the solutions below.

**If you are paying by credit card**
 - Ensure you have enough funds in your bank account.
 - If payment still does not work, the reason for the failure is indicated in the error message in the console
<Message type="tip">
  A `card_declined` error message means the payment was refused by your bank. Contact your bank for more details.
</Message>

**If you are paying via SEPA direct debit:**
- Verify that your SEPA mandate is correctly set up to ensure future payments are processed.
- Verify that your billing address matches the country of your bank account.
- Retry the payment.
<Message type="requirement">
  Unpaid invoices must be paid by credit card.
</Message>

## I did not receive my invoice

### Cause
Your invoice may not have been delivered due to an incorrect billing contact email or an issue with email delivery.

### Solution
**Verify your billing email address:**
- Check the [billing contact](/billing/faq/#how-can-i-add-a-billing-contact-to-my-account) section in your Scaleway console to ensure the email address is correct.
- Check your spam or junk folder.
<Message type="tip">
  You can also [download the your invoices](/billing/how-to/download-an-invoice/) from the console.

## I have no access to my invoices

### Cause
Access to invoices is restricted based on your role and permissions within the Scaleway Organization. Only users with the necessary IAM rights can view the billing section.

### Solution
- [Check your permissions within your Organization](/iam/quickstart/#how-to-give-permissions-to-users-and-applications-via-policies): if you are not the owner of the Organization, ensure that you have the appropriate IAM rights to access the billing section.
- If you do not have the necessary permissions, ask the Organization owner for access.

## I deleted my resources but I still receive invoices

### Cause
Some resources may continue to generate charges even after deletion. Common reasons include:
- **Elastic Metal servers**: billing continues until the server is fully deleted. If the server is only powered off but not deleted, charges will still apply.
- **Flexible IP addresses**: reserved flexible IPs are billed even if they are not attached to an active resource.
- **Volumes and snapshots**: detached volumes or stored snapshots from deleted Instances may still incur storage charges.
- **Pro-rata billing**: Scaleway operates on a pay-as-you-go model, so you may receive an invoice for usage incurred before deletion, even if the resource was removed before the end of the billing cycle.

### Solution
**Verify deleted resources:**
- Check your Scaleway console to ensure that all associated resources (e.g., servers, IPs, volumes, snapshots) have been fully deleted.
- Review your billing details.
