If you are using Scaleway's [managed Kubernetes solution](/containers/kubernetes/quickstart/), you may want to create a Load Balancer in order to expose  an application running inside your cluster to the internet.

Load Balancers for Kubernetes clusters should **always** be provisioned via the cluster's Cloud Controller Manager. It is **not** correct procedure to provision the Load Balancer by creating a Scaleway Load Balancer in the console or via the API, and then attempting to use it as your cluster's external Load Balancer.

Full documentation for creating and configuring a Load Balancer for your cluster can be found in the Kubernetes section, on the following pages:

- [Exposing Kubernetes services to the internet](/containers/kubernetes/reference-content/exposing-services/)
- [Creating and configuring a Load Balancer service](/containers/kubernetes/reference-content/kubernetes-load-balancer/)
- [Managing Load Balancer IPs](/containers/kubernetes/reference-content/managing-load-balancer-ips/)
- [Using Load Balancer annotations](/containers/kubernetes/reference-content/using-load-balancer-annotations/)
- [Exposing a Kubernetes Kapsule ingress controller service with a Load Balancer](/containers/kubernetes/reference-content/lb-ingress-controller/)
