ENT1 Instances are now deprecated and unavailable for new deployments. Existing ENT1 Instances will continue to function, but we recommend [migrating to our newer offerings](/instances/how-to/migrate-instances/) for improved performance and ongoing support.
[POP2 Instances](/instances/reference-content/general-purpose/#pop2-instances), which share the same hardware specifications as ENT1 Instances, provide access to the latest features, ensuring your infrastructure remains current with evolving technology and demands.
