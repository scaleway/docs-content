A default Websocket network is automatically created with each Hub. Similarly to the default network, it cannot be deleted.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have [created an IoT Hub](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/create-hub)

</Message>


1. [Add a Hub device](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/add-device) if you haven't already done so.  
To keep this tutorial simple, choose to `Allow Insercure` connections. Insecure connections allow connections to the hub without encryption layer.

2. Configure the physical device (or client) to connect through the network, using the following parameters:

    - **Host**: The network endpoint.
    - **Port**: Use `80` for plaintext or `443` for TLS.
    - **MQTT Username**: The *Device ID* from the device you created earlier.
    - If your client asks for a password, just pass in an empty string.
    
    <Message type="important">

    Mutual TLS authentication is not yet available on this network, which means that devices that connect over this network must `Allow Insecure` connections.

    </Message>

3. Connect and exchange messages.
