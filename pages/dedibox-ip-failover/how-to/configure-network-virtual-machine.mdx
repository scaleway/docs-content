When you install your server with a virtualization solution like Proxmox, you can create multiple virtual machines on the physical server. This setup allows you to have separate environments for different services (e.g., mail and web services) or to optimize the server's performance by running several virtual machines.

To communicate on the internet, each of your virtual machines needs an IP address. You can use failover IPs to have additional IP addresses available for your server.

<Message type="tip">
  You can configure a unique gateway for your virtual machines, allowing them to move between hypervisors without changing their network configuration.

  * IP address of the unique gateway: `62.210.0.1`

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- [Created](/dedibox/how-to/order-a-server/) a Dedibox dedicated server and installed a hypervisor on it
- Ordered a [failover IP](/dedibox-ip-failover/concepts/#failover-ips)
- Generated a [virtual MAC address](/dedibox-ip-failover/concepts/#virtual-mac-address)

Find below examples of network interface configurations on different distributions inside a virtual machine:

## Ubuntu

Since the release of version 18.04 (Bionic Beaver), Ubuntu has used Netplan for configuring network interfaces. For older releases, refer to the Debian configuration.

1. Log into your virtual machine and open the network configuration file `/etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml` in a text editor of your choice:
    ```sh
    sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
    ```
2. Create a network configuration as follows. Replace `<failover_IP>` with your failover IP address:
    ```yaml
    network:
      version: 2
      ethernets:
        ens18:
          addresses:
            - <failover_IP>/32
          nameservers:
            addresses: [ "51.159.47.28", "51.159.47.26" ]
          routes:
            - to: default
              via: 62.210.0.1
            - to: 62.210.0.1/32
              via: <failover_IP>
              scope: link
    ```
3. Save the file and exit the text editor.
4. Apply the new configuration:
    ```sh
    sudo netplan apply
    ```

## Debian

1. Log into the virtual machine and edit the network configuration file:
    ```sh
    sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
    ```
2. Configure the network interface as follows. Replace `<failover_IP>` with your failover IP address:
    ```ini
    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet static
        address <failover_IP>
        netmask 255.255.255.255
        pointopoint 62.210.0.1
        gateway 62.210.0.1
    ```
3. Save the file and exit the text editor.
4. Set the DNS server information:
    ```sh
    sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
    ```
5. Add the following DNS resolvers:
    ```plaintext
    nameserver 51.159.47.28
    nameserver 51.159.47.26
    ```
6. Activate the network on your virtual machine:
    ```sh
    sudo ifup eth0
    ```
    *Alternatively, you can restart networking with:*
    ```sh
    sudo systemctl restart networking
    ```

## CentOS

1. Log into the virtual machine and edit the network configuration file:
    ```sh
    sudo nano /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
    ```
2. Configure the network interface as follows. Replace `<failover_IP>` with your failover IP address and `<virtual_MAC>` with the virtual MAC of the VM:
    ```ini
    DEVICE=eth0
    BOOTPROTO=none
    ONBOOT=yes
    USERCTL=no
    IPV6INIT=no
    PEERDNS=yes
    TYPE=Ethernet
    NETMASK=255.255.255.255
    IPADDR=<failover_IP>
    GATEWAY=62.210.0.1
    DNS1=51.159.47.28
    DNS2=51.159.47.26
    ARP=yes
    HWADDR=<virtual_MAC>
    ```
3. Save and close the text editor.
4. Create or edit the routing configuration file:
    ```sh
    sudo nano /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-eth0
    ```
    Add the following lines:
    ```ini
    62.210.0.1 dev eth0
    default via 62.210.0.1 dev eth0
    ```
5. Activate the network interface:
    ```sh
    sudo ifup eth0
    ```

## Windows Server

1. Open the network settings on your VM by navigating to:
    ```
    Control Panel → Network & Internet → Change Adapter Options
    ```
2. Select your network adapter and enter the following details:
    - **IP Address**: `<failover_IP>`
    - **Subnet Mask**: `255.255.255.255`
    - **Gateway**: `62.210.0.1`
    - **DNS 1**: `51.159.47.28`
    - **DNS 2**: `51.159.47.26`

  Replace the IP of the DNS cache server with the one located in the same physical location as your machine for optimal performance. [Check the IPs for each data center](/account/reference-content/scaleway-network-information/#dns-cache-servers)
