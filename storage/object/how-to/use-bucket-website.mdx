The Bucket Website feature allows you to host [static websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) using Scaleway [Object Storage](https://www.scaleway.com/en/object-storage/). 

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)  - You have [configured your API keys](/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key/)
  - You have [created an Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)

  <Message type="note">

  The **index** and **error** files are commonly named `index.html` and `error.html`, respectively.

  A warning message informs you that: 

  <Message type="important">

  When Bucket Website is enabled, a default [bucket policy](/storage/object/concepts#bucket-policy) is applied. All objects in the bucket then become publicly visible. You can create your own bucket policy to change the visibility settings [via CLI](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/).

  </Message>
5. Enter the names and click **Save configuration** to confirm. The details of your website configuration display. 
  After setting up the basic bucket website configuration, you can upload the **index** and the **error** files to your bucket, as well as the other files that make up your static website.
  <Message type="note">

  If this is your first time uploading objects into a bucket, you can follow the step-by-step on [this documentation page](/storage/object/how-to/upload-files-into-a-bucket/).

  </Message>
6. Access the website by clicking on the **Website URL**.

  <Message type="note">

  You can also [configure a CNAME record](/tutorials/s3-customize-url-cname/) for your bucket URL, to be able to access the website through a domain name of your choice.
