## Usage limits

For the usage limits that apply when using Scaleway Queues, see the dedicated sections on our [Organization quotas](/organizations-and-projects/additional-content/organization-quotas/) page. Limits (quotas) apply to, for example, the maximum number of queues and consumers/subscribers, as well as to message retention duration and storage.

## VPC

Queues is not currently compatible with [Scaleway VPC](/vpc/quickstart/).
