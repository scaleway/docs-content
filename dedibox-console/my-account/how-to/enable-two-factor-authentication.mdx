You can enable multifactor authentication on your account for heightened security. Once enabled, an additional security code, generated by your phone, is required to access your account.

Multifactor authentication provides an extra layer of security. As well as your password (the first factor), a second factor (the MFA app) is required to gain access to your account. Even in case of leaked password, your account is protected by this second layer of security.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net)
  - You have downloaded a MFA Authenticator application to your phone
</Message>

1. Click your user name next to _logged in as:_ in the top right corner of the console. Then click **Security** in the pop-up menu.

2. The security page displays. Click **SHOW QR CODE** to display the QR-code to add the Scaleway Dedibox console to your authenticator application.

    <Message type="tip">
      If your phone does not have a camera, you can manually enter the registration code shown in the console.
    </Message>
3. Open the authenticator application on your phone and scan the code using the application.
4. A registration code is displayed on your phone's display. Enter this code in the activation form and click **Enable** to validate.

Your account is now protected by multifactor authentication, and a security token will be requested upon your next login.

<Message type="important">
Make sure to keep your authentication device secure as you cannot log in without the MFA security token.
</Message>
