Private Networks allow you to create Private Networks that are scoped to a region rather than a specific [Availability Zone](/compute/instances/concepts/#availability-zone) (AZ). This means you can attach resources from multiple AZs of that region, to your Private Network.

You can find full documentation for the Scaleway VPC API on the [developers site](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/vpc/v2/).

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created an API key](/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key/)
</Message>

## Creating new Private Networks from scratch

1. Create a Private Network (in this case for the Paris region) via the API:

    <Message type="tip">
    You can find the Project ID in your Scaleway console at the URL `https://console.scaleway.com/<project-name>/settings`.
    </Message>

    ```
    POST https://api.scaleway.com/vpc/v2/regions/fr-par/private-networks 
    
    {"name": "<name>", "project_id": "<Project ID>"}
    ```

    Note the Private Network ID `(pn-id)` of the created Private Network.

2. Create resources of your choice (e.g. Instances, Elastic Metal servers, Public Gateways etc) either via the console or the API. Make sure you save the resource ID after creation. For example, [create an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) and note the Instance ID (`server-id` in the API).

3. Attach the resource to the Private Network you created, via the API. For an Instance, use the following API call:

    ```
    POST https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/<az>/servers/<server-id>/private_nics
    
    {"private_network_id":"<pn-id>"}
    ```

    The resource is now attached to the Private Network.

To list all of your Private Networks, use the following API call:

    ```
    GET https://api.scaleway.com/vpc/v2/regions/fr-par/private-networks
    ```
