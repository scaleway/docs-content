Scaleway Apple silicon is built using the latest generation of [Apple Mac mini](/bare-metal/apple-silicon/concepts/#mac-mini-M1) hardware (fifth generation). They are powered by Apple's [M1 silicon](/bare-metal/apple-silicon/concepts/#apple-m1) and also equipped with a 256 GB SSD and 8 GB of RAM for towering performances and revolutionary power efficiency.

Apple silicon is designed for developing, building, testing, and signing applications for Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, Mac computers and much more. Mac mini M1 uses an advanced neural engine for up to 15x faster machine learning.

  - Due to license constraints, the minimum lease for Apple silicon is 24 hours. As a result, a Mac mini M1 can only be deleted after 24 hours have passed from when you initiated the lease.
  - There is a maximum of one Mac mini M1 allowed per Organization per Availability Zone. For more information about available quotas, refer to our [documentation on account quotas](/console/my-account/reference-content/account-quotas/#apple-silicon-m1).

1. Click **Apple silicon** in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu. The Apple silicon creation page displays. 
2. Click **Create a Mac mini M1**. The Mac mini M1 creation wizard displays.
3. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 
    - Choose an **Availability Zone**, which is the geographical region where your Mac mini M1 will be deployed.
    - Select the **hardware configuration** for your Mac mini M1. 
    - Enter a **Name** for your Mac mini M1, or leave the randomly-generated name in place.

## How to connect to your Mac mini M1

### How to connect via VNC

VNC is a remote desktop-sharing protocol. It allows you to visualize the graphical screen output of a remote computer and to transfer local keyboard and mouse events to the remote computer by using a network connection.

1. Click **Apple silicon** in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu. A list of your Mac mini M1s displays.
2. Click the Mac mini M1 you want to connect to. Your Mac mini M1 **Overview** displays.
3. Click the **VNC** button to launch a VNC session on your Mac mini M1.
    
    Your VNC client opens, and you can log in the graphical environment of macOS using the default user m1 and your password.

    <Message type="note">
      macOS may ask you for your password once logged into the VNC session. Change the keyboard layout of macOS to your computer's local keyboard layout before entering the password. Click on U.S. keyboard in the top right corner, to display a list of all available keyboard layouts
