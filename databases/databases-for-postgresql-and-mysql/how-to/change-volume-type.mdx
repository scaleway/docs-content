- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have a [PostgreSQL or MySQL Database Instance](/databases/databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/quickstart)

</Message>

If you have a Database Instance with local storage, it is possible to change your volume type to Block Storage with the following steps. 

1. Click **Change Volume type** under **Volume settings** in your Database Instance information page.
  <Message type="important">

    Before changing the volume type, make sure your Instance is in one of the following states:
    - `READY`
    - `DISK_FULL`

  A pop up appears.

2. Select Block Storage.
3. Click **Validate** to confirm.

Alternatively, you can change the volume type from Block Storage to local storage by following the same steps. 

<Message type="important">

  Make sure your current node type has a local storage size greater than or equal to your current Block Storage size. If this is not the case, you must [upgrade your current node type](/databases/databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/upgrade-a-database/) to one with enough local storage before you change the volume type.
