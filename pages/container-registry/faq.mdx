## Overview

### What is Scaleway Container Registry?

Scaleway Container Registry is a fully managed mutualized Container Registry, designed to facilitate storing, managing, and deploying container images. It simplifies the development-to-production workflow as there is no need to operate its own Container Registry or worry about the underlying infrastructure.
You can store any docker container image on the Namespace and it is possible to set the visibility of each image towards your needs. It can either be private or public.
The Service is currently available in our `nl-ams` (Amsterdam, The Netherlands), `fr-par` (Paris, France), and `pl-waw` (Poland, Warsaw) Availability Zones.
