import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'

Installation from virtual media allows users to boot servers using custom ISO images over the network.
However, this feature is currently not supported on specific Elastic Metal server models due to instability issues.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An A610R or A215R  Elastic Metal server

## Affected servers

The following Elastic Metal server models are impacted by this limitation:

- A610R
- A215R

## Reason for lack of support

Installation through virtual media on the A610R and A215R servers is highly unstable due to hardware-specific compatibility issues with the virtual media boot process. We do not currently have a stable solution to resolve these problems.

<Message type="tip">
  For alternative installation methods, consider using the default OS images available directly from the Scaleway console or [rescue mode](/elastic-metal/how-to/use-rescue-mode/) for troubleshooting.

## Next steps

1. If you encounter issues during installation, verify your server model in the Scaleway console.
2. Use supported installation options, such as pre-built images from the console.
3. Contact [Scaleway technical support](https://console.scaleway.com/support) for assistance or updates on future support.

<Message type="note">
  We are working on potential solutions and will update this documentation once virtual media support is available for these models.
