This page shows how to create and manage [subscriptions](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#subscription) with Scaleway Topics and Events (formerly part of the Messaging and Queuing product). When you create a subscription to a [topic](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#topic), you are effectively signing up an endpoint to receive all messages published to that topic.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An existing [topic](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-topics/)

## How to create a subscription

1. Click **Topics and Events** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu.

2. Use the dropdown menu to select the [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) of the topic you want to create a subscription for.

3. Click the name of the topic you want to create a subscription for.

4. Click **Create Subscription**. The subscription creation wizard displays.

5. Verify the parameters of the topic that you are creating a subscription for (name, type and).

6. Choose a protocol, based on the type of endpoint or client you want to subscribe. Click the tab below for further details and full instructions on each protocol:

    <Tabs id="messaging-subscription-protocol">
        <TabsTab label="HTTP">
          <br />
          Select **HTTP** to create a subscription for a service or web server that can receive `HTTP POST` requests from Topics and Events, via standard HTTP protocol.

          Note that for security reasons, we recommend using the HTTPS protocol, rather than HTTP.

          You are prompted to enter the URL of the HTTP endpoint to subscribe, e.g. `example.com`. Note that the scheme (`http://`) is not required.

          After your HTTP subscription is created, you must confirm it. Find out how in our [dedicated documentation](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-subscriptions/#how-to-confirm-an-http-or-https-subscription).

        </TabsTab>
        <TabsTab label="HTTPS">
          <br />
          Select **HTTPS** to create a subscription for a service or web server that can receive `HTTP POST` requests from Topics and Events, via secure HTTP protocol.

          You are prompted to enter the URL of the HTTP endpoint to subscribe, e.g. `example.com`. Note that the scheme (`https://`) is not required.

          After your HTTP subscription is created, you must confirm it. Find out how in our [dedicated documentation](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-subscriptions/#how-to-confirm-an-http-or-https-subscription).
        </TabsTab>
        <TabsTab label="Serverless Functions and Containers">
          <br />
          Choose **Serverless Functions and Containers** to create a subscription for a Scaleway Serverless Function or Container that you have created.

          You are prompted to select the **namespace** containing the Function or Container that you want to subscribe. Only namespaces in the same [Project](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project) and [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) as the topic can be selected.

          You are prompted to select the Serverless Function or Container to subscribe. Only Functions and Containers with a public [privacy policy](/serverless/functions/concepts/#privacy-policy) can subscribe to an topic.
        </TabsTab>
        <TabsTab label="Queues">
          <br />
          Choose **Queues** to create a subscription for a Scaleway queue that you have created.

          You are prompted to select the **queue** to subscribe. Only queues in the same [Project](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project) and [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) as the topic can be selected.
        </TabsTab>
    </Tabs>

7. Click **Create subscription** to finish.

    The subscription is created. If you created an HTTP or HTTPS subscription, you will now need to **confirm** it, as described below. This step is not required for Serverless Functions / Containers or Queues subscriptions.

## How to confirm an HTTP or HTTPS subscription

An HTTP or HTTPS subscription will have a `Pending` status until you **confirm** it. This is essential for it to be able to start receiving messages. Follow the steps below to confirm the subscription:

1. Access the subscriptions listing page (from the console side menu, **Serverless** > **Topics and Events** > **Topics**, click the topic containing the subscription).

2. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the subscription you wish to confirm, then select **Confirm subscription** from the menu. A pop-up displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-topics-confirmation.webp" alt="In the Scaleway console, a pop-up displays saying 'A subscription confirmation message has been sent to the subscription endpoint. Retrieve the SubscribeURL value from the message and enter it in the box below. This is a necessary step to start receiving messages from the topic'." />

3. Retrieve the confirmation message that Scaleway Topics and Events sent to your endpoint (delivered as an `HTTP POST` request), and extract the `SubscribeURL` from the message payload.

4. Enter the `SubscribeURL` value (e.g. `https://sns.mnq.{region}.scaleway.com/?Action=ConfirmSubscription&TopicArn={your-topic-arn}&Token={your-subscription-token}`) in the box. The correct values for region, topic ARN and subscription token should be pre-filled for you in the URL.

5. Click **Confirm subscription**.

    The subscription's status is now shown as **Confirmed**. The subscription will now receive messages published to the topic.

## How to delete a subscription

When you no longer want a subscribed endpoint or service to receive messages from the topic, you can delete the subscription.

1. Click **Topics and Events** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu.

2. Use the drop-down menu to select the [region](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#region) containing the subscription you want to delete.

3. Click the topic containing the subscription you want to delete.

4. Click the **Subscriptions** tab. The list of subscriptions to this topic displays.

5. Either:
    - Click the subscription you wish to delete. The subscription's **Settings** page displays. Click the **Delete subscription** button in the bottom right corner.
    - Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the subscription you wish to delete, then select **Delete** from the menu that displays.

    A pop-up asks you to confirm that you understand this action will delete the subscription.

6. Type **DELETE** and click **Delete subscription**.
