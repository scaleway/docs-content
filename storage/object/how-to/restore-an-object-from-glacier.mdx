  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)  
  - You have [created an Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)
  - You have an object in [Glacier storage class](/storage/object/how-to/edit-storage-class)

</Message>

<Message type="important">

  Objects in Glacier can only be restored to Standard class. 

</Message>

<Message type="tip">
 
To facilitate the steps of restoration and ensure a fast restitution of your data, we recommend you use Glacier to store average sized files (larger than 1MB), as opposed to several small files.

## How to restore an object

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the bucket name that contains the objects you want to restore to `STANDARD` class. The list of objects displays.
3. Click the **Restore icon** next to the object that you want to restore:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-restore-button.webp" alt="" />

  <Message type="tip">

    Alternatively, click <Icon name="more" /> > **Restore**.

  </Message>

4. Enter the number of days after which the object will be transferred back to Glacier. 

5. Click **Restore object from S3 Glacier**.

<Message type="note">

Your object remains available in `STANDARD` class for the duration you chose during the restore process. It will be transferred automatically back to `GLACIER` once the configured period is over.

## Restore time 

The time it takes to restore an object depends on the size of the object and on if [multipart](/concepts/#multipart-uploads) is configured. If your object is larger than 1MB, it can take anywhere from a few minutes to 24 hours for restore to start.

For multipart objects, each part is equivalent to one object. Consequently, the more parts your object has, the longer the restore time will be.

To determine how many parts an object has, you can run the following `aws-cli` command:

```
aws s3api head-object --bucket <bucket-name> --key b
```
For a multipart object, the `Etag` includes a suffix that indicates the number of parts of the object. In the example below, the `-<PartNumber>` is 14:

```json
{
    "AcceptRanges": "bytes",
    "LastModified": "2022-08-16T12:07:00+00:00",
    "ContentLength": 141855946,
    "ETag": "\"df1c7b0641b048c77f7177e3d22dde78-14\"",
    "VersionId": "1660651620102268",
    "ContentType": "application/x-tar",
    "Metadata": {}
}
```
Therefore, in this example, the time it takes to restore the object (that has 14 parts) is equivalent to the time it takes to restore 14 objects.
