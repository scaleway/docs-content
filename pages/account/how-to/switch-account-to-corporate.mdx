The [Scaleway console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements) allows you to choose between four account use cases:

- **Corporate**
- **Startup**
- **Consultant or Freelancer**
- **Personal Project**.

All users are given the possibility to select one or the other option when first signing up for a Scaleway account.

When you select either **Corporate**, **Startup** or **Consultant or Freelancer**, your account is considered of the **Corporate** type.

When you select **Personal Project**, your account is considered of the **Personal** type.

If you signed up for a personal account and need to convert to a corporate one, follow these instructions.

<Message type="important">
  Switching to a corporate account is permanent. You will not be able to switch back to a personal account once the conversion to corporate is completed.
