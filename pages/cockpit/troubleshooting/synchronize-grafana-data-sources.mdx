This page shows you how to visualize your data again when it does not display on your Grafana dashboards, using the `SyncGrafanaDataSources` [endpoint](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/cockpit/v1/global-api/#path-grafana-synchronize-grafana-data-sources) of the [Cockpit Global API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/cockpit/v1/global-api/#path-grafana-synchronize-grafana-data-sources).

## Problem

Many Cockpit users often encounter issues with Grafana data sources not synchronizing properly, leading to missing data on dashboards when data should be available.

When users open their Grafana dashboards, they see a `No data` message along with an error banner stating: `Failed to upgrade legacy queries datasource was not found`.

<Lightbox src="scaleway_cpt_grafana_datasources_troubleshooting.webp" alt="Grafana dashboard showing error messages and warning signs of no data found for the user's datasources" />


## Solution

Open a terminal and run the following command to trigger the synchronization of your data sources:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"project_id":"$SCALEWAY_PROJECT_ID"}' \
    "https://api.scaleway.com/cockpit/v1/grafana/sync-data-sources"

Make sure that you replace `$SCW_SECRET_KEY` with your API secret key and `$SCALEWAY_PROJECT_ID` with the ID of the Scaleway Project affected by the issue.
