When you opt for outsourcing a Dedibox dedicated server, you entrust the technical management of your machines and services to another Scaleway Dedibox account while retaining control over your main account.

By outsourcing your servers, you grant permission to a third party to handle the management on your behalf. This means the designated Dedibox account holder will have access to all the necessary technical details of your Dedibox. However, it's important to note that they will not be able to view your billing information or make any changes to the services within your primary account. This ensures that you maintain full control over your billing and service configurations while benefiting from external technical expertise.

3. Click **Outsourcing** in the side menu of your server's status page:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-dedibox-console-dedibox-outsourcing.webp" width="800" alt="" />

    The outsourcing form displays.
4. Enter the identifier of the new technical contact for your server. The identifier is the login of the other user's console account. Click **Send request** to validate the form.
