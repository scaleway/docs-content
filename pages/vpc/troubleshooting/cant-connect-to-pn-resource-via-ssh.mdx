## Problem

I am unable to connect to a resource located inside a Private Network via the SSH bastion of a Public Gateway.

## Cause

Underscores (`_`) or successive dashes (`---`) in the names of resources inside a Private Network are converted to a single dash (`-`) for technical reasons.

## Solution

Replace underscores and successive dashes in the name of the resource you are trying to connect to by single dashes, as shown in the examples below.


**Connecting to an Instance in a Private Network**

```sh
# Failing SSH command
ssh -J bastion@192.168.0.1:61000 root@my-instance.my_private_network.internal

# Working SSH command
ssh -J bastion@192.168.0.1:61000 root@my-instance.my-private-network.internal
```

**Connecting to a Kapsule cluster node in a Private Network**

```sh
# Failing SSH command
ssh -J bastion@192.168.0.1:61000 root@my-k8s-cluster--prod--abc123

# Working SSH command
ssh -J bastion@192.168.0.1:61000 root@my-k8s-cluster-prod-abc123
```
