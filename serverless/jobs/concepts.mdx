## Container image

A container image is a file that includes all the requirements and instructions of a complete and executable version of an application. 
When running a job, the selected image will be pulled to execute your workload. Images can come from public external registries or from the [Scaleway Container Registry](/containers/container-registry/concepts/#container-registry).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Environment variables

An environment variable is a variable whose value is set outside the program, typically through functionality built into the operating system or microservice. An environment variable is made up of a name/value pair, and any number may be created and available for reference at a point in time.

## Job

Serverless Jobs is a fully managed solution that enables you to plan, schedule, queue and run batch processing workloads without worrying about provisioning and scaling.

<Concept>

## Job definition

A job Definition is an entity that holds data used to specify a job, such as the container image used, the resources allocated and the workload. The definition acts as a blueprint for [job runs](#job-run).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Job name

The name of a job is part of the [job definition](#job-definition) and is used for informational purposes only.

</Concept>

## Job run

A job run is the execution of a job definition. It can be in a queued, ongoing, canceled, or succeeded status. Each job run has a unique identifier and can be individually monitored using [Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/quickstart/)

## Maximum duration

Maximum duration option allows you to define the maximum execution time before your job is automatically killed.

</Concept>
