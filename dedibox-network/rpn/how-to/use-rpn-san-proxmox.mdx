<Message type="requirement">
  * You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net)
  * You have a [Dedibox dedicated server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/)
  * You have an [RPN SAN](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/storage/)
</Message>

## Configuration of Proxmox to use the RPN

1. Log in to your server as `root` using SSH:
    ```
    ssh root@sd-XXX.dedibox.fr
    ```
2. Edit the `/etc/network/interfaces` file, and replace the lines mentioning `eth1` by these ones:
    ```
    auto eth1
    iface eth1 inet dhcp
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      The interface may be named differently depending on your configuration. You can identify the RPN interface by running `ifconfig` which allows you to check the MAC address of the interface which is available in your Dedibox console.
    </Message>
3. Reboot your Proxmox server to complete the RPN configuration.

## Open-iSCSI installation and configuration

Proxmox requires the Open-iSCSI software to support mounting of iSCSI volumes. It may not be installed by default in your system.

1. Log in to your server as root using SSH.
    ```
    ssh root@sd-XXX.dedibox.fr
    ```
2. Install `open-iscsi` using the APT package manager.
    ```
    apt install open-iscsi
    ```
3. Open the file `/etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf` in a text editor, for example `nano`.
    ```
    vi /etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf
    ```

    * Adjust the following configuration directives:
    ```
    node.conn[0].timeo.noop_out_interval = 0
    node.conn[0].timeo.noop_out_timeout = 0
    node.session.timeo.replacement_timeout = 86400
    ```
    The purpose of this change is to prevent your file system from becoming read-only if the link is interrupted for more than two minutes (by default) between your server and the storage server, which can happen during maintenance periods.

    * Configure the setting for automatic reconnection of targets:
    ```
    node.startup = automatic
    ```

    * Change the following settings to take advantage of the data integrity check, if available:
    ```
    node.conn[0].iscsi.HeaderDigest = CRC32C,None
    node.conn[0].iscsi.DataDigest = CRC32C,None
    ```
    * Then save your configuration and quit the text editor.
7. Reboot your server.
    ```
    reboot
    ```

## Discover and connect to targets in Proxmox

1. In the **Server View**, click **Datacenter**, then **Storage**.
2. Click **Add** and then **iSCSI Target**. Fill in the form:
    * **ID:** any identifier used to name this RPN SAN volume
    * **Portal:** the server on which your space is available (ex: san-1.rpn.online.net)
    * **Target:** click on the small arrow, and the list of available targets will be displayed (if it is not the case, no need to go further, there is a problem)
    * **Nodes:** the nodes that can access this target
    * **Enable:** check the box
    * **Use LUNs directly:** do not check if you want to create a LVM Group above (recommended, see next step). Check if you want to use the LUN directly
    * **Shared:** Leave the default option 
    * Add the LVM Group (Optional)
    This step only applies if you want to create a LVM Group to store VM images.
3. Click **Add** and then **LVM** or **LVM-Thin**. Fill in the form:
    * **ID:** any identifier to name this LVM Group
    * **Base Storage:** click on the small arrow, and select the previously mounted storage space
    * **Base Volume:** click on the small arrow, and select the line that appears
    * **Volume Group** an identifier of your choice to name the volume group in the system
    * **Nodes** the nodes that will be able to access this space
    * **Enable** check the box

Your RPN SAN is available for use.
