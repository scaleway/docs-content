1. Click **Smart Labeling** in the **AI** section of the side menu. The list of your workspaces displays.

2. Click on the workspace you want to access. The workspace overview displays.

3. Scroll down to the **Delete your labeling workspace** section. 

4. Click **Delete** and type **DELETE** in the pop-up. Then click **Delete this labeling workspace** to permanently delete your workspace.

  <Message type="important">

  Delting your labeling workspace **deletes all your annotations**. Make sure you have exported them, to avoid data loss.

  </Message>

  <Message typ="note">

  Deleting the labeling workspace does **not** delete the associated S3 buckets. To avoid incurring Object Storage costs, it is recommended to delete the buckets separately if you no longer need the data.
