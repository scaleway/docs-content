When the same environment variable is injected by multiple sources, the Scaleway infrastructure follows a precedence rule to determine the value for that variable.

The order of precedence, from highest to lowest is the following.

1. Environment variables defined in your command-line environment.

2. Static variables (i.e. variables set in a [Terraform/OpenTofu configuration file](/terraform/reference-content/scaleway-configuration-file/)).

3. Variables defined in the [Scaleway SDK configuration file](/scaleway-sdk/reference-content/scaleway-configuration-file/) or [Scaleway CLI configuration file](/scaleway-cli/reference-content/scaleway-configuration-file/).
