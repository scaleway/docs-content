Load Balancer now generates logs when the state of backend servers changes, or when your frontend TLS certificates expire. These logs are sent to your Scaleway Cockpit and you can browse them via the dedicated **LB Logs Overview** dashboard. They provide information not only on the changes in state of backend servers, but also the reasons for these changes. With these logs, you will be equipped to properly troubleshoot backend server issues.
