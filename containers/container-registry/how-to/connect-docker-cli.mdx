Docker is a tool that makes it easy to manage container images. You can use Docker to push and pull images to and from your Scaleway Container Registry. We show you how to set up Docker on your local computer to connect to your Container Registry.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your local computer


1. Click **Container Registry** in the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Container Registry namespaces dashboard displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" />, then **Push instructions** next to the namespace you want to push to. A pop-up displays.
3. Copy the push instructions.
4. Open a terminal window on your local computer.
5. Run the following command to log into the namespace:
    ```
    docker login rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/mynamespace -u nologin -p [SCW_SECRET_KEY]
    ```
    <Message type="important">
      Replace `[SCW_SECRET_KEY]` with your [API secret key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) and `mynamespace` with the name of your namespace.
    </Message>

    Once logged in, confirmation is displayed:

    ```
    Login Succeeded
    ```

You are now logged in and ready to push and pull images to and from your Container Registry with Docker.
