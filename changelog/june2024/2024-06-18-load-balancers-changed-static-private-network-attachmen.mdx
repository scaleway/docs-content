Following the deprecation of [static Private Network attachment](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/changelog/?product=load-balancers&status=deprecated#static-attachment-is-no-longer-available/), the Load Balancer API will no longer accept static Private Network attachement with an IP address outside of the Private Network subnet.

Please update to [DHCP attachment type](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/load-balancer/zoned-api/#path-private-networks-attach-a-load-balancer-to-a-private-network/) (recommended) or use an IP address which belongs to the Private Network subnet.

If you already use DHCP attachment mode or static attachement mode with an IP address belonging to the Private Network subnet, you're not affected by this change.
