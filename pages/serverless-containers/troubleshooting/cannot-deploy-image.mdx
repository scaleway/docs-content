## Problem

I am unable to deploy my image using Serverless Containers.

## Possible solutions

- Make sure the container is listening on the specified PORT for HTTP requests (or use variable `$PORT`). Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/serverless-containers/reference-content/port-parameter-variable/) for more information.

- Make sure the container is bound to `0.0.0.0`.

- Containers cannot start due to insufficient provisioned resources. Update your container's resources by provisioning more memory and more vCPU.

- Make sure you have built your image for an `amd64` architecture, as `arm64` is not supported. See the [Architecture](/serverless-containers/reference-content/containers-limitations/#architecture) documentation for more information.

- Make sure your deployment does not exceed the limitations of [Serverless Containers](/serverless-containers/reference-content/containers-limitations/).

  <Message type="tip">
    Run the [`docker inspect`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/inspect/) command to get detailed information on your image:
    ```
    docker inspect myimage
    ```
