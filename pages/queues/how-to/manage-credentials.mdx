Credentials give their bearer (e.g. services and platforms) access to your Queues service. 

This page shows how to manage [credentials](/queues/concepts/#credentials) for Scaleway Queues. Credentials can be updated to change their permissions, or revoked entirely. Once credentials are revoked, any user trying to use the credentials to connect to the service will be denied.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Valid [credentials](/queues/how-to/create-credentials/)

## How to update Queues credentials

1. Click **Queues** in the **Integration Services** section of the Scaleway console side menu.

2. Click the **Credentials** tab.

3. Use the drop-down menu to select the [region](/queues/concepts/#region) containing the credentials you want to update.

4. Click the <Icon name="more" /> button next to the credentials you want to update, and select **Update credentials**. A pop-up displays, such as the one below for Queues:
