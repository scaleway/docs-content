<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net)
  - You have [created](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/order-a-server) a Dedibox dedicated server

All Scaleway Dedibox dedicated servers support IPv6. You can request a free `/48` IPv6 prefix for your account. This prefix can then be divided into multiple `/56` or `/64` subnets. IPv6 is available for Dedibox servers in Paris, Amsterdam, and Warsaw.

1. Click **Server** > **Network configuration** in the Dedibox console. The network configuration page displays.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Order a free /48 IPv6 block**:

The IPv6 prefix is delivered within 30 minutes and is visible on the network configuration page.

<Message type="note">
  You need to have at least one Dedibox dedicated server to order an IPv6 prefix.
</Message>

<Message type="important">
  The DUID of your prefix (and each of its subnets) is like a private key and grants you access to your prefix. Keep it secret and do not share it.
