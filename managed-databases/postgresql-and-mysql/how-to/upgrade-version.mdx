If your Database Instance uses an End of Life engine version versions and is no longer maintained, we recommend that you upgrade your engine version.

3. Make sure that you have read and agree with the conditions of the upgrade. 
    <Message type="note">
        You can currently only upgrade to the next major version. This means that if you have a Database Instance running on PostgreSQL 10, you will be ugraded to PostgreSQL 11. If you want to upgrade to the most recent version of an engine, you must create a new Database Instance and [migrate your databases](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/tutorials/migrate-databases-instance/).
    </Message>
4. Click **Upgrade version**. A new Database Instance is created.
    <Message type="important">
      When you upgrade a version, a clone of your current Database Instance with an up-to-date engine version is created. Your current Database Instance will remain available with its original endpoints, and will still be billed.<br /><br />The new, upgraded Database Instance will have new endpoints. To use it, replace the old endpoints with the new across all your applications. The upgrade does not impact your original Database Instance. Even after manually updating your endpoints, you can roll back to the old ones at any time.

      On PostgreSQL, engine extensions are handled and upgraded automatically during the upgrade process.
