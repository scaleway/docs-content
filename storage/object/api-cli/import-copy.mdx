[Object Storage](https://www.scaleway.com/en/object-storage/) allows you to import a copy of your objects in a bucket to another bucket using the [AWS-CLI](/storage/object/api-cli/object-storage-aws-cli/).

The `sync` command is used to synchronize directories and S3 prefixes. 

This command will: 

- Recurringly copy new and updated files from the source directory to the target one
- Use the `CopyObject` APIs to list objects in the source and target buckets and identify which ones they have in common
- Compare both to determine disparities in `LastModified` dates between the same objects

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />
 
<Message type="note">
  When applied on a versioned bucket, the sync command copies only the most recent version of the objects.

## Importing copied objects from the same project

To import copied objects to a bucket in the same [Project](/console/my-project/quickstart/), use the `aws s3 sync` command.

<Message type="important">
  Before importing a copy, make sure all of the source bucket's objects are in one of the two classes: `STANDARD` or `ONEZONE_IA` (only available in FR-PAR). If an object is in `GLACIER` class, the copy import will fail. To learn how to edit storage classes, refer to this [documentation page](/storage/object/how-to/edit-storage-class).
</Message>

```
aws s3 sync s3://$SourceBucket s3://$TargetBucket
```

Replace `$SourceBucket` with the name of the bucket where the copy is currently stored, and `$TargetBucket` with the name of the bucket the copy will be stored in. 

## Importing copied objects from a different project

To import a copy of objects in a bucket to another bucket in a different [Project](/console/my-project/quickstart/), you need to implement a [bucket policy](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy).

A **bucket policy** is a resource-based policy option. In this context, bucket policies are used to grant the target Project access to the source bucket.

1. Create a file with your bucket policy for the source bucket.
    <Message type="note">
      Bucket policies use a JSON-based access policy language. You can find more details about the JSON policy grammar on [this page](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy).

    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Id":"MyBucketPolicy",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "DelegateS3Access",
                "Effect":"Allow",
                "Principal":{
                    "SCW":"project_id:<TARGET_PROJECT_ID>"
                },
                "Action":[
                    "s3:ListBucket",
                    "s3:GetObject"
                ],
                "Resource":[
                    "<BUCKET_NAME>",
                    "<BUCKET_NAME>/*"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
2. Run the following command:
    ```bash
    $ aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket <SOURCE_BUCKET> --profile <SOURCE_PROJECT> --policy file://bucket-policy.json
    ``` 
3. If necessary, create the target bucket in the target project.
    ```json
    $ aws s3api create-bucket --bucket <TARGET_BUCKET> --profile <TARGET_PROJECT>
    {
      "Location": "/<TARGET_BUCKET>"
    }
    ```
4. Copy objects and import using the `sync` command.
5. Replace `<SOURCE_BUCKET>` with the name of the bucket located in the source project and `<TARGET_BUCKET>` with the name of the bucket in the target project. 
    ```bash
    $ aws s3 sync s3://<SOURCE_BUCKET> s3://<TARGET_BUCKET> --profile <TARGET_PROJECT>
    ```
