You can add nodes and pools to your Kosmos cluster from the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) or by using the [API](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/). Here, we show you how to edit from the console.

  This document concerns the management of a Kosmos cluster. For a Kapsule cluster, refer to the [corresponding documentation for Kapsule](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/edit-cluster)
</Message>

<Message type="important">
  Be aware that nodes from multi-cloud pools cannot benefit from the auto-healing and auto-scaling features of Scaleway Kapsule pool. Since Scaleway does not have access to your other providers' accounts, it is not possible to carry out actions such as automatic deletion, creation,and reboot of external nodes.

## How to add a multi-cloud pool to your Kosmos cluster 

A multi-cloud pool allows you to attach external Instances and servers to your cluster. Instances added to the same pool do not need to share the same configuration, nor do they have to be managed by the same Cloud provider. 

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the Compute section of the side menu. The Kubernetes creation page displays.
2. Click the cluster you want to add a pool to.
3. Click the **Pools** tab.
4. Click the **+ Add a new pool** button. The pool creation wizard displays.
5. Complete the following steps of the wizard:
    * Choose a **pool type**. This can be a Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule Pool or a Kubernetes Multi-Cloud Pool. This document concerns the addition of a Multi-Cloud Pool.

    * A **name** for the pool and optionally a description and tags.
6. Click **Add pool** to finish.

## How to add external nodes to your multi cloud pool

In order to add external nodes to your Multi Cloud Cluster, you must first [create a Multi Cloud Pool](#how-to-add-a-multi-cloud-pool-to-your-kosmos-cluster).

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the Compute section of the side menu. The Kubernetes creation page displays.
2. Click the cluster you want to add external nodes to.
3. Click the **Nodes** tab.
4. Click the **+ Add an external node** button

    The instructions for adding an external node display:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-add-external-node-instr.webp" alt="" />

Connect to the node you want to add to your Kubernetes Kosmos cluster and run the command as described in the instruction panel.

## How to detach nodes from your multi cloud pool

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the Compute section of the side menu. The Kubernetes creation page displays.
2. Click the cluster in question.
3. Click the **Nodes** tab.
4. Click the unlink icon next to the node you want to detach. A pop-up asks you to confirm the action.
5. Click **Detach this node**.
    <Message type="note">
      This action will remove your node from the cluster. Your external node will not be deleted from your other cloud provider account(s).
