Scaleway Messaging and Queuing is a [message broker](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#messaging-and-queuing) tool that allows you to transfer messages between different microservices and platforms. This enables them to "talk" to each other effectively even if they are not otherwise compatible. Messaging and Queuing enables and simplifies microservices application development and allows you to build highly scalable, reliable, distributed applications.

To get started with Scaleway Messaging and Queuing, you need to activate your protocol of choice (SQS or SNS) - or, in the case of the NATS protocol, create a NATS account. You should then generate credentials, and in the case of SQS, use the console to start creating queues. After this, you can then use any supported SDK or CLI of your choice to start creating and managing queues, topics and messages.

This quickstart guide is divided into two sections, depending on the protocol you want to use with Messaging and Queuing (SQS/SNS, or NATS).

## Quickstart for SQS or SNS

### How to activate SQS or SNS

SQS and SNS are handled as two separate protocols. Each one needs to be activated before you can start creating credentials, queues, topics etc for this protocol. You can choose to activate one or both protocols as you like. You can deactivate each protocol at any time.

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The following screen displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-activate-mnq.webp" alt="" />

2. Click **SQS** or **SNS** depending on the protocol you want to activate.

    A message displays prompting you to click a button to activate the protocol. It also reminds you that activating the protocol does not trigger any billing, and that you can deactivate at any time.

3. Click **Activate SQS** (or SNS).

    The protocol is activated, and you are invited to generate credentials.

### How to create credentials for SQS or SNS

Credentials for SQS or SNS are granular: you can define the level of access that they should give.

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of Messaging and Queuing protocols displays.

2. Click the **SQS** or **SNS** depending on which service you want to create credentials for.

3. Click **Generate credentials**. A pop-up displays, such as the following for SQS:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-generate-creds-sqs.webp" alt="" />

4. Enter a name for these credentials.

5. Select the required permissions for the credentials. You must choose at least one of **Write**, **Read** and **Manage**. You are free to select any combination of these permissions.

6. Click **Generate credentials**.

    The credentials are created. The access key and secret key are displayed, and you are invited to copy them.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-sqs-sns-creds-generated.webp" alt="" />
    
    <Message type="important">
      This is your only chance to view and save the secret key. Make sure that you copy it and save it somewhere securely.
    </Message>

5. Copy and save the credentials, before closing the window.

    You are returned to your Messaging and Queuing SQS or SNS service's **Credentials** tab. The name of your newly-generated credentials, along with the access key and access level are displayed.

### How to create queues for SQS

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of Messaging and Queuing protocols displays.

2. Click **SQS**, then **Create queue**.

3. Click the `+` button to create a new queue. The queue creation wizard displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-sqs-queue.webp" alt="" />

4. Choose your **queue type**, from one of the following:
    - **Standard**: Standard queues ensure at-least-once delivery. The exact order of messages in the queue is not preserved.
    - **FIFO**: FIFO queues (**F**irst **In** **F**irst **O**ut) preserves the exact ordering of messages.

5. Enter a **name** for your queue. The name must be no more than 80 characters, and consist only of alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. Alternatively, you can go with the auto-generated name suggested for you.

6. Configure your queue's **parameters**. The following parameters can be defined:
    - **Visibility timeout**: The length of time (in seconds) during which, after a message is received, it is hidden and cannot be received again by the same or other consumers. This is useful as the queue itself does not automatically delete messages once they are received, and so prevents consumers from receiving the same message many times before they have finished processing it. Therefore, the value set here should be informed by the expected length of time it will take consumers to process messages. The default value is 30 seconds. The value must be between 1 second and 43 200 seconds (12 hours).
    - **Message retention period**: The length of time (in seconds) that messages are kept in the queue before being deleted. Setting a longer message retention period allows for a longer interval between a message being sent and it being received. The default value is 60 seconds. The value must be between 60 seconds and 1 290 600 seconds (14 days).
    - **Maximum message size**: The maximum size (in kilobytes) of a message that can be sent to the queue. Messages greater than the defined size will be rejected. The default value is 256 KB. The value must be between 1 KB and 256 KB.
    - **Content Based Deduplication**: This setting is only available for FIFO queues. Enable content based deduplication if the message body is guaranteed to be unique for each message. A unique hash value is generated from the body of each message, which is used as its deduplication ID. This avoids the need to set a deduplication ID when sending messages.

7. Click **Create queue** to finish.

You are returned to the **Queues** tab, where your newly-created queue now displays. You can view its URL here, for use in your API/CLI operations. Go further by clicking on the queue's name to access its **Settings** page and see additional information such as its ARN (Amazon Resource Name) and configuration parameters.

### How to create topics for SNS

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of Messaging and Queuing protocols displays.

2. Click **SNS**, then navigate to the **Topics** tab and click **Create topic**. The topic creation wizard displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-topic.webp" alt="" />

3. Choose a geographical **region** in which to create your SNS topic.

4. Enter a **name** for your topic. The name must contain no more than 80 characters, and consist only of alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. Alternatively, you can go with the auto-generated name suggested for you.

5. Choose a **topic type**, from one of the following:
    - **Standard**: Standard topics ensure at-least-once delivery. The exact order of messages published to the topic is not preserved.
    - **FIFO**: FIFO topics (**F**irst **In** **F**irst **O**ut) preserves the exact ordering of messages. [Content-based deduplication](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#content-based-deduplication) is only available for FIFO topics.

5. Configure your topics's **parameters**. The following parameters can be defined:
    - **Content-based deduplication**: This setting is only available for FIFO topics. Enable content based deduplication to ensure that identical messages are not processed or stored multiple times. You should only enable this setting if the message body is guaranteed to be unique for each message.

6. Click **Create topic** to finish.

You are returned to the **Topics** tab, where your newly-created topic now displays. The topic's URL is also displayed here, for use in your API/CLI operations. 

Go further by clicking on the topic's name to access its **Settings** page and see additional information such as its ARN (Amazon Resource Name) and configuration parameters.

### How to create and manage subscriptions, messages and more

All further actions related to publishing, processing and managing subscriptions, messages, subjects, queues and streams can be done via a supported CLI or SDK. See our documentation on the [SQS CLI and SDKs](/serverless/messaging/reference-content/sqs-overview#further-actions) and [SNS CLI and SDKs](/serverless/messaging/reference-content/sns-overview#further-actions)for more information.

### How to deactivate SQS or SNS

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of Messaging and Queuing protocols displays.

2. Click **SQS** or **SNS** depending on which protocol you want to deactivate.

3. Click the **Settings** tab.

4. In the bottom panel, click the **Deactivate SQS** button.

   A popup displays, reminding you that any existing SQS (or SNS) resources you have will be permanently deleted, and that you will not be able to create any new queues/topics or credentials unless you reactivate the protocol.

5. Click **Deactivate SQS** (or SNS) to confirm.

## Quickstart for NATS

### How to create a NATS account

To start using a NATS message broker, you must first create a NATS account. This sets a scope for your NATS credentials, messages, queues and stream.

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The following screen displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-activate-mnq.webp" alt="" />

2. Click **NATS**. The NATS welcome screen displays.

3. Click **Create a NATS account**. The creation wizard displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-nats-account.webp" alt="" />

4. Complete the following steps in the wizard:

    - Choose a **region**, which is the geographical location in which your NATS account will be created. Currently, only the `PARIS` region is available.
    - Enter a **name** for your NATS account, or use the auto-generated name suggested for you.
    - Optional: Use the *Estimated cost** calculator to simulate how messages sent and stored with NATS streams will be billed. Note that simply creating a NATS account does not in itself incur any billing. For more information about NATS billing, see the [FAQ](/faq/messaging-and-queuing/). 
    - Click **Create NATS account** to finish

    You are directed to the listing of your NATS accounts, where your newly-created NATS account now appears.

### How to create credentials for a NATS account

Credentials for NATS accounts are not granular: they necessarily give full read and write access. The bearer of these credentials can publish and receive messages, as well as manage topics and streams, for this account.

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of Messaging and Queuing protocols displays.

2. Click **NATS**. The list of your NATS accounts displays.

3. Click the NATS account you want to generate credentials for. The account's **Overview** page displays.

4. In the **Credentials** panel, click **Generate credentials**. A pop-up displays.
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-generate-nats-creds.webp" alt="" />

5. Enter a name for these credentials, and click **Generate credentials**.

    The credentials are created and a button displays prompting you to download them in a `.creds` file. 

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-nats-cred-generated.webp" alt="" />
    
    <Message type="important">
      The generated credentials are displayed only once. Make sure to download and safely store them before closing the window.
    </Message>

6. Click **Download** and save the file, before closing the window.

    You are returned to your namespace's overview page. The name of your newly-generated credentials and their access level is displayed in the **Credentials** panel.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-nats-credentials-display.webp" alt="" />


### How to create and manage queues, messages and streams

All further actions related to publishing, processing and managing messages, subjects, queues and streams can be done via a supported CLI or SDK. See our documentation on [NATS CLI and SDKs](/serverless/messaging/reference-content/nats-overview#further-actions:-nats-cli-and-nats-sdk) for more information.

### How to delete a NATS account

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the Scaleway console side menu. The list of Messaging and Queuing protocols displays.

2. Click **NATS**, then click the NATS account you want to delete.

3. In the bottom panel, click the **Delete NATS account** button.

    A popup displays, reminding you that the action is irreversible, and any associated queued messages and credentials will be deleted.
