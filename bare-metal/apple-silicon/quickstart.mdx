## How to connect to your Mac mini

### How to connect via remote desktop

You can access your Mac mini using VNC, a remote desktop-sharing protocol. It allows you to visualize the graphical screen output of a remote computer and transfer local keyboard and mouse events to the remote computer using a network connection.

Refer to our detailed documentation for Windows, Linux, and macOS for OS specific information: [How to access the remote desktop of a Mac mini](/bare-metal/apple-silicon/how-to/access-remote-desktop-mac-mini/).

## How to connect using SSH

1. Navigate to the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) and log in with your credentials.
2. Click **Apple silicon** under the **Bare Metal** section in the side-menu. This displays a list of your Mac minis.
3. Click the name of the Mac mini you want to connect to. The **Overview** page for your selected Mac mini displays.
4. Open your terminal application and use the SSH command provided on the **Overview** page to connect.
   - The SSH command will be in the format:
     ```sh
     ssh your_mac_mini_username@<your_mac_mini_ip>
     ```
   - Replace `<your_mac_mini_username>` with your Mac mini username.
   - Replace `<your_mac_mini_ip>` with the actual IP address of your Mac mini.


## How to delete a Mac mini

1. Click **Apple silicon** in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu. A list of your Mac minis displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the Mac mini you want to delete and select **Delete** from the drop-down menu. A pop-up asks you to confirm the action.
3. Type **DELETE** and then click **Delete Mac mini**.

You are returned to the list of your Mac minis, where the machine you deleted no longer appears.
