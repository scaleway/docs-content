This page shows how to create a Scaleway Web Hosting plan. Web Hosting is a managed service, designed for personal use, business use and everything in between. It allows you to host your website and databases and create personalized email addresses using your domain name.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Registered a domain name](/domains-and-dns/how-to/register-internal-domain/) at Scaleway or another registrar

1. Click **Web Hosting** in the **Domains & Web Hosting** section of the side menu. This takes you to the Web Hosting dashboard.<br />
   If you already have Web Hosting plans, they will be listed. Click the **+ Order Web Hosting** button to add more plans.
2. Click the **Region** drop-down and select a region in which to order a Web Hosting plan.
3. Click **Order Web Hosting** to start the creation process.
