Once you have finished your inference tasks, you can delete your deployment. This page explains how to do so from the Scaleway console.

<Requirements />

  - A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - A [Managed Inference deployment](/managed-inference/quickstart/)
  - [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

1. Click **Managed Inference** in the **AI** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. A list of your deployments displays.
2. From the drop-down menu, select the geographical region you want to manage.
3. Choose a deployment by clicking its name. The deployment's **Overview** page displays.
4. Navigate to the **Settings** tab.
5. Click **Delete deployment** at the bottom of the page.
6. Type **DELETE** to confirm and click **Delete deployment**.

  Alternatively, from the Deployments listing, click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the deployment name you no longer need, and click **Delete**. A pop-up appears. Type **DELETE** to confirm, then click **Delete deployment**.
