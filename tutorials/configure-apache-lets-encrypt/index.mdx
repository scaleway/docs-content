## Let's Encrypt Overview

[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is a certificate authority providing free SSL certificates. The creation, validation, installation is automated with certbot â€” all major browsers trust certificates issued by Let's Encrypt.

In this tutorial you will learn how to create a website for Apache to serve, then secure the Apache web server on Ubuntu Bionic Beaver with a Let's Encrypt certificate using certbot.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have [created an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/)
- You have a domain name pointing towards your Instance's IP address (via an A or AAAA record)
- You have [configured your SSH key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key)
- You have sudo privileges or access to the root user.

## Installing Apache

1. [Connect to your Instance via SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/), and update the software already installed:

  ```
  apt update
  apt upgrade -y
  ```

2. Install the Apache web server:

  ```
  apt install apache2
  ```

3. Create a directory for the website. In this tutorial we use `myweb.example.com`. Replace it with your domain name whenever you see it:

  ```
  mkdir -p /var/www/html/myweb.example.com/public_html
  ```

4. Create an index page for the website by running the following command:

  ```
  nano /var/www/html/myweb.example.com/public_html/index.html
  ```

  Then, copy the following content into the file, save it and exit nano:

  ```
  <html>
  <head>
  <title>myweb.example.com</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  <h1>New Website</h1>
  <p>This is the new website of myweb.exaple.com</p>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```

5. Create a configuration file for the website, by making a copy of the default configuration:

  ```
  cp /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/myweb.example.com.conf
  ```

6. Open the file in a text editor:

  ```
  nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/myweb.example.com.conf
  ```

  Edit the following lines to match your configuration, add them to the file, save it and exit the editor:

  ```
  ServerAdmin webmaster@myweb.example.com
  ServerName myweb.example.com
  ServerAlias www.myweb.example.com
  DocumentRoot /var/www/html/myweb.example.com/public_html
  ```

  Once edited the file should look like this example:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-config_apache.webp" alt="" />

7. Activate the new site:

  ```
  a2ensite myweb.example.com
  ```

8. Reload the Apache configuration to enable the new site:

  ```
  systemctl reload apache2.service
  ```

## Installing Certbot

Install Certbot via apt:

  ```
  apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache -y
  ```

## Running Certbot

1. Run Certbot to request a certificate for the domain name:

  ```
  certbot --apache
  ```

  Certbot will ask you a series of questions:

    - Firstly, Certbot asks for your email address. Enter it and press `Enter` on your keyboard.
    - You will then be asked to agree to the terms of service. Do so by pressing `Y`.
    - Decide if you want to share your email address with the [Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)](https://www.eff.org/). Press `Y` for yes or `N` for no.
    - Next, you will be asked for which domains you want to activate SSL. Select the appropriate numbers separated by commas and/or spaces, or leave input blank to select all options shown.
    - Certbot asks if all traffic should be forced to HTTPS. Type `1` for no or `2` for yes.
    - The certificate is requested and the following message appears once it has been obtained:

    ```
    Congratulations! You have successfully enabled https://myweb.example.com

    You should test your configuration at:
    https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=myweb.example.com
    ```

2. Verify the certificate by opening your site in a web browser:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-ssl_enabled.webp" alt="" />

The small padlock icon indicates that the connection to your Instance is now encrypted.
