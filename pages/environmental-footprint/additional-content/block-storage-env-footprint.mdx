This page includes the specificities of the environmental footprint calculation for Block Storage.

## Calculation aspects

The total estimated impact of Block Storage volumes is calculated by integrating the:

- **Manufacturing impact** - Related to the physical servers hosting the storage volumes.
- **Usage Impact** - The impact of the tools used to manage the Block Storage offers: control plane, monitoring, internal load balancers, and others.
- **Energy usage impact** - The average electricity consumption of storage servers and their energy efficiency.

### Ratio per storage volume

To allocate the impact of a Block Storage volume, we apply the unit resulting from the RCP allocation rule to all calculation steps, the `bls_ration`:

```
VOLsto/VolstoPool = bls_ratio
```

- **VOLsto** - represents the **reserved volume** per user. In Block Storage, your data is replicated three times on multiple nodes to guarantee availability, so the **VOLsto** is applied with factor of 3 to account for replication.
- **VolstoPool** - represents all the storage for Block Storage volumes on the server that hosts them (around 60%).

### Manufacturing impact

The manufacturing impact of Block Storage volumes is attributed based on the servers that host the storage.

Considering a server with a lifespan of 6 years (52 560 hours) and power of 110w, for 100 hours and considering via Boavizta estimates that the impact of the manufacturing of this server is 850 kgCo2e, and a `bls_ratio` of  we can make the following calculation:

```
VolumeManufacturingImpact = (100 / 52560) * 850 * bls_ratio = [À REMPLIR] kgCO2e
```

### Usage impact

The calculation of the impact of cross-IT equipments takes into consideration the manufacturing and usage impacts of both the control and data plane of the internal Scaleway infrastructure for Block Storage.

- **Control Plane** - Calculate impact as done for Apple Silicon product VMs - hardware and vms
- **Data Plane** - Calculate manufacturing impact via [Boavizta](https://www.boavizta.org/), retrieve electricity consumption estimation and multiply by PUE and energy mix

*   The allocation is done **based on electrical power**: we need to retrieve the electrical power dedicated to Block Storage:
    *   Retrieval of the estimation of the electricity consumption of the Block Storage servers –> [Handbook](https://handbook.scaleway.com/) (static data, like for Elastic Metal).
    *   Retrieval of the **quantities of hardware of the Data plane**.
    *   We add the **electricity consumption of the Control Plane VMs**.

To calculate the usage, we consider the French energy mix and the datacenter's PUE. In this example, they are O,056kgCo2e/kwh and 1,16, respectively. Which results in:

```math
UsageFootprint = 0,110 x 100 x 0,056 x 1,16 = 0,715 kgCo2e
```
