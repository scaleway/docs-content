NVIDIA Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) is a technology introduced by NVIDIA to enhance the utilization and flexibility of their data center GPUs, specifically designed for virtualization and multi-tenant environments.
It allows a single physical GPU to be partitioned into up to seven smaller Instances, each of which operates as an independent GPU Instance with its own dedicated resources, such as memory, compute cores, and video outputs.
MIG ensures one client cannot impact the work or scheduling of other clients, in addition to providing enhanced isolation for customers.

With MIG, you are able to see and schedule jobs on virtual GPU Instances as if they were physical GPUs. MIG works with Linux operating systems, supports containers using Docker Engine, with support for Kubernetes and virtual machines using hypervisors such as Red Hat Virtualization and VMware vSphere.

Moreover the following benefits are part of MIG:

* **Resource Sharing:** It allows multiple users or workloads to share a single physical GPU, which can lead to better resource utilization and cost savings.

* **Complete isolation:** Each MIG Instance is isolated from the others, ensuring that workloads running in one Instance do not interfere with or impact the performance of workloads in other Instances. With MIG, each GPU Instance's processors have separate and isolated paths through the entire memory system - the on-chip crossbar ports, L2 cache banks, memory controllers, and DRAM address busses are all assigned uniquely to an individual Instance.

* **Guaranteed resosources**: MIG Instances can be configured with specific resource allocations, providing dedicated performance to different workloads. This is especially important in multi-tenant environments.
