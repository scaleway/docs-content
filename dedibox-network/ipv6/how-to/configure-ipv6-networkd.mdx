  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net)
  - You have [created](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/order-a-server) a Dedibox dedicated server
  - You have [requested](/dedibox-network/ipv6/how-to/request-prefix) a /48 IPv6 prefix
</Message>


`networkd` is the network manager of [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) and can be used as an alternative to the configuration of IPv6 using a [standalone DHCP client](/dedibox-network/ipv6/how-to/configure-ipv6-linux).

<Message type="tip">
  When specifying the IP address of your Dedibox, you need to enter it in [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing). The netmask for the main IP of a Dedibox server is `/24`, the netmask for a failover IP is `/32`.

1. To configure `networkd`, start by creating a backup of the current network configuration:
    ```
    sudo mv /etc/network/interfaces /etc/network/interfaces.backup
    ```
2. Enable `networkd` by using the systemctl command. Do not start the service yet, as the server is currently still running on the old configuration and may become unreachable if networkd is started at this step.
    ```
    systemctl enable systemd-networkd.service
    ```
3. Create a new file called `dummy0.netdev` in the `/etc/systemd/network` directory and open it in a text editor, i.e. `nano`.
    ```
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/network/dummy0.netdev
    ```
4. Copy the following content into the file, save it, and exit the text editor:
    ```
    [NetDev]
    Name=dummy0
    Kind=dummy
    ```
5. Create a new file `dummy0.network` and open it in nano:
    ```
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/network/dummy0.network
    ```
6. Copy the following content into the file, save it and exit the text editor:
    ```
    [Match]
    Name=dummy0
    [Network]
    IPv6PrefixDelegation=dhcpv6
    ```
7. Find the name of your public Internet interface using the `ip link show` command. In this example, the name of the interface is `enp1s0f0`. Take a note of it, as it will be required in the next steps.
8. Create a new file called `<interface_name>.network` and open it in a text editor
    ```
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/network/enp1s0f0.network
    ```
9. Copy the following content in the file, edit it towards your configuration before saving the file and exiting the text editor.
    ```
    [Match]
    #The name must correspond to your interface name
    Name=enp1s0

    [Network]
    DHCP=ipv6
    IPv6AcceptRA=True
    # IPv4 of the Dedibox
    Address=<ip_of_your_dedibox>/<netmask>
    # IPv6 of the Dedibox
    Address=<your_ipv6_address>/<netmask>

    [Route]
    # The gateway is either your dedibox ip ending on .1 (i.e. x.y.z.1) for the physical host or 62.210.0.1 for any VM running on a Dedibox
    Gateway=<gateway_ip>
    GatewayOnlink=yes

    [DHCP]
    ClientIdentifier=duid-only
    DUIDType=link-layer
    # Onine by Scaleway DUID without 00:03 at the begginnig
    DUIDRawData=<Online by Scaleway DUID>
    ForceDHCPv6PDOtherInformation=yes

    [IPv6AcceptRA]
    UseOnLinkPrefix=False
    UseAutonomousPrefix=False
    ```
10. Reboot the machine to activate the new configuration.
    ```
    sudo reboot
    ```
