## Product integration into Cockpit

The following table provides details about the products that are integrated into Cockpit. This means that you can have metrics and/or logs and/or alerts in your Cockpit for the products mentioned below.
This also means that if products are **not integrated into Cockpit**, the resources' metrics and logs are **not free of charge**.

Refer to our [documentation on understanding Cockpit usage and pricing](/observability/cockpit/reference-content/understanding-cockpit-usage/) for more information on how to reduce extra costs.

<Message type="important">
 - Having the default configuration on your agents might lead to more of your resources' metrics being sent, a high consumption and a high bill at the end of the month.
 - Sending metrics and logs for Scaleway resources or personal data using an external path is a billable feature. In addition, any data that you push yourself is billed, even if you send data from Scaleway products. Refer to the [product pricing](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/?tags=available,managedservices-observability-cockpit) for more information.
