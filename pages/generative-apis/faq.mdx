## Overview

### What are Scaleway Generative APIs?
Scaleway's Generative APIs provide access to pre-configured, serverless endpoints of leading AI models, hosted in European data centers. This allows you to integrate advanced AI capabilities into your applications without managing underlying infrastructure.

### What is the difference between Generative APIs and Managed Inference?
- **Generative APIs**: A serverless service providing access to pre-configured AI models via API, billed per token usage.
- **Managed Inference**: Allows deployment of curated or custom models with chosen quantization and Instances, offering predictable throughput and enhanced security features like private network isolation and access control. Managed Inference is billed by hourly usage, whether provisioned capacity is receiving traffic or not.

### How do I get started with Generative APIs?
To get started, explore the [Generative APIs Playground](/generative-apis/quickstart/#start-with-the-generative-apis-playground) in the Scaleway console. For application integration, refer to our [Quickstart guide](/generative-apis/quickstart/), which provides step-by-step instructions on accessing, configuring, and using a Generative APIs endpoint.

## Offering and availability

### Where are the inference servers located?
All models are currently hosted in a secure data center located in Paris, France, operated by [OPCORE](https://www.opcore.com/). This ensures low latency for European users and compliance with European data privacy regulations.

### Which models are supported by Generative APIs?
Our Generative APIs support a range of popular models, including:
- Chat / Text Generation models: Refer to our dedicated [documentation](/generative-apis/reference-content/supported-models/#chat-models) for a list of supported chat models.
- Vision models: Refer to our dedicated [documentation](/generative-apis/reference-content/supported-models/#vision-models) for a list of supported vision models.
- Embedding models: Refer to our dedicated [documentation](/generative-apis/reference-content/supported-models/#embedding-models) for a list of supported embedding models.

### What is the model lifecycle for Generative APIs?
Scaleway is dedicated to updating and offering the latest versions of generative AI models, while ensuring older models remain accessible for a significant time, and also ensuring the reliability of your production applications. Learn more in our [model lifecycle policy](/generative-apis/reference-content/model-lifecycle/).

## Pricing and billing

### How does the free tier work?
The free tier allows you to process up to 1,000,000 tokens without incurring any costs. After reaching this limit, you will be charged per million tokens processed. Free tier usage is calculated by adding all input and output tokens consumed by all models used.
For more information, refer to our [pricing page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/model-as-a-service/#generative-apis) or access your bills by token types and models in the [billing section from Scaleway Console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elementsbilling/payment) (past and provisional bills for the current month).

Note that when your consumption exceeds the free tier, you will be billed for each additional token consumed by the model and token type. The minimum billing unit is 1 million tokens. Here are two examples of low volume consumption:

Example 1: Free Tier only

| Model | Token type | Tokens consumed | Price | Bill |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `llama-3.3-70b-instruct`  | Input | 500k  | €0.90/million tokens | €0.00  |
| `llama-3.3-70b-instruct`  | Output | 200k  | €0.90/million tokens | €0.00  |
| `mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct-2503`  | Input | 100k  | €0.15/million tokens | €0.00  |
| `mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct-2503`  | Output | 100k  | €0.35/million tokens | €0.00  |

Total tokens consumed: `900k`
Total bill: `0.00€`

Example 2: Exceeding Free Tier

| Model | Token type | Tokens consumed | Price | Billed consumption | Bill |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `llama-3.3-70b-instruct`  | Input | 800k  | €0.90/million tokens | 1 million tokens | €0.00  (Free Tier application)|
| `llama-3.3-70b-instruct`  | Output | 2 500k  | €0.90/million tokens | 3 million tokens | €2.70  |
| `mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct-2503`  | Input | 100k  | €0.15/million tokens | 1 million tokens | €0.15  |
| `mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct-2503`  | Output | 100k  | €0.35/million tokens | 1 million tokens | €0.35  |

Total tokens consumed: `900k`
Total billed consumption: `6 million tokens`
Total bill: `€3.20`

Note that in this example, the first line where the free tier applies will not display in your current Scaleway bills by model, but will instead be listed under `Generative APIs Free Tier - First 1M tokens for free`.

### What are tokens, and how are they counted?
A token is the minimum unit of content that is seen and processed by a model. Hence, token definitions depend on input types:
- For text, on average, `1` token corresponds to `~4` characters, and thus `0.75` words (as words are on average five characters long)
- For images, `1` token corresponds to a square of pixels. For example, `mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct-2503` model image tokens are `28x28` pixels (28-pixels height, and 28-pixels width, hence `784` pixels in total).
- For audio:
  - `1` token corresponds to a duration of time. For example, `voxtral-small-24b-2507` model audio tokens are `80` milliseconds.
  - Some models process audio in chunks having a minimum duration. For example, `voxtral-small-24b-2507` model process audio in `30` second chunks. This means audio lasting `13` seconds will be considered `375` tokens (`30` seconds / `0.08` seconds). And audio lasting `178` seconds will be considered `2 250` tokens (`30` seconds * `6` / `0.08` seconds).

The exact token count and definition depend on the [tokenizer](https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/en/chapter2/4) used by each model. When this difference is significant (such as for image processing), you can find detailed information in each model's documentation (for instance in [`mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct-2503` size limit documentation](/managed-inference/reference-content/model-catalog/#mistral-small-31-24b-instruct-2503)). When the model is open, you can also find this information in the model files on platforms such as Hugging Face, usually in the `tokenizer_config.json` file.

### How can I monitor my token consumption?
You can see your token consumption in [Scaleway Cockpit](/cockpit/). You can access it from the Scaleway console under the [Metrics tab](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elementsgenerative-api/metrics).
Note that:
- Cockpits are isolated by Project, hence you first need to select the right Project in the Scaleway console before accessing Cockpit to see your token consumption for this Project (you can see the `project_id` in the Cockpit URL: `https://{project_id}.dashboard.obs.fr-par.scw.cloud/`).
- Cockpit graphs can take up to 1 hour to update token consumption. See [Troubleshooting](/generative-apis/troubleshooting/fixing-common-issues/#tokens-consumption-is-not-displayed-in-cockpit-metrics) for further details.

### Can I configure a maximum billing threshold?
Currently, you cannot configure a specific threshold after which your usage will be blocked. However:
- You can [configure billing alerts](/billing/how-to/use-billing-alerts/) to ensure you are warned when you hit specific budget thresholds.
- Your total billing remains limited by the amount of tokens you can consume within [rate limits](/generative-apis/reference-content/rate-limits/).
- If you want to ensure fixed billing, you can use [Managed Inference](https://www.scaleway.com/en/inference/), which provides the same set of OpenAI-compatible APIs and a wider range of models.

### How can I give access to token consumption to my users outside Scaleway?
If your users do not have a Scaleway account, you can still give them access to their Generative API usage consumption by either:

- Providing them with access to Grafana inside [Cockpit](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elementscockpit/overview). You can create dedicated [Grafana users](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elementscockpit/users) with read-only access (**Viewer** Role). Note that these users will still have access to all other Cockpit dashboards for this project.
- Collecting consumption data from the [Billing API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/billing/#path-consumption-get-monthly-consumption) and exposing it to your users. Consumption can be detailed by Projects.
- Collecting consumption data from [Cockpit data sources](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elementscockpit/dataSource) and exposing it to your users. As an example, you can query consumption using the following query:
```curl
curl -G 'https://{data-source-id}.metrics.cockpit.fr-par.scw.cloud/prometheus/api/v1/query_range' \
    --data-urlencode 'query=generative_apis_tokens_total{resource_name=~".*",type=~"(input_tokens|output_tokens)"}' \
    --data-urlencode 'start=2025-03-15T20:10:51.781Z' \
    --data-urlencode 'end=2025-03-20T20:10:51.781Z' \
    --data-urlencode 'step=1h' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $COCKPIT_TOKEN" | jq
```
Make sure that you replace the following values:
- `data-source-id`: ID of your [Scaleway metrics data source](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elementscockpit/dataSource)
- `$COCKPIT_TOKEN`: your [Cockpit token](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elementscockpit/tokens)
- `start` and `end` time properties: your specific time range

You can see your token consumption in [Scaleway Cockpit](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elementscockpit/). You can access it from the Scaleway console under the [Metrics tab](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elementsgenerative-api/metrics).
Note that:
- Cockpits are isolated by Projects. You first need to select the right Project in the Scaleway console before accessing Cockpit to see your token consumption for the desired Project (you can see the `project_id` in the Cockpit URL: `https://{project_id}.dashboard.obs.fr-par.scw.cloud/`).
- Cockpit graphs can take up to 1 hour to update token consumption. See [Troubleshooting](/generative-apis/troubleshooting/fixing-common-issues/#tokens-consumption-is-not-displayed-in-cockpit-metrics) for further details.

## Specifications

### What are the SLAs applicable to Generative APIs?
We are currently working on defining our SLAs for Generative APIs. We will provide more information on this topic soon.

### What are the performance guarantees (vs Managed Inference)?
We are currently working on defining our performance guarantees for Generative APIs. We will provide more information on this topic soon.

## Quotas and limitations

### Are there any rate limits for API usage?
Yes, API rate limits define the maximum number of requests a user can make within a specific time frame to ensure fair access and resource allocation between users. If you require increased rate limits, we recommend either:
- Using [Managed Inference](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elementsinference/deployments), which provides dedicated capacity and doesn't enforce rate limits (you remain limited by the total provisioned capacity)
- Contacting your existing Scaleway account manager or our Sales team to discuss volume commitment for specific models that will allow us to increase your quota proportionally.

Refer to our dedicated [documentation](/generative-apis/reference-content/rate-limits/) for more information on rate limits.

### Can I increase maximum output (completion) tokens for a model?
No, you cannot increase maximum output tokens above [limits for each model](/generative-apis/reference-content/supported-models/) in Generative APIs.
These limits are in place to protect you against:
- Long generation, which may end by an HTTP timeout. Limits are designed to ensure a model will send its HTTP response in less than 5 minutes.
- Uncontrolled billing, as several models are known to be able to enter infinite generation loops (specific prompts can make the model generate the same sentence over and over, without stopping at all).
If you require higher maximum output tokens, you can use [Managed Inference](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elementsinference/deployments), where these limits do not apply (as your bill will be limited to the size of your deployment).

## Compatibility and integration

### Can I use OpenAI libraries and APIs with Scaleway's Generative APIs?
Yes, Scaleway's Generative APIs are designed to be compatible with OpenAI libraries and SDKs, including the OpenAI Python client library and LangChain SDKs. This allows for seamless integration with existing workflows.

## Usage and management

### Do model licenses apply when using Generative APIs?
Yes, you need to comply with model licenses when using Generative APIs. Applicable licenses are available for [each model in our documentation](/generative-apis/reference-content/supported-models/#vision-models) and in the console Playground.

## Privacy and security

### Where can I find the privacy policy regarding Generative APIs?
