## Container image

A container image is a file that includes all the requirements and instructions of a complete and executable version of an application. 
When running a job, the selected image will be pulled to execute your workload. Images can come from public external registries or from the [Scaleway Container Registry](/containers/container-registry/concepts/#container-registry).

## Environment variables

An environment variable is a variable whose value is set outside the program, typically through functionality built into the operating system. An environment variable is made up of a name/value pair, and any number may be created and available for reference at a point in time.

## Ephemeral storage

In addition to CPU and RAM, Serverless Jobs also provide a storage volume for the duration of the task. This storage space allows to hold the data retrieved by the job, and disappears once the execution is complete.

## GB-s

Unit used to measure the resource consumption of a container. It reflects the amount of memory consumed over time.

## Job

Serverless Jobs is a fully managed solution that enables you to plan, schedule, queue and run batch processing workloads without worrying about provisioning and scaling. A job is a single instance of one of these batch processing workloads.

## Job definition

A Job definition is a template for a Serverless Job. It contains all the information necessary to run the job, including the container image used, the resources allocated, and the command to execute. The definition acts as a blueprint for [job runs](#job-run).

## Job name

The name of a job is part of the [job definition](#job-definition) and is used for informational purposes only.

## Job run

A job run is the execution of a job definition. It can be in a running, succeeded, canceled, or failed status. Each job run has a unique identifier and can be individually monitored using [Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/quickstart/).

## Maximum duration

The maximum duration option allows you to define the maximum execution time before your job is automatically killed.

## Schedule (cron)

A schedule (cron) is a mechanism used to automatically start a Serverless Job at a specific time on a recurring schedule. It works similarly to a traditional Linux cron job, using the `* * * * *` format. Refer to our [cron schedules reference](/serverless/jobs/reference-content/cron-schedules/) for more information.

## Startup command

This optional field allows you to specify a custom command executed upon starting your job if your container image does not have one already, or if you use a public container image.

## vCPU-s

Unit used to measure the resource consumption of a container. It reflects the amount of vCPU used over time.
