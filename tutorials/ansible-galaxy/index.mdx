In this tutorial we show you how to use Ansible Galaxy. Ansible Galaxy is a tool that seeks to give visibility to one of Ansible's most exciting features: reusable roles for server configuration or the installation of applications. Many users share roles on [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/home).

Ansible roles consist of playbooks that group multiple tasks into one container. They allow the performance of automation tasks with clean directory structures.

## Creating a LAMP server with Ansible roles

To use roles in Ansible playbooks, you must first download them.

1. Install Apache, MySQL and PHP. 
    ```
    ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.apache geerlingguy.mysql geerlingguy.php
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      In this example we use `geerlinguy`'s role, which is a software developer involved in many open source development communities. The latest version will be dowloaded if you do not specify which one you want to download. Add the version after the role name to specify a version. Example: `geerlingguy.apache,1.0.0` or `geerlingguy.mysql,1.0.0`. 
      
      If you want to use other roles, check out [geerlinguy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy)'s Ansible profile.

    </Message>
2. Create an Ansible playbook named `lamp.yml` with the following contents:
    ```
    ---
      - hosts: all
        roles:
          - geerlingguy.mysql
          - geerlingguy.apache
          - geerlingguy.php
    ```
3. Run the playbook against a host
    ```
    ansible-playbook lamp.yml
    ```

The LAMP server is now created.

## Creating a Solr server with Ansible roles

Apache Solr is a fast open-source Java search server. Solr enables you to easily create search engines that search websites, databases and files.

  For more information on Solr, refer to the [Solr official documentation](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/news.html).
</Message>

1. Install Java, tomcat6, Solr with an ansible-galaxy command. We will use the role from `geerlinguy` who is a software developer involved in many open source development communities. Check [geerlinguy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy) for many other roles.
    ```
    ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.java geerlingguy.tomcat6 geerlingguy.solr
    ```
2. Create a playbook named `solr.yml` with the following contents:
    ```
      ---
      - hosts: all
        roles:
          - geerlingguy.java
          - geerlingguy.tomcat6
          - geerlingguy.solr
    ```
3. Run the playbook against a host
    ```
    ansible-playbook solr.yml
    ```

The Solr server is now created. 

## Helpful Galaxy commands

Some other helpful `ansible-galaxy` commands are:

  - `ansible-galaxy list` displays a list of installed roles, with version numbers
  - `ansible-galaxy remove [role]` removes an installed role
  - `ansible-galaxy init` can be used to create a role template suitable for submission to Ansible Galaxy

Additionally, you can configure the default path where Ansible roles are downloaded by editing your `ansible.cfg` configuration file (normally located in `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`) and setting a roles_path in the [defaults] section.

For more information on Galaxy commands, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.4/ansible-galaxy.html#actions).
