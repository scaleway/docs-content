We have expanded our environmental transparency coverage! 

You can now see estimated carbon (Co2) impact metrics for both Block Storage and Object Storage directly in the Scaleway console before ordering a product.

This integration allows you to make informed decisions to optimize the sustainability of your full-stack infrastructure.

Visible now in the **Object storage** and **Block storage** sections and also in our **Product Catalog API**.
