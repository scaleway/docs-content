It is important to unmount (detach) a device from the operating system using the `umount` command to avoid data loss before [removing the Block Storage volume](/storage/block/how-to/detach-a-volume/) from the machine.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your SSH key](/console/project/how-to/create-ssh-key)

1. Connect to your Instance with `ssh`.
    ```
    ssh root@<your_instance_ip>
    ```
2. Unmount the volume to remove it from your current setup.
    ```
    root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# umount /mnt/block-volume
    ```
3.  Check that the volume is no longer mounted in the system with `lsblk`.
    ```
    root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# lsblk
    NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    sda       8:0    0 23.3G  0 disk
    vda     252:0    0 18.6G  0 disk
    ├─vda1  252:1    0 18.5G  0 part /
    └─vda15 252:15   0  100M  0 part /boot/efi
    ```

      Do not forget to edit the `/etc/fstab` file and delete the line corresponding to your block volume.

If you want to mount the same volume elsewhere, make sure you change the mount point.
Refer to the [How to mount and use a block volume](/storage/block/how-to/mount-and-use-volume/) page for more information.
