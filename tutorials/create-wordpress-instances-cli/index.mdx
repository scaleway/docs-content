WordPress is a popular, free and open source blogging tool and a content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL.

Working with the WordPress application will significantly save you time and effort as WordPress is installed and configured. 

The new Wordpress image will be updated on a regular basis to be as close as possible to the latest release. 

## Auto-install functionality

The Wordpress image comes with a new `auto-install` functionality which allows you to create a Wordpress Instance with a few well-defined tags. 
Tags allow you to provide basic information needed to have a fully working Wordpress Instance. 

To trigger the auto-install functionality, two mandatory tags are required for full automation: 

 - `admin_user_name`
 - `admin_email`


Optional tags such as `weblog_title`and `language` can also be used to add more customization to the Weblog. A random password will be generated and will be accessible when you log into your Instance with SSH.
