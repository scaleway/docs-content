## First steps

### How can I create an image?

You must [create at least one snapshot](/compute/instances/how-to/create-a-snapshot/) before creating an image.

See the documentation on [creating an image from scratch](/compute/instances/how-to/create-image-from-snapshot/).


### What is ImageHub?

Scaleway’s ImageHub is a catalog of system images that allow you to deploy, manage, and scale your favorite applications in seconds using image templates.


### What is a Marketplace image?

A Marketplace is an online store that offers applications and services either built on or integrated with Scaleway’s offerings.

Scaleway Marketplace provides information related to Instance images through variants named “local-images”. This information can include the Instance zone and identification, along with constraints regarding the applicable Instance types.

When you want to create an Instance using an image in the Instance [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/), you need to specify the local-image UUID matching the zone and Instance type constraints you fetch from the marketplace API.

Use the [Marketplace API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/marketplace/) to find the UUID of the image you want to use. Alternatively, you can use this CLI command:

  ```
  scw marketplace image get label=image_name
  ```

Replace `image_name` with the name of your image or distribution, e.g.: `ubuntu_focal` or `debian_stretch`.


## Billing

### How am I billed for my compute Instances?

Instances are billed on a pay-as-you-go basis, and their prices are made up of three parts:

* Instance price,
* Storage price (local or block),
* Flexible IP price.

You can change the storage type and flexible IP after the Instance creation, which may affect the monthly billing.


### What are the prices for Instances?

<Message type="note">
  * Prices indicated below do not include storage or IP.

| Product           | All regions*           | PAR3              |
|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Local storage     | €0.000044 GB/hour      | Not available     |
| Local snapshot    | €0.000044 GB/hour      | Not available     |
| Block Storage     | €0.000118 GB/hour      | €0.000177 GB/hour |
| Block snapshot    | €0.000044 GB/hour      | €0.000066 GB/hour |

*All regions include `PAR1`, `PAR2`, `AMS1`, `AMS2`, `AMS3`, `WAW1`, `WAW2`, and `WAW3`. `PAR3` prices are shown separately.


### How much does a flexible IP cost?

Each Instance’s flexible IPv4 costs €0.004/hour, excl. VAT.


## Requirements and configurations

### What is the minimum volume size my Instance can have?

Your **system volume** must be at least 10 GB (125 GB for a GPU OS).


### What are the benefits of Dedicated Resources?

Dedicated Resources give you a more stable experience for compute-demanding workloads, offering benefits such as:
* No “noisy neighbors”,
* No “burst effects”,
* Optimization for demanding and specific needs.


### Which options are available to power off my Instance?

You can choose between four options when powering off your Instance:
* **Hard reboot**: Your Instance performs an electrical reboot and its data is kept on the local storage. We recommend always rebooting your Instance from the OS to avoid data corruption.
* **Power off**: All local volume data is transferred to a volume store, and your physical node is released back to the pool of available machines. The process duration depends on the amount of data archived.
* **Terminate**: Your Instance and its volumes are permanently deleted, but the attached flexible IP is preserved.
* **Standby**: Your Instance is stopped, but its data remains on the local storage. The Instance is still allocated to your account and can be restarted anytime.

<Message type="important">
  The **standby mode** is charged as a running Instance. To avoid being billed for an unused Instance, power it off and ensure no IPs or allocated storage are left in use.
</Message>


### Why do I have to specify the CPU architecture when creating an image from a volume?

ARM and x86-based Instances use a different instruction set, which requires specifying the architecture of the platform when creating an image from a volume.

An ARM CPU uses a Reduced Instruction Set Computing [RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer/) architecture, while an x86 CPU uses a Complex Instruction Set Computing [CISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer/) architecture.


### Can I reach my Instance using a DNS hostname instead of its IP address?

Yes, each Instance has two DNS hostnames associated with it: 

* A **public DNS hostname**: `<instance-uuid>.pub.instances.scw.cloud` 
* A **private DNS hostname**: `<instance-uuid>.priv.instances.scw.cloud`

Both are automatically updated when the Instance moves to another hypervisor, also changing its IPv6 and private IPv4. You can either use these hostnames directly or configure a [CNAME record](/dedibox-network/dns/concepts/#resource-records) linking to it.


### Can I migrate from a first-generation DEV1 Instance to a PLAY2 Instance?

Yes. Refer to the [changing the commercial type of an Instance](/compute/instances/api-cli/migrating-instances/) documentation.


### Can I migrate from my first-generation GP1 Instance to a PRO2 Instance?

Yes. Refer to the [changing the commercial type of an Instance](/compute/instances/api-cli/migrating-instances/) documentation.


### Can I boot my Instance from a Block Storage volume?

Yes. When creating an Instance, you can select Block Storage as a system volume type. This allows you to reboot Instances from the block volume on which your OS is stored.

You can also add a Block volume after creating an Instance and [choosing it as the boot volume](/compute/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes/#how-to-change-the-boot-volume).


## Offers and availability

### Which Linux distributions are available?

We provide a wide range of [Linux distributions](https://www.scaleway.com/en/imagehub/) and InstantApps for Instances.

You are free to bootstrap your own distribution.


### Which Linux distributions are available for Enterprise Instances?

We provide a wide range of different Linux distributions and InstantApps for Instances. Enterprise Instances will work with a selection of most-acclaimed images:

* Ubuntu Focal
* Ubuntu Bionic
* Ubuntu Xenial
* Debian Buster
* Debian Stretch
* CentOS 8
* Fedora 32

### What are the differences between ENT1 and POP2 Instances?

Both ENT1 and POP2 Instance types share the following features:
- Identical hardware specifications
- Dedicated vCPU allocation
- Same pricing structure
- Accelerated booting process

POP2 Instances provide CPU- and memory-optimized variants tailored to suit your workload requirements more effectively. The primary distinction between ENT1 and POP2 lies in [AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV)](https://www.amd.com/fr/developer/sev.html/), which is disabled for POP2 Instances.
By choosing POP2 Instances, you gain access to the latest features, such as the potential for live migration of Instances in the future, ensuring that your infrastructure remains aligned with evolving demands and technological advancements.
We recommend choosing POP2 Instances for most general workloads unless your specific workload requires features unique to ENT1 Instances.

### Where are my Instances located?

Scaleway offers different Instance ranges in all regions: Paris (France), Amsterdam (Netherlands), and Warsaw (Poland).

Check the [Instances availability guide](/console/account/reference-content/products-availability/) to discover where each Instance type is available.


### What makes FR-PAR-2 a sustainable Region?

`FR-PAR-2` is our sustainable and environmentally efficient Availability Zone (AZ) in Paris.

This Region is entirely powered by renewable (hydraulic) energy. It also has an energetic footprint 30-40% lower than traditional data centers, thanks to the fact that it does not require air conditioning. Learn more about [our environmental commitment](https://www.scaleway.com/en/environmental-leadership/).

## Network

### Which Instances support IP Mobility?

All ranges are compatible except for Instances using the “bootscript” feature, which has [reached its end of life (EOL)](/compute/instances/troubleshooting/bootscript-eol/).

### Can I enable “Routed IP” on my bootscript Instance?

Instances using a bootscript are not compatible with Routed IPs. As the bootscript feature has reached its end of life (EOL), refer to [this tutorial](/compute/instances/troubleshooting/bootscript-eol/) for migration instructions.

### Can I revert the migration to “Routed IP”?

No, the migration is permanent.

### Will my Instance retain its public IPv4 after migration?

Yes, your existing flexible public IPv4 will be converted to a routed one and will remain unchanged after migration.

### Will my Instance retain its public IPv6 after migration?

No, you will receive a new IPv6 after migration.

### Will my Instance retain its private IPv4 after migration?

No, the Scaleway private IP will be removed after the migration.

### Will my Instance retain its VPC private IPv4 after migration?

Yes, your VPC configuration will remain intact after migrating to a routed public IPv4.

### Can a resource with a routed IP communicate with a resource with a NAT IP?

Yes, they can communicate with each other using their public IPs.

### Are there any limitations on IP autoconfiguration with the routed IP feature?

Currently, additional routed IPv6 addresses do not autoconfigure on CentOS 7, 8, 9, Alma 8, 9, Rocky 8, 9 after migration.
Additionally, both additional routed IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are not autoconfigured post-migration on Ubuntu 20.04 focal. However, the primary IPv6 continues to be configured via SLAAC. These limitations are currently being addressed.
