## What is Edge Services?

Edge Services is a feature for Scaleway Load Balancers and Object Storage buckets, currently available in [Public Beta](https://www.scaleway.com/en/betas/). It provides a [caching service](/network/edge-services/how-to/configure-cache/) to improve performance by reducing load on your [origin](/network/edge-services/concepts/#origin), and a customizable and secure endpoint for accessing content via Edge Services, which can be set to a subdomain of your choice.

## Which products are compatible with Edge Services?

Edge Services is currently available for Scaleway [Object Storage buckets](/storage/object/) and Scaleway [Load Balancers](/network/load-balancer/).

## How much does Edge Services cost?

Since Edge Services is currently in Public Beta, it is free to use and not billed. Users will be warned before it goes into General Availability and becomes billable. Pricing will be based on subscription plans.

## If I customize my Edge Services endpoint with my own domain, can it serve content over HTTPS?

Yes, if you choose to [customize your Edge Services endpoint with your own subdomain](/network/edge-services/how-to/configure-custom-domain/), you are prompted to generate or upload an SSL/TLS certificate for that subdomain so that Edge Services can serve content over HTTPS. This certificate can either be a Let's Encrypt certificate generated and managed by Scaleway, or you can import your own certificate. If you import your own certificate, it will be stored in Scaleway Secret Manager, and [billed accordingly](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/security-and-account/).
