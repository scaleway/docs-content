You can manage Block Storage resources using either the [Block Storage API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/block/), or the [Instances API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/).

This page shows you how to identify the API that manages your volumes and snapshots using the Scaleway console. Refer to our [dedicated documentation](/block-storage/api-cli/identifying-volume-snapshot-api/) to learn how to identify the API managing your volumes and snapshots using the API and CLI.
