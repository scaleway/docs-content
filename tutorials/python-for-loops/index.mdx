## Introduction

So you know how to **create variables** in Python (`my_variable = 3`), as well as how to **create lists** (`my_list = [3, 5, 9, 6]`) and **dictionaries** (`my_dict = {"Sara": 3 "Aneesa": 5, "Emmanuel": 9, "Tom": 6}`) to store multiple items in a single variable? Then you're ready to learn about **loops**.

A **loop** is a piece of code that tells Python to repeat a specified set of actions multiple times. Loops are a fundamental part of most programming languages, and let you achieve a whole lot with just a few lines of code. Often, they **iterate** over collections of data (such as data held in dictionaries or lists) and carry out all sorts of operations on those collections.

Why are loops useful? Let's look at a quick example:

Imagine you have a list of numbers, and you want to find every number higher than 10. Without a loop, the code is very long and repetitive:

```python
my_list = [3, 10.1, 62, 9]
  
if my_list[0] > 10:
  print(my_list[0])
  
if my_list[1] > 10:
  print(my_list[1])
  
if my_list[2] > 10:
  print(my_list[2])
  
if my_list[3] > 10:
  print(my_list[3])
  
## Output:
10.1
62
```

With a for loop, we can do it in just three lines of code:

```python
for number in my_list:
  if number > 10:
    print(number)
  
## Output:
10.1
62
```

Let's dive into the world of for loops in python, and learn how to code them and what we can do with them.

<Message type="note">
There are two types of loop in Python: 
- **while**-loops repeat while a certain condition is true and exit once the condition is false.
- **for**-loops iterate over a sequence or collection of data and exit when they reach the end of the sequence/collection. 
This tutorial concerns only **for** loops.

## For loop syntax and basic examples

The syntax for a for loop is as follows:

```
for element in iterable-object:
  statement(s)
```

Here are some basic examples of loops iterating over different types of objects:

        my_list = ["red", "blue", "yellow"]

          print(product, product_dict.get(product))

- **for**: this keyword is required to start a loop
- **element**: after the `for` keyword, we can use any variable name we want! This variable will simply access each item of the sequence on each iteration. In the examples above you can see that we've called it variously `element`, `color`, `letter`, `product`, and `x`. Anything works, but generally you should try to give this variable a meaningful name: it will make your code easier to read for yourself and anyone else who looks at it.
- **in**: this keyword is required to introduce the object you want to iterate over in the loop
- **iterable-object**: after the `in` keyword, state the object you want to iterate over. This can be any iterable object, including lists, strings, dictionaries, ranges, tuples and sets. 
- The for statement must end with a **colon**, followed by a **line return** and **indentation**.
- **statement(s)**: One or more actions to be carried out on every iteration of the loop. In the examples above we simply use a print statement, but anything is possible.

## More examples

Here are some more examples to show how loops can be used:

### Loops with an if/else statement

We can use an if/else statement inside the loop to deal with different possibilities:

```python
print("The loop is starting")
  
for number in [1, 10, 9, 4]:
  if number > 5:
    print(number, "is greater than 5")
  else:
    print(number, "is not greater than 5")
  
print("The loop has finished")
  
## Output:
The loop is starting
1 is not greater than 5
10 is greater than 5
9 is greater than 5
4 is not greater than 5
The loop has finished
```

## Loops with a range() function

As we saw in an earlier example we can use loops with Python's built-in `range()` function to state exactly how many times we want the loop to iterate.

This function can be used in a number of ways:

With just one parameter, the range starts at a default of 0 and finishes at (not including) the specified number:

```python
for x in range(3):
  print(x)
  
## Output:
0
1
2
```

With two parameters, we set the start and finish numbers of the range:

```python
for x in range(2, 6):
  print(x)
  
## Output:
2
3
4
5
```

With three parameters, we set the start and finish numbers of the range, and the **step** value (the interval between each iteration):

```python
for x in range(2, 10, 2):
  print(x)
  
## Output:
2
4
6
8
```

### Nested loops

We can use a loop inside another loop: this is called a **nested loop**. This is useful if, for example, you want to loop through a list of lists:

```python

groups = [["Kendall", "Shiv", "Roman"], ["Logan", "Ewan", "Gerri"], ["Tom", "Greg"]]
  
# this first loop iterates through each group:
for group in groups:
    # this second loop iterates through the people in each group:
        for person in group:
            ## we can access both the 'group' and 'person' variables here!
            print(person, "is in the group", group)
  
## Output:
Kendall is in the group ['Kendall', 'Shiv', 'Roman']
Shiv is in the group ['Kendall', 'Shiv', 'Roman']
Roman is in the group ['Kendall', 'Shiv', 'Roman']
Logan is in the group ['Logan', 'Ewan', 'Gerri']
Ewan is in the group ['Logan', 'Ewan', 'Gerri']
Gerri is in the group ['Logan', 'Ewan', 'Gerri']
Tom is in the group ['Tom', 'Greg']
Greg is in the group ['Tom', 'Greg']
```

### Nested loops

We can use a loop inside another loop: this is called a **nested loop**. This is useful if, for example, you want to loop through a list of lists:

```python

groups = [["Kendall", "Shiv", "Roman"], ["Logan", "Ewan", "Gerri"], ["Tom", "Greg"]]
  
# this first loop iterates through each group:
for group in groups:
    # this second loop iterates through the people in each group:
        for person in group:
            ## we can access both the 'group' and 'person' variables here!
            print(person, "is in the group", group)
  
## Output:
Kendall is in the group ['Kendall', 'Shiv', 'Roman']
Shiv is in the group ['Kendall', 'Shiv', 'Roman']
Roman is in the group ['Kendall', 'Shiv', 'Roman']
Logan is in the group ['Logan', 'Ewan', 'Gerri']
Ewan is in the group ['Logan', 'Ewan', 'Gerri']
Gerri is in the group ['Logan', 'Ewan', 'Gerri']
Tom is in the group ['Tom', 'Greg']
Greg is in the group ['Tom', 'Greg']
```
