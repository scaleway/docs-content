Once your InterLink has been [provisioned](/network/interlink/how-to/complete-provisioning/) by your chosen partner, a number of configuration steps become available to you. These steps must be carried out in order for traffic to successfully flow over your InterLink:

- Attach a VPC
- Create and attach an Allowed Routes list
- Activate route propagation

<Lightbox src="scaleway-interlink-config.webp" alt="A four step flow chart shows the following steps: 1. Create InterLink, 2. Attach VPC, 3. Attach allowed routes list, 4. Activate route propagation. After these steps are complete, traffic can flow across the InterLink" />

This document explains how to complete these configuration steps with the Scaleway console.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Ordered an InterLink](/network/interlink/how-to/order-interlink/) which has been [provisioned](/network/interlink/how-to/complete-provisioning/) by the partner
