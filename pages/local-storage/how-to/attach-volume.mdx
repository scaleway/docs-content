import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'


You can attach a Local Storage volume to your Instance at any time, as long as they are both in the same [Availability Zone](/instances/concepts/#availability-zone).

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created a [Local Storage volume](/local-storage/how-to/create-volume/)
- At least one [Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) with Local Storage capabilities


1. Click **Local Storage** in the **Storage** section of the Scaleway console side menu. Your Local Storage volumes display.
2. Click **Attach to Instance** next to the volume of your choice. A pop-up displays.
3. Select the Instance to which you want to attach your volume from the drop-down.
4. Click **Attach volume to Instance**.

<Message type="important">
  * You can attach up to 15 volumes at a time to a single Instance.
  * Local Storage resources are limited and bound to the characteristics of your Instance (vCPU/RAM). Alternatively, you can use [Block Storage](/block-storage/quickstart/) to increase the storage capacity of your Instance.
