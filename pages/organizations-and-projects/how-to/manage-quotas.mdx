## How to view Organization quotas

1. Click the **Quotas** tab of the [Organization Dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/organization). A list of all quotas displays.
2. Click the name of the resource you want to view the quotas for.
3. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** next to the name of your resource of choice. A pop-up appears.

  In the pop-up you can find more information about the quota, such as **Name**, **Technical name**, **Product**, **Max quota per Availability Zone**, **Current usage**, and **Description**.

You can also use the menu at the top of the page to search and filter your quotas.

As shown in the image above, you can:

1. Search by the precise name of the resource.
2. Specify the product you want to see the quotas for.
3. Specify the location of your resources. This includes regions, Availability Zones, or all locations.
4. Check the box to see used quotas only.
5. Reset your filters.
6. Click **Filter** to apply your choices.

## How to increase quotas

Quotas are assigned by default according to each account level.

There are two ways you can increase your account level:
    - By [validating your payment method](/billing/how-to/add-payment-method/#how-to-add-a-credit-card)
    - By [verifying your identity](/account/how-to/verify-identity/)

For a detailed list of available quotas and the account levels necessary to increase quota capacity, as well as availability per location, refer to the [Understanding Organization Quotas](/organizations-and-projects/additional-content/organization-quotas/) documentation page.

<Message type="note">
  If you have already validated your payment method and identity and want to increase your quota beyond the values shown in the console or on the [Understanding Organization Quotas](/organizations-and-projects/additional-content/organization-quotas/) documentation page, you must [contact our support team](https://console.scaleway.com/support/create).
