You can use different methods to log in to the Scaleway console.

Whether you are an Organization Owner or an IAM Member, Scaleway supports multiple authentication methods, including email and password, one-time authentication codes, and Single Sign-On (SSO) via Google, GitHub, or SAML. While many methods are similar across roles, availability depends on what user type you are and how your organization is configured.

An IAM user is a human user in an Organization. They can be of two types:
    - **Owner**: You are the Owner of the Organization that was created with your account. You manage the root account and log in directly.
    - **Member**: You are a Member when you are added to an Organization by an Owner or user with IAM Manager permissions. Members exist only within the specific Organizations in which they are created. They must identify their Organization ID before logging in.

This page describes the different log in methods available, and what to consider based on your role.

<Requirements />

- A [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/en/) account
- Know your IAM user type: Owner or Member

## How to log in as an Organization Owner

1. Open your web browser and go to the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).
    <Tabs id="create-account">
      <TabsTab label="Log in with SSO">
      1. Click the **Google** or the **GitHub** logo, depending on the account you want to use.
      2. Log in through the respective Google or GitHub login pages.
      3. If multifactor authentication (MFA) is activated, enter the authentication code.
      </TabsTab>
      <TabsTab label="Authentication code">
      Instead of your password, you can sign in to the Scaleway console with a one-time authentication code. The code is sent directly to your email inbox and can only be used once. This provides quick and secure access to your account without the hassle of remembering your password.

      1. Enter your email address in the form and click **Send authentication code**.
        A code will be sent to your email inbox.
      2. Check your email inbox for an email with the subject **Use the authentication code to access your account** and open it.
      3. Copy the code and enter it in the Scaleway console.
          <Lightbox image={image} alt="" />

      You will be redirected to and logged into your management console.

      <Message type="note">
        The authentication code expires 10 minutes after it is sent to you. It becomes invalid as soon as you use it. If you log out from the console and want to log in again without your password, you will need to request a new code by repeating the steps above.

    </TabsTab>
     <TabsTab label="Password">
      1. Click **Log in with password**.

## Log in as an IAM Member

If you were added to a Scaleway Organization as an [IAM Member](/iam/concepts#members), you must follow a dedicated login process.

1. Open your web browser and go to the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).
2. Click [Log in as an IAM Member](https://account.scaleway.com/member-login).
3. Enter the Organization ID or alias and click **Continue**.
    <Message type="important">

    </Message>
4. Enter the username given to you by your Organization's Owner or administrator.
5. Select an authentication method between **Log in with SSO**, **Send code** and **Enter password**.
    <Tabs id="create-account">

      Scaleway provides Single Sign-On (SSO) options for a seamless login experience. By default, you can use your Google or Github account to log in to the console. To do so, make sure the email address associated with your Scaleway account matches the email address of your Google or Github account.

      <Message type="important">
        - If your Organization has [set up login via SAML](/iam/how-to/set-up-identity-federation), you must use the Identity Provider configured for your company to log in with SSO.
        - SAML SSO login is in Early Access. This means that currenttly, only a few Organizations can access and test the feature.
      </Message>

      1. Click **Sign in with SSO**, if you are logging in with SAML SSO, and click the **Google** or the **GitHub** logo for OAuth2 SSO login.

## How to log in using MFA

If [Multifactor Authentication (MFA)](/account/how-to/use-2fa) is enabled on your account, MFA authentication will be an additional step for all methods of log in described on this page.

You can authenticate using either a:
    - **One-time password (TOTP)** - method through which you access your account using a unique, time-based validation code generated by an app, or
    - **Passkey** - secure authentication method that eliminates the need to create, manage, or remember passwords.

If the login information provided in any of the previous methods is valid, you will be redirected the Multifactor Authentication screen. If both MFA methods are enabled in your account, you will see the **passkey** screen by default.

<Tabs id="mfa-login">
  <TabsTab label="Log in with a passkey">
  1. Click **Use passkey**. Your password manager pops-up.
  2. Follow the steps in your password manager.

  If the passkey is valid, you are redirected to the Organization dashboard.
  </TabsTab>
  <TabsTab label="Log in with TOTP">
  1. Click **Switch to authenticator app**.
  2. Enter a valid TOTP token or backup key.
      <Message type="note">
        This is the token provided in your TOTP app.
      </Message>
  2. Click **Log in**.

  If the code is correct, you are redirected to the Organization dashboard.
