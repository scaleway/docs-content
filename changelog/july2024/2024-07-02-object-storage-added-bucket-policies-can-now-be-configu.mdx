Bucket policies can now be created, viewed and edited from the Console next to your buckets list. Additionally, you can now see which buckets lack policies and get a centralized view of all your bucket policies. 

Simple and intuitive access management is key for reducing the risk of configuration errors and enhancing security. With a user-friendly interface that allows to both configure IAM and Bucket policies, granting granular access to your Object Storage ressources is easier and more reliable than ever.
