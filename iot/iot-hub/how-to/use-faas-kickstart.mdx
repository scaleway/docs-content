The Serverless Functions kickstart provides a [FaaS engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_as_a_service) to trigger functions upon receiving messages on your IoT Hub.

It will set up and configure [Nuclio](https://nuclio.io/) on a Scaleway Instance.

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have [created an IoT Hub](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/create-hub)
- You have [installed `mosquitto`](https://mosquitto.org/download/) on your local computer

## How to create the Serverless Functions Kickstart 

1. Create a new [logging purpose Kickstart](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/create-kickstart) from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/iot-hub/kickstarts/create). 
<Lightbox src="assets/scaleway-faas-purpose-kickstart.webp" alt="" />

2. Select the IoT Hub and device to use with the Kickstart.
  <Message type="important">

  Currently only devices supporting insecure connections are allowed for this IoT Kickstart.

  </Message>

3. Choose the geographical region to deploy your Kickstart. 

4. Set a password for the Kickstart's dashboard. 

5. Click **Create a Kickstart** to launch the installation of the software stack. 

<Message type="note">

The Kickstart setup process will insert a first log item in the database to make sure it is up and running.

## How to use the Serverless Functions Kickstart 

A first example function will be pre-configured for you during the Kickstart installation. 
It sends a message to a topic named `events` when triggered and is configured to be triggered when a message is published to any topic under `please/react/to/` on your IoT Hub.

 In the following example, you add 2 more devices to the IoT Hub you connected the Kickstart to. Device A subscribes to the `events` topic and device B publishes a message to the `please/react/to/hello/world` topic.

1. Click **IoT Hub** in the **IoT Station** section of the side menu. The list of your IoT Hubs displays.

2. Click the name of the IoT Hub you want to configure. The hub's overview page displays.

3. Click **Devices** to display the configuration of the device.

4. Click **Add devices** in the devices tab. The **Create a Device** wizard displays.

5. Enter a name for the first device, and allow insecure connections.

6. Click **Add a Device to your Hub**. The details of the device display. Take a note of the **Device ID**:
<Lightbox src="assets/scaleway-device-id.webp" alt="" />

7. Repeat the steps above to add a second device. 

8. Retrieve your Hub's endpoint on from the **Networks** tab. For this tutorial you use the **Default MQTT Network**:
<Lightbox src="assets/scaleway-iothub-endpoint.webp" alt="" />

## How to communicate with your Hub

1. Open a terminal window and define the following variables:
  ```
  ID_A="<Device_A_ID>"
  ID_B="<Device_B_ID>"
  ENDPOINT="<Default_MQTT_Network_Endpoint>"
  ```
2. Run the following command using device A to subscribe to `events` topic: `mosquitto_sub -h ENDPOINT -i ID_A -t events`.

3. Run the following command  device B to publish a message to `please/react/to/hello/world` topic: `mosquitto_pub -h ENDPOINT -i ID_B -t please/react/to/hello/world -m "Hi there."`.

You should have received a message on device A with the following payload: `Received a message on please/react/to/hello/world (length: 9)`. This message was generated by the example function running in Nuclio.

### How to process and send messages 

The function which will handle your messages will receive two arguments:
- `events.url`: the topic the message was published to
- `events.body`: the message payload

When the function is done processing the message, it may return a message to be published using the following parameters:
- response status code: 200
- response body: the message payload (any data)
- response header `X-MQTT-Topic`: the topic to publish message to (any valid topic string)
- response header `X-MQTT-Retain`: whether to set the retain flag on the message (boolean value) (optional, default: false)


### How to trigger the function

Nuclio connects a MQTT client to the IoT Hub and subscribes to a topic. When a message is received, it runs the function against it and, if requested by the function, publishes back a message on the IoT Hub.

Because of the way triggers are implemented in Nuclio, it spawns one MQTT client per function. This means you need to add an IoT Device to your IoT Hub for each function.

To create the trigger for your function follow these steps:

1. Open a web browser on your local computer and point it to `http://<your_faas_instance_ip>`. Authenticate using the **admin** user and the password set during the configuration of the Kickstart. The Nuclio dashboard displays.
2. Go to the trigger tab in your function editor in Nuclio dashboard.
    <Lightbox src="assets/scaleway-nuclio-dashboard.webp" alt="" />

    - Select **MQTT** as trigger class
    - Enter `iot.fr-par.scw.cloud:1883` as URL (this may vary, refer to the IoT Hub overview page in your Scaleway console)
    - Enter your device ID as Username, no password required
    - Create a new subscription
    - Choose the topic ([MQTT topics documentation](http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/understanding-mqtt-topics/)) and QoS level ([MQTT QoS documentation](http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/understanding-mqtt-qos-levels-part-1/))
    - Put anything you want in trigger name and worker allocator name
    
3. Click **Deploy** to deploy your function
