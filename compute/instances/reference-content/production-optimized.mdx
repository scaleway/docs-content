An Instance is a virtual machine in the cloud. Scaleway supports several [types of Instances](/compute/instances/reference-content/choosing-instance-type), each with their own set of resources, unique value propositions, and technical specifications. Each Instance supports the essential operating systems and distributions, as well as customized [Instantapps](/compute/instances/concepts/#instantapp).

## Production-Optimized range: Enterprise Instances

Scaleway's **Production-Optimized** range includes Enterprise Instances. Enterprise Instances are high-end, dedicated cloud Instances for demanding workloads. They offer the highest consistent performance per-core to support real-time applications. In addition, their computing power makes them generally more robust for compute-intensive workloads. 

They are best suited for production websites, enterprise applications, high traffic databases, and any application that requires 100% sustained CPU usage such as monitoring and analytics software. This includes Prometheus and Grafana, gaming sessions and ad serving.

See below the technical specifications of Enterprise Instances:
