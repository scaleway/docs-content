The Scaleway console **Billing Alerts** feature allows you to manage and keep track of your expenses by setting up alerts to trigger when a budget threshold is reached. An alert can be sent to you by SMS, email or API webhook.

The budget is the limit of your expenses, in euros. The threshold is a percentage of this limit. Both are previously defined by you in the console.

**For example:**

  - If you have defined a budget of €1000, you may configure an email notification to be sent once you have consumed 50% of this limit. In this case, once your consumption gets to €500 you will receive an email informing you the limit threshold has been reached.

    <Message type="important">
      Billing alerts only provide a rough estimate of what may be charged to your monthly invoice. Additional costs related to your usage before the alert is triggered may still appear on your invoice after the alert is generated. Only your monthly invoice is considered legally valid.

3. Click **Create a billing alert** to configure an alert action. A pop-up displays.
4. Enter the percentage threshold that triggers the alert and configure the warning that will be sent.
    Avialable warning types are: 
    * SMS notifications
    * E-mail notifications
    * Webhook triggers
6. Click **Create billing alert** to enable the alert.
    You may set up to 10 billing alerts. If you wish to add more, click **Add billing alert** and repeat the steps above.

## Webhook API Call

When you configure a Webhook, an `HTTP` request is made to the configured URL. It will transmit the following information as an `HTTP POST` request to the given URL:

```
Header: "Content-Type": "application/json"
POST /my/configured/webhook
{
    "invoice_start_date": <INVOICE_START_DATE>,
    "threshold": <THRESHOLD_VALUE_IN_PERCENT>
}
```
