If you do not want to use Scaleway services anymore, you can close your account and/or [erase your personal data](/console/account/how-to/manage-my-personal-data-gdpr/#how-to-erase-your-account-and-personal-data). 

## Closing your account or erasing your personal data: what’s the difference

<Macro id="close-vs-erase" />

## How to close your account

Closing your account will permanently delete your Organization’s servers, resources, services, and backups. However, you keep access to the Scaleway console. 

<Macro id="requirements" />
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Ownership](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) of the Organization you intend to delete

<Message type="note">
  We recommend you delete all resources before closing your account. Otherwise, the remaining resources will be billed for usage before their manual deletion (this can take up to 10 days).
</Message>



1. Click the **Settings** tab from your Organization dashboard (alternatively, you can go to the User account page.)
2. Scroll down to the **Close** account section.
3. Click the **Close account** button once you read and agree with the warning message.
4. Type **CLOSE**, then click **Continue closing** to confirm your decision.
5. Select the reasons why you are closing your account.
6. Click **Close account**. A message appears to confirm that closing has been scheduled.

## How to reopen your account

Once your account is closed, you can still access the Scaleway console. A red banner in the top navigation bar will explain that your account has been closed. If you want to reopen it, you can create a support ticket by clicking the link in the banner.
