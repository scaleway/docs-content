  This documentation concerns rescue mode for [Elastic Metal servers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/elastic-metal/). To use rescue mode on [Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/), refer to the corresponding [documentation](/compute/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes/#how-to-use-rescue-mode).
</Message>

Rescue mode allows you to boot an [Elastic Metal server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/elastic-metal/) from the network. It downloads a rescue operating system based on [Ubuntu Linux](https://ubuntu.com/) that runs completely in the server RAM. This allows you to perform maintenance and data recovery operations, even if the machine is unreachable in normal mode.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An Elastic Metal server [installed](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/quickstart/#how-to-create-an-elastic-metal-server)


1. Click **Elastic Metal** in the **Bare Metal** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The Elastic Metal dashboard displays.
2. Choose the server you want to reboot into rescue mode from the list. Click its name to display that server's information page.
3. Scroll down to the **Rescue mode** section.
4. Click **Boot in rescue mode** to reboot the server into rescue mode:

    The server starts to reboot into rescue mode.

    <Message type="note">
      Depending on the hardware model of the machine, the reboot may take several minutes.
    </Message>
5. Once rebooted, use a terminal application to log into the machine using SSH with the user account `root`:
    ```
    ssh root@<elastic-metal-server>
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      Rescue mode uses the SSH keys registered for your Elastic Metal server as an authentication method. If you have lost your private key, you can access your server using the credentials displayed in the console:

    </Message>

You are now logged into rescue mode and able to perform maintenance actions on the machine. The rescue mode is based on Ubuntu [Bionic Beaver (18.04)](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BionicBeaver/ReleaseNotes/), and you can run commands as on any Ubuntu Linux machine.

  Rescue mode runs completely in the RAM of the server. To access files located on the hard disk, it needs to be mounted. The disk can be mounted automatically by running `mountall.sh`
</Message>


## How to reboot into normal mode

Once the maintenance of the machine is completed, it can be rebooted back into the operating system installed on the hard disk of the server.

To reboot the server into normal mode, click **Switch to normal mode** in the rescue mode section of the server's details. The server reboots on the installed system and will be available in normal mode within a few minutes.
