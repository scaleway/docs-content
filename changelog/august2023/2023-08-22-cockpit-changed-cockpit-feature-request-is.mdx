We are happy to announce that we closed one of the most wanted feature : https://feature-request.scaleway.com/posts/38/log-centralization-and-management at Scaleway (open since Jan. 21)
Almost every Scaleway's products are available in Cockpit for metrics and/or logs. New features and capabilities will be added to the product. You can see what's already there or planned : https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/observability/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-limitations/#product-integration-into-cockpit

For all future needs, we encourage you to open a specific feature request of what you need to integrate in Cockpit.
