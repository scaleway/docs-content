This page shows you how to configure Tink for encrypting and decrypting data with Scaleway's Key Manager.

We recommend using Tink with Scalewayâ€™s Key Manager, especially for Go-based applications.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Downloaded and installed [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- Installed the [Scaleway Go SDK](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-sdk-go) with [valid credentials](/scaleway-sdk/go-sdk/)


The Scaleway Tink extension generates a unique data encryption key for each piece of data that it encrypts. This method follows the cryptography best practices of using unique data encryption keys for each encryption operation.

Tink is a library that helps you perform encryption (securing data) and manage encryption keys. It can work with various key management services (KMS), including Scaleway's Key Manager.
To use Tink with Scaleway Key Manager, you need to install dependencies that let Tink interact with Key Manager.

In order to use Tink for data encryption, you need to provide it with a key URI and a configuration file:

- The key URI points to your key encryption key (KEK) in Scaleway Key Manager.

- The configuration file grants Tink the necessary permissions to access and use the KEK identified by the Key URI.

Tink generates a data encryption key (DEK) which will be used to encrypt your data. The DEK itself is then encrypted using the KEK from Key Manager. This ensures that the DEK is securely protected and can only be decrypted by someone with access to the KEK.

The final output is a single ciphertext that includes both the encrypted data and the encrypted DEK (wrapped DEK). This means that the DEK and the data are both securely packaged together.

Scaleway supports the **Go Tink provider**.

## Setting up environment variables

Open a terminal and export the following environment variables. Make sure that you replace the placeholder values with your own.

  ```bash
  export SCW_ACCESS_KEY="<access-key>"
  export SCW_SECRET_KEY="<secret-key>"
  export SCW_DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ID="<organization-id>"
  export SCW_PROJECT_ID="<project-id>"
  export SCW_DEFAULT_REGION="<region>"
  export SCW_API_URL="<api-url>"
  export SCW_KM_KEY_ID="<key-id>"
  ```

## Installing the necessary dependencies

1. Open a terminal and initialize a Go module in your project directory:
    ```shell
    go mod init <your-project-directory>
    ```

2. Run the following commands to install the Tink library and the Scaleway Tink Provider for Go:

    ```shell
    # Install Tink for Go
    go get -u github.com/tink-crypto/tink-go/v2

    # Install the Scaleway Tink extension
    go get -u github.com/scaleway/tink-go-scwkms
    go mod tidy
    ```
3. Optionally, create a key encryption key (KEK) to start using Key Manager.
4. Optionally, create a data encryption key (DEK) that will be used for data encryption and decryption. Find out how to create and manage DEKs in the [dedicated documentation](replace-with-link).
