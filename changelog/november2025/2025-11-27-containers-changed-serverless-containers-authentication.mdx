Serverless Containers is using a product-specific authentication method based on JWT to authenticate requests for private endpoints. It's now possible to use the new IAM policy `ContainersPrivateAccess`.

Previous authentication method based on JWT will be deprecated gradually. Please follow [How to migrate from JWT to IAM authentication for private containers documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/serverless-containers/how-to/migrate-jwt-to-iam-authentication/).
