<Macro id="iam-requirements" />
 
It is possible to implement a [bucket policy](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/) to grant a Scaleway organization or project viewing rights to a bucket in a different project. 
<Lightbox src="scaleway-read-only-schema.webp" alt="" />

For example, you are logged in to Organization A and you have a bucket (A1) inside Project A. You wish to share the bucket in read-only mode with users in Organization B, Project B. 

To do so, you have to apply a policy to bucket A1 that grants access to Organization B or Project B and include which API calls they are allowed to make. 

To guarantee that they can only view contents, include `"s3:ListBucket"` and `"s3:GetObject"` under **Action** in the **bucket-policy.json** file you create.

Specify which resources they can access under **Resource**:

- `"<BUCKET_NAME>"` - Grants access to the bucket, but not to the objects inside. If the `s3:ListBucket` action is applied, this resource specification is required. 
- `"<BUCKET_NAME>/*"` - Grants access to all objects inside a bucket, but not to the bucket itself. If the `s3:GetObject` actions is applied, this resource specification is required. 
- `"<BUCKET_NAME>/<PREFIX>/*"` - Grants access only to objects with the specified prefix inside a bucket, but not to the bucket itself. For example, if you apply a bucket policy that specifies `"my_files/movie/*"` under **Resource**, you would grant access to all objects with the `movie/` prefix, but not to other objects in `my_files/` bucket. If the `s3:GetObject` actions is applied, this resource specification is required.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "Mybucketpolicy",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "DelegateAccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "SCW": "project_id:<PROJECT_ID>"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "<BUCKET_NAME>",
                "<BUCKET_NAME>/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
Apply the policy using the [PutBucketPolicy](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-operations#put-bucket-policy) API call or run the following aws-cli command: 

```
$ aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket <SOURCE_BUCKET> --profile default_project --policy file://bucket-policy.json
``` 
You can provide the user in Organization B with the name of your bucket. If the policy is correctly applied, they will be able to see bucket A1 included in their bucket list when running `List_Buckets`. If they know the name of an object, they can view their details by running [`Get_Object`](/storage/object/api-cli/object-operations#get-object).
