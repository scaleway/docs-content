## What are PLAY2 Instances?
Scaleway's latest generation PLAY2 Instances are designed for testing and development purposes.
PLAY2 Instances are the second generation of Development Instances after DEV1. PLAY2 Instances are small and agile and meet performance requirements for standard testing and development scenarios.
PLAY2 Instances are ideal for bootstrapping your developments and running your tests. Once you're done, you can take advantage of the complete Scaleway ecosystem to push your cloud-native applications into production on PRO2 or ENT1 Instances. 
Scaleway's PLAY2 Instances rely on the AMD EPYCâ„¢ 7003 Series processor.
