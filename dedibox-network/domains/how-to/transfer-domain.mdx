You can transfer any domain bought or renewed at another registrar to Scaleway as long as you meet the conditions shown below.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net/)
- An unlocked domain at an external registrar (not Scaleway) and access to its authorization key
- A domain name that:
  - Has at least 15 days until its expiration
  - Was created at least 60 days ago or renewed at least 45 days ago
- Up-to-date contact information with your current registrar
- A domain that is not a premium domain
- An email address provided in the whois of the domain that is not protected with an antispam

1. In your browser, navigate to [the Scaleway domain name order page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/domain/).
2. Enter your domain name in the search bar, and click **search a domain**. The **Domain name choice** page displays, showing that the domain is not available for buy.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-transfer-domain.webp" alt="" />
3. Scroll to the **Are you the owner of this domain name?** section, and under **Transfer**, click **Transfer yourdomain.ext**. You are directed to the transfer form.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-authcode.webp" alt="" />
4. Enter the Authcode provided by your current registrar (if it is required: this depends on the domain extension).
    <Message type="note">
      By default, Scaleway's DNS servers are not activated after the transfer. However, you can choose to activate these by ticking the box if you wish.

5. Read the information about the conditions of the transfer, and click **Confirm** to state that you comply with them. You are directed to the hosting page.
6. Select a hosting package, or click **No hosting**. You can also add a hosting backup, if you wish.
    <Message type="note">
      If you buy web hosting, you get your domain name for free with your order or renewal.
    </Message>
7. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click **Order**.
8. If you did not select hosting backup, a pop-up may display asking you to confirm your choice. Click **Continue without backup** or **Add backup**. The **Contact information** page displays.
9. Complete the contact information for the domain name.
    <Message type = "important">
      You must always keep the domain owner’s contact details accurate and up-to-date. If you wish to change details about the owner’s identity, such as full name(s) or corporate name, you must complete the [change of owner/applicant](/dedibox-network/domains/how-to/change-ownership/) process via the [console](https://console.online.net/fr/domain/trade/).

10. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click **Confirm**. The **Summary** page displays.
11. Check the summary of your order and select a payment mode from the drop-down menu. You must also agree to the terms of service as well as the web hosting specific terms, and choose whether to activate automatic renewal of your domain.
12. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click **Confirm my command**. You are redirected to the payment gateway to complete your payment.
    <Message type="note">
      You will generally receive one or more emails to confirm the transfer. However, since the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force, it is possible that the process will be completed without the use of email. This depends on your registrar and registry. If you receive no email, the transfer will be validated after 14 days.
