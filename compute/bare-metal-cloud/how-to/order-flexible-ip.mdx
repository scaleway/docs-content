[Flexible IP addresses](/compute/bare-metal-cloud/concepts/#flexible-ip) are additional IP addresses, available for [Bare Metal servers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/bare-metal-servers/). They allow you to move an IP from one server to another without changing your whole configuration. Flexible IPs can also be used as additional IP addresses to create virtual machines on your Bare Metal server.

<Message type="important">

  Note that Scaleway offers flexible IPs for [Bare Metal servers](/compute/bare-metal-cloud/concepts/#bare-metal-server), [Instances](/compute/instances/concepts/#instance) and [Public Gateways](/network/vpc/concepts/#public-gateway). Each of these sets of flexible IPs is independent, and usable only with that product. Instance flexible IPs cannot be attached to Bare Metal servers or Public Gateways, and vice versa.
