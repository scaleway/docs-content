When you [order an Elastic Metal server](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/create-server/), you can see the estimated impact of your Elastic Metal server of choice before you order. In this page we explain how the estimation is measured.

<Message type="note">
  The estimation described on this page is based on the calculation methodology detailed in the [Environmental Footprint calculation breakdown](/environmental-footprint/environmental-footprint/additional-content/environmental-footprint-calculator) documentation page.

## Availability Zone footprint estimation

When you select your Elastic Metal server's Availability Zone, you can see the quantity of CO2e emitted per kW consumed per zone.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-env-impact-estimation-az.webp" alt="screenshot of the Scaleway console showing the different availability zones in which you can create an Elastic Metal server. For each AZ, three green leaves indicate the level of environmental impact - the system is explained below." />

This data is determined by the [PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness)](/environmental-footprint/environmental-footprint/concepts/#pue-power-usage-effectiveness) of the datacenter and the [energy mix](/environmental-footprint/environmental-footprint/concepts/#energy-mix) of the country in which the datacenter is located.

<Message type="note">
  We use [Ember's](https://ember-climate.org/) Electricity Data Explorer to determine the impact linked to the energy mix. You can also refer to [Electricity Maps' Environmental Impact by Zone map](https://app.electricitymaps.com/map) for a visual representation of the energy mix of each region, including France, Poland, and the Netherlands.

The estimation is represented by three green leaf icons:

  - When the three leafs are dark green, this means that the AZ has the lowest quantity of CO2e emitted per kW consumed
  - When two leafs are dark green, this means this that the AZ has a low quantity of CO2e emitted per kW consumed
  - When only one leaf is dark green, the AZ has bigger quantity of CO2e emitted per kW consumed

  When you hover your cursor over the leaves or when you select the AZ, you can see the detail of the environmental footprint estimation in kgCO₂e.

## Elastic Metal offers footprint estimation

For Elastic Metal offers, the environmental footprint estimation considers the impact of the **manufacturing** and **use** of all the elements that allow the service to work, such as network, cross-IT equipment and stock, and non-IT elements, for example.

The estimation is based on tests carried out by the Hardware team at Scaleway. Each range of offers was tested using different compute configurations to ensure coverage of a variety of possible power consumption setups.

These different compute configurations allow us to simulate enough use cases to have an idea of the power consumption, but the actual consumption will depend on how the server is used in practice.

We estimate the measure the server's electricity consumption and then calculate its estimated impact based on the energy mix of the selected zone and the datacenter's PUE.

The estimation is represented by three green leaf icons:

For each offer, three green leaves indicate the level of environmental impact - the system is explained below." />

  - When the three leafs are dark green, this means that the offer has the lowest environmental impact
  - When two leafs are dark green, this means this that the offer has a low environmental impact
  - When only one leaf is dark green, the offer has bigger environmental impact

  When you hover your cursor over the leaves or when you select an offer, you can see the detail of the environmental footprint estimation in kgCO₂e per hour or per month, depending on the billing method chosen.

A summary of your total environmental footprint estimation is shown before the order summary.

The summary shows the estimation for the offer selected. The impact of the AZ footprint on the offer is integrated into the calculation of usage, described in the [Environmental Footprint calculation breakdown](/environmental-footprint/environmental-footprint/additional-content/environmental-footprint-calculator) documentation page.
