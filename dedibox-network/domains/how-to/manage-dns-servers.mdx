A DNS server is a program that responds to requests for DNS zones configured by the administrator. DNS servers typically operate in pairs, each pair consisting of a primary and secondary server.

Scaleway Dedibox's DNS servers are as follows:

  * Primary server:     ns0.online.net   (`195.154.228.249`)
  * Secondary server:   ns1.online.net   (`62.210.16.9`)

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net) 
  - You own a domain name

## How to find the nameservers and the registrar of your domain

1. Go to [http://who.is](http://who.is).
2. Enter your domain name in the format **yourdomain.ext** (no www).
3. In the results, look at the **Registrar Info** and **Name Servers**.

## How to configure Dedibox DNS servers for your domain

### ...if you ordered your domain name with Scaleway

If you ordered your domain name with Scaleway, your domain automatically configures to our DNS servers. No further action is required by you.

### ...if your domain name is registered elsewhere

You can still use your Dedibox web hosting, and simply ask your registrar to make some changes to your domain's DNS zones. 

#### For a WEB offer

For the website (depending on your choice):

## How to change your DNS servers

<Message type="important">
  Changing your DNS servers or zones is a function only for experts.

  We do not provide any support for web hosting and domain names bought at Scaleway if the DNS servers are modified by the user.

1. From the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net), click **Domain**. A list of your domains displays.
2. Click **Configure domain name** next to the relevant domain. 
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-domain-configure.webp" alt="" />
3. Click the **Manage DNS servers** tab.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-change-dns.webp" alt="" />
4. Modify the DNS servers to your requirements.
    <Message type="important">
      The DNS zone must be configured on the new server before the change in the console.
      If you have an error such as “SOA not found”, we invite you to check this with your provider.
