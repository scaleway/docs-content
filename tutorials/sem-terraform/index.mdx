In this tutorial, you will use a Terraform configuration file that builds your entire infrastructure such as a [Database Instance](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/concepts/#database-instance), a [secret](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#secret) and a [version](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#version) in which your database credentials are stored. You will then be able to access your database credentials securely from the Scaleway console.

<Message type="requirement">
 - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
 - You have created an [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
 - You have [configured your environment variables](/developer-tools/scaleway-cli/reference-content/environment-variables/#recommended-scaleway-configuration-file)
</Message>

## Clone the GitHub repository

We have created a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/scaleway/tutorial-sem-terraform) that contains all the code you need to deploy your infrastructure.

Open a terminal and clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

        ```bash
        git clone git@github.com:scaleway/tutorial-sem-terraform.git
        ```

### Files and directories

In the `tutorial-sem-terraform` directory, you will find a folder named `examples` which contains the `key-value` folder. The `key-value` folder contains two additional folders named `app` and `infra`. The `infra` folder contains the files that will configure your database and secret, whereas the `app` folder will interact with the database and ask [Secret Manager](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#secret-manager) for the password to connect to the database.

## Build and deploy your infrastructure

1. Open a terminal and go to the `tutorial-sem-terraform` directory using the following command:
    ```bash
    cd tutorial-sem-terraform/examples/key-value/infra
    ```
2. Run the following command to download the dependencies and initialize Terraform:
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```
3. Run the following command to configure your infrastructure:
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```
4. Type `yes` and `Enter` when prompted to enter a value. An output similar to the following displays:
    ```bash
    Apply complete! Resources: 3 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

    Outputs:

    database_public_endpoint = tolist([
      {
        "endpoint_id" = "2e7f8138-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-f932a33e8910"
        "hostname" = ""
        "ip" = "<public-endpoint>"
        "name" = ""
        "port" = <port>
      },
    ])
    ```
5. Navigate to the `app` folder:
    ```bash
    cd .. && cd app
    ```
6. Run the following command:
    ```bash
    go run .
    ```
    An output similar to the following should display:
    ```bash
    Successfully connected!
    ```

## Retrieve your database credentials

1. Click **Secret Manager** in the Security and Identity section of the Scaleway console side menu. Your secrets display.
2. Click the `database_secret` secret.
3. Click the **Versions** tab.
4. Click <Icon name="seeMore" /> next to the secret version. Your database's credentials display.
