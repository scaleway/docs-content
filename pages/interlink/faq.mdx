## What is InterLink and how does it work?

InterLink is Scaleway's product to let you create a secure, private connection between your external infrastructure, and your Scaleway VPC. This allows you to direct your traffic safely from your Scaleway infrastructure to your on-premises infrastructure, away from the public internet.

Currently, InterLink is available in **hosted** version only. This means that you must choose a compatible **partner** to facilitate your InterLink. The partner provides the physical connection, and this connection may be shared between several clients, each allocated a specific amount of bandwidth for their InterLink.

At its simplest level, InterLink can be understood as a configurable connection between your own infrastructure, and your Scaleway VPC. You can configure details such as bandwidth, the VPC to connect to, and routing policies.

## How can I find a partner to provision my InterLink?

To establish a hosted InterLink via a partner, generally you must be a client of that partner, e.g. with your infrastructure in their data center, or on your own premises using the partner as a network provider. For more details, see our [information on choosing a partner](/interlink/reference-content/overview/#hosted-interlinks).

You can see available partners in the Scaleway console by opening the [InterLink order form](https://console.scaleway.com/interlink/links/order). More partners will be added to Scaleway InterLink as time goes on.

## I want to create a dedicated InterLink without a partner, how can I do this?

We plan to make **self-hosted** InterLinks available soon, whereby a single client can provision their own physical connection without a partner, getting sole use of a single InterLink port on Scaleway's router. The bandwidth of this connection can then be used by the client to create several InterLinks just for them.

You can [contact a sales representative](https://www.scaleway.com/en/contact-sales/) to register your interest in a self-hosted InterLink.

## What are the benefits of using InterLink compared to other connectivity solutions?

InterLink allows you to connect your Scaleway VPC to your external infrastructure and bypass the public internet entirely. Compared to a typical internet-based VPN, an InterLink is more reliable, more secure and offers lower latency.
    
## How much does InterLink cost?
