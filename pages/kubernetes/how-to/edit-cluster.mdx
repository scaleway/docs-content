You can manage and edit the parameters of your cluster from the [Scaleway console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements) or by using the [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/). Here, we show you how to edit from the console.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created a [Kubernetes Kapsule cluster](/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/)

## How to manage a Kubernetes Kapsule cluster

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements) side menu. The Kubernetes dashboard displays.
2. From the drop-down menu, select the geographical region you want to manage.
