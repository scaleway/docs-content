## Problem
You are unable to delete your Mac mini.

### Symptoms
- An error message appears when trying to delete your Mac mini.
- The Scaleway console prevents you from deleting your Mac mini.

### Possible causes
- The minimum rental period for Apple Mac mini machines is 24 hours due to [Apple's Software License Agreement](https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/macOSSequoia.pdf) (Section 3. ii).
- Scaleway enforces this restriction to comply with Apple's licensing terms.

### Solution
- After keeping the Mac mini for more than 24 hours, try deleting it again via the Scaleway console, CLI, or API.

## Further troubleshooting
If the issue persists, contact [Scaleway's support](https://console.scaleway.com/support) for assistance with further troubleshooting.
