## How to use it

### Sending Inference requests

To perform inference tasks with your WizardLM model deployed at Scaleway, use the following command:

```bash
curl -s \
-H "X-Auth-Token: <IAM API key>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--request POST \
--url "https://<Deployment UUID>.ifr.fr-par.scw.cloud/" \
--data '{"text_input": "Scaleway Inference service. Say hello", "max_tokens": 200, "temperature": 0.2, "random_seed": 1, "top_p": 0.9}' | jq -r .text_output
```

Make sure to replace <IAM API key> and <Deployment UUID> with your actual [IAM API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) and the Deployment UUID you are targeting.

<Message type="note">
  Ensure that the input data is properly formatted according to the model's input requirements.
</Message>

WizardLM adopts the prompt format from [Vicuna](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/blob/main/docs/vicuna_weights_version.md#example-prompt-weights-v11-v13-v15) and supports multi-turn conversation. The prompt should be as following:

```
A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. 
USER: Hi 
ASSISTANT: Hello.</s>
USER: Who are you? 
ASSISTANT: I am WizardLM.</s>
```

### Receiving Inference responses

Upon sending the HTTP request to the public or private endpoints exposed by the server, you will receive inference responses from the managed Inference server. 
Process the output data according to your application's needs. The response will contain the output generated by the LLM model based on the input provided in the request.
