The Object Storage metrics feature allows you to monitor your Object Storage consumption with a graphical interface from your Scaleway console.

Object Storage metrics provide information about:
  - The number of objects in a bucket
  - The storage used
  - The outgoing bandwidth usage of a bucket

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created an Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)
</Message>

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.
2. Click the bucket name you want to see the metrics of.
3. Click the **Metrics** tab.

    Below are examples of Metrics you can view on your console.

      Please note that these graphs are based on a single daily value, and do not represent the hourly fluctuation of your data. They rather give you an insight into the overall progression of your data consumption. Therefore, they are not suitable for estimating your final invoice.
