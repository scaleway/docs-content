Server filtering by region: A new selector in the top-left corner lets you choose an Availability Zone (AZ) to display only the servers from that region.

**All** tab in server creation: When ordering a server, the “All” tab displays a complete list of all available servers, regardless of their range or other filters.

Automatic AZ redirection: If the selected AZ is out of stock for a specific offer, the console will now redirect you to another AZ where it is available.
