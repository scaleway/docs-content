This page shows you how to send [metrics](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#metric) and [logs](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#logs) to your [Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#cockpit). The Observability Cockpit provides you with 2 Remote Write endpoints to be able to push metrics and logs. You can push metrics with any `Prometheus Remote Write` compatible agent such as the [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/) or [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) agents.
You can push logs with any Loki compatible agent such as the [Promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/), [Fluentd](https://docs.fluentd.org/), [Fluent Bit](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/) or [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/introduction.html) agents.
