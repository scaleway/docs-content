This page shows you how to manage a container, should you need to verify or edit its deployment parameters after creation. You can deploy a container either from the [Scaleway Container Registry](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/containers/container-registry/quickstart/) or from any other public container registry (DockerHub, AWS Container registries, Gitlab container registry, etc.).

## How to manage a container deployment

### Manage a deployment from the Scaleway Container Registry

1. Click **Containers** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The Containers page displays.
2. Click the relevant containers namespace.
3. Click the name of the container you want to manage.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-manage-container.webp" alt="" />
4. Check or edit any of the following information as required, on the **Container Deployment** tab:
    - Select the **Scaleway** Container Registry.
    - Choose an **image** from your Container Registry. Select the required Container Registry Namespace from the dropdown list, and then select the container and tag.
    - Choose the **Port** your container is listening on. We recommend configuring your container to listen on the **PORT** environment variable.
    - Choose a **name** for your container, and optionally a **description**. The name must only contain alphanumeric characters.
    - Choose the **resources** to be allocated to your container at runtime. These define the performance characteristics of your container.
    - Set your **scaling** preferences, or leave them at default values. The Scaleway platform autoscales the number of available instances of your container to match the incoming load, depending on the settings you define here.
    - Define any **environment variables** you want to inject into your container. For each environment variable, click **+Add** and enter the key/value pair.
    - Add **secrets** for your container. Secrets are are environment variables which are injected into your function, but the values are not retained or displayed by Scaleway after initial validation.
    - Set the desired **privacy policy** for your container. This defines whether container invocation may be done anonymously (**public**) or only via an authentication mechanism provided by the [Scaleway API](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/containers/api/#authentication) (**private**).
    - Optionally, use the **advanced options** to add [triggers](/serverless/containers/concepts/#trigger) to your container deployment. Adding triggers enables the container to handle events coming from sources other than an HTTP endpoint, such as CRON (time-based jobs), MQTT queues and more.
5. Click **Deploy a container** to save any changes you have made.

### Manage a deployment from an external container registry

    - Select the **External** container registry.
    - Enter the public container **image URL** provided by the external registry.
    - Choose the **Port** your container is listening on. We recommend configuring your container to listen on the **PORT** environment variable.
    - Choose a **name** for your container, and optionally a **description**. The name must only contain alphanumeric characters.
