## Introduction

This tutorial is the first of a series of two. You will learn how to set up your environment, then [how to create and deploy functions](/tutorials/transform-bucket-images-triggers-functions-deploy/) to resize images stored in a bucket and push them to another bucket.

Serverless Functions are an asynchronous microservices architecture where event sources are decorrelated from event consumers.

They work best when they are triggered by events stored in queues, which means that they can be edited without having to modify every microservice in the process.

In this tutorial, you will create the following resources to use your functions:

- A project dedicated to this tutorial
- Two buckets to store media
- A queue to manage events
- IAM credentials to secure your environment
- Cockpit to monitor your functions

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).
  - You have around 10 JPG or PNG images.
  - You have [Vim](https://www.vim.org/download.php) installed.

## Creating a New Project

1. Click the **Projects** tab from the [Organization Dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/organization). A list of your Projects displays.
2. Click **+ Create Project** on the right-hand side. A pop-up displays. 
3. Name the project `Functions Tutorial`.
4. Click **Create Project**. The new Project is added to the list. 

## Creating the source bucket

1. Click **Object Storage** under **Storage** on the left side menu of the console. The Object Storage dashboard displays.
3. Click **+ Create a bucket**.
4. Name it `source-images-<YOUR_NAME>`.
5. Choose the **AMSTERDAM** Region.
6. Set the bucket visibility to **Private**.
7. Click **Create Bucket**. The bucket **Files** tab displays.
8. Upload your images to the bucket and select the **Standard** storage class.

## Creating the destination bucket

1. Click **Storage**, then **Object Storage** on the left side menu of the console. The Object Storage dashboard displays.
2. Click **+ Create a bucket**.
3. Name it `dest-images-<YOUR_NAME>`.
4. Chose the **AMSTERDAM** Region.
5. Set the bucket visibility to **Private**.
6. Click **Create Bucket**.

## Creating a Messaging and Queuing namespace

Message queues allow functions to communicate with each other.

1. Click **Messaging** under **Serverless**.
2. Click **Create namespace**.
3. Choose **SQS/SNS** as type.
4. Choose a name or generate one.
5. Click **Create namespace**.

## Generating credentials for the M&Q namespace

1. Click on the namespace you just created.
2. Click **Generate credentials**.
3. Name your credentials `Function Push`.
4. Enable the **Write**, **Read** and **Manage** permissions.
5. Click **Generate credentials**.
6. Store the access key ID and the secret key securely, as you will not be able to access them later.

## Creating a Queue

1. Click the **Queues** tab of your namespace.
2. Click **Create queue**.
3. Select **Standard** as a queue type.
4. Name it `image-queue`. 
5. Keep the default parameters.
6. Click **Create queue**.

## Creating IAM credentials

Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials allow you to secure access to your buckets, functions, etc. 

<Message type="note">
    For this tutorial we will use *User* credentials which are simpler to use. However, for production-grade Serverless applications, we recommend to use *Application* credentials with the minimum possible rights.

1. Click the Organization in the top right corner and Select **API Keys**. The IAM **API keys** tab displays.
2. Click **+ Generate an API key** or the <Icon name="plus" /> button.
3. Select **Myself (IAM)** as the API Key Bearer.
4. Enter `API key for the Function Tutorial` as a description.
5. Set **Expiration** to **One Week**.
6. Select **Yes, set up preferred Project**.
7. Choose the **Functions Tutorial** project (or the name you gave to this project).
8. Click **Generate API Key**.
9. Store the Access key ID and the Secret key securely, as you will not be able to access them later.

## Enabling monitoring with Cockpit

1. Click **Cockpit** under **Observability**.
2. Click **Activate Cockpit**.
3. Click the **Grafana users** tab. 
4. Click **+ Add user**.
5. Enter a username.
6. Select the **Editor** role.
7. Click **Add user**.
8. Store the password securely, as you will not be able to access it later.

## Conclusion

You have now created all the resources to use Serverless Functions.

Setting up an environment with all the necessary resources can be time-consuming. You can use IaC (Infrastructure as Code) tools such as [Terraform](/tutorials/manage-instances-with-terraform-and-functions/) to automate a project's configuration.

Now, let's [create some functions](/serverless/functions/how-to/create-a-function/).
