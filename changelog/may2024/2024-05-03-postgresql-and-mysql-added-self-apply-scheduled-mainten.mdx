Database maintenance operations are set up, run, and scheduled by Scaleway, but you can now select when to apply them to avoid interruptions during peak times.

Refer to the [How to apply maintenance](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/apply-maintenance/) documentation page for more information.
