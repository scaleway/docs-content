Failover IP addresses allow having several IPs on the server and thus, for example, to have one IP for each website or each virtual machine.
Your failover IP can be routed to your servers at any time in just a few minutes by using our Account Management Console or through our API. By switching your failover IP addresses from one server to another, the hosted services remain available without reconfiguring the IP address.

For each server, you can add failover IP addresses according to the offer and your service level.
