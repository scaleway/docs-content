By default, remote SMTP ports (25, 465, and 587) are blocked and cannot be accessed from our infrastructure to prevent spam. To send emails from your Instance, you need to open these ports in the security group configuration.

<Message type="note">
  This document concerns enabling SMTP for Instances. If you want to enable SMTP on other resources, see our documentation on [enabling SMTP on Elastic Metal servers](/elastic-metal/how-to/enable-smtp/) and [enabling SMTP on Public Gateways](/public-gateways/how-to/configure-a-public-gateway/#how-to-enable-smtp).

- At least one [Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/)
- Completed the [identity verification process (KYC)](/account/how-to/verify-identity/)

    <Message type="note">
      If you have not created any security groups, your Instance has been assigned to the default security group, so this will be the one you should modify.
