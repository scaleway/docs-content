When creating a Load Balancer you can now choose whether you want it to be public (connected to the Internet with a public IP address) or private (fully isolated from the Internet and with no public IP address). Private Load Balancers let you balance internal traffic or make your internal services highly available without being exposed to the internet. Make sure you attach your private Load Balancer to a Private Network so your internal clients can access it.
