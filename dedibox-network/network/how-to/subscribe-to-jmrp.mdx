Subscribing to the JMRP (or Junk Mail Reporting Program) allows you to register your IPs with Microsoft's mail delivery system.

This allows you, in case your IP is considered as an emitter of SPAM, to take the actions necessary to stop your IPs from being blacklisted.

By default, authorities refer to the owner of the IP (Online.net) to determine if a mail address is associated with a particular IP.

If you have correctly [configured the reverse DNS of your IP](/dedibox-network/ip-failover/how-to/configure-reverse-dns), you will be able to choose an email address within your domain.

1. Open the [JMRP interface](https://postmaster.live.com/snds/JMRP.aspx) on a browser. 
2. Log in with your Microsoft account. 
3. Enter the required information about your IPs.
4. Select an email address linked to the domain of the reverse.
5. Finalize the subscription.
