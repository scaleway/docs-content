This page shows you how to use [flexible IP addresses](/network/vpc/concepts#flexible-ip) with your Public Gateways.

You can hold flexible IP addresses independently of any Public Gateway, and attach and detach them to/from any of your Public Gateways as you wish. You can keep a number of flexible IP addresses in your account at any given time. 

<Message type="important">

  This how-to concerns the creation of Public Gateway Flexible IPs. For the creation of [Instance Flexible IPs](/compute/instances/how-to/use-flexips/) or [Bare Metal Flexible IPs](/compute/bare-metal-cloud/how-to/configure-flexible-ip/) please see the relevant documentation. Note that each set of Flexible IPs is independent, and usable only with that product. Instance Flexible IPs cannot be attached to Public Gateways and vice versa.
