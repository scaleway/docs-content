Advanced settings allow you to modify the default configuration of your Redis™ Database Instances.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [Redis™ Database Instance](/managed-databases/redis/quickstart/)

<Message type="important">
  Changing the advanced settings can have an impact on the performance of your Database Instance.

1. Click **Redis™** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Click the **Advanced settings** tab.

    To add advanced settings, follow these steps:

    - Click **Add advanced settings**.
    - Select a parameter from the drop-down list. For Redis™ Database Instances, you can configure:
      - `tcp-keepalive` - the period used to send Acknowledgment flags (ACKs), specified in seconds
      - `maxclients` - the maximum number of clients that can be connected at the same time
      - `maxmemory-policy` - parameter that defines how Redis™ selects what data to remove when maximum memory is reached.
    - Configure the value associated with your setting.
    - Click <Icon name="validate" /> to validate.

    You can click **Add parameters** to add and configure other parameters.

    To delete advanced settings:

    - Click <Icon name="delete"/> next to the setting you wish to delete.
    - Click <Icon name="validate"/> to confirm your changes.
