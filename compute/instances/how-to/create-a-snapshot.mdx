The snapshot feature lets you create a backup of a specific [volume](/compute/instances/concepts/#volumes) of your Instance. A snapshot is a full-volume copy stored in our secure data centers. They are usually used to recover volume data or to create a copy of a volume.

<Message type="note">

The snapshot features creates backups of specific volumes only. If you wish to create a backup image which is a complete backup of your Instance including **all** of its volumes, consider using the [backup feature](/compute/instances/how-to/create-a-backup)

5. Enter a name for the volume (or use the default suggested name), and click **Create Volume from Snapshot**

6. Click **Create image from snapshot**. 

The volume is created, and can be viewed in the [Volumes tab](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/volumes). Check out our documentation on [attaching volumes](/storage/block/how-to/attach-a-volume) and [mounting volumes](/storage/block/how-to/mount-and-use-volume) to learn how to use the volume with your Instances.
