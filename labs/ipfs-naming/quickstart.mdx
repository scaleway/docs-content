Created by [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/), InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a decentralized protocol used to store and share content.

Scaleway IPFS Naming allows you to create a key to point to your latest update, and above all maintain this information on the IPFS network and share it through Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs), giving you an extra layer of performance in the region of your choice. This way your records remain available and accessible, even when your local machine is offline.

In this quickstart, we will show you how to create and import an IPNS key and update your records using Scaleway IPFS Naming.
