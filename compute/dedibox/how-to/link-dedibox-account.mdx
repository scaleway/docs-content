    * Payment information will be updated and unified following these rules:
      * If you have SEPA as your preferred payment method in either your Dedibox or Scaleway Cloud account, this SEPA then becomes the default payment method for both your Scaleway Cloud and Scaleway Dedibox invoices.
      * If you do not have a SEPA as your preferred payment method in either account, the preferred payment method of credit card remains the same for both Scaleway Cloud and Scaleway Dedibox invoices.
      * If you use different credit cards for Dedibox and Scaleway Cloud, the card registered with Scaleway Cloud becomes the default payment method for both Scaleway Cloud and Scaleway Dedibox invoices.

          Once account linking has been completed, you can modify your payment method in the [billing section](https://console.scaleway.com/organization/billing) of the Scaleway console. All existing default payment methods will be transferred to your linked account.
