## Are applications deployed on Serverless Containers stateless?

Yes, all applications deployed on Serverless Containers are stateless. This means the server does not store any state about the client session. Instead, the session data is stored on the client and passed to the server as needed. 

## How am I billed for Serverless Containers?

### Principles


Serverless Containers are billed on a pay-as-you-go basis, strictly on resource consumption (Memory and CPU). 

* **Memory consumption:** The memory consumption is obtained by multiplying the memory tiers chosen by the container runtime.
* **vCPU consumption:** The vCPU consumption is obtained by multiplying the vCPU tiers chosen by the container runtime.

For now, these two metrics are divided into 5 tiers:
* 128 MB - 0.07 vCPU
* 256 MB - 0.14 vCPU
* 512 MB - 0.28 vCPU
* 1024 MB - 0.56 vCPU
* 2048 MB - 1.12 vCPU

### Prices 

* **Memory consumption:** €0.10 per 100k GB/s and we provide **400 000 GB/s free tier** per account and per month.
* **vCPU consumption:** €1.0 per 100k vCPU/s after a **200 000 vCPU/s free tier** per account per month.

| Memory  	| CPU       	| Price        	|
|---------	|-----------	|--------------	|
| 128 Mo  	| 0.07 vCPU 	| €0.000000825 	|
| 256 Mo  	| 0.14 vCPU 	| €0.000001650 	|
| 512 Mo  	| 0.28 vCPU 	| €0.000003300 	|
| 1024 Mo 	| 0.56 vCPU 	| €0.000006600 	|
| 2048 Mo 	| 1.12 vCPU 	| €0.000013200 	|

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------	|--------------	|
| Monthly duration                                                         	| 30 000 000 s 	|
| Amount of memory allocated                                               	| 128 Mo       	|
| Amount of vCPU allocated (for now automatic depending on the tier used) 	| 70 mVCPU      	|
| Free Tiers                                                               	| Yes          	|

#### Price calculation

* **Memory consumption**
    * *Allocated Memory conversion:* 128 Mo = 0.125 GB
    * *Resources consumption:* 30 000 000 s * 0.125 GB = 3 750 000 GB/s
    * *Free Tier:* 400 000 GB/s
    * *Billed resources:* 3 750 000 - 400 000 = 3 350 000 GB/s
    * *Cost:* 3 350 000 * €0.0000010 = **€3,35**
* **vCPU consumption**
    * *Allocated vCPU conversion:* 70mVCPU = 0.070 vCPU
    * *Resources consumption:* 30 000 000 s * 0.070 vCPU = 2 100 000 vCPU/s
    * *Free Tier:* 200 000 GB/s
    * *Billed resources:* 2 100 000 - 200 000 = 1 900 000 vCPU/s
    * *Cost:* 1 900 000 * €0.0000100 = **€19,00**

**Monthly Cost: €22,50**

## What are the limitations of Serverless Containers?

Refer to our dedicated page about [Serverless Containers limitations and configuration restrictions](/serverless/containers/reference-content/containers-limitations/) for more information.

## Can I allowlist the IPs of my containers?

Some services need to filter IPs for example databases. Serverless Containers does not support Virtual Private Networks yet but you can use the Scaleway IP Ranges defined in the following link: [http://as12876.net/](http://as12876.net/).```
