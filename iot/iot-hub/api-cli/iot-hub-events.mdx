<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) 
- You have `mosquitto-clients` (mqtt client), and `jq` (json parsing tool) installed on your computer
- You have [installed the Scaleway CLI and read the accompanying IOT document](/iot/iot-hub/api-cli/getting-started-with-iot-hub-cli)

</Message>

Device information, such as events or errors, are reported on your Hub under the default topic prefix `$SCW/events`. For more information on Hub Events, you can read the [IoT Hub events documentation](/iot/iot-hub/how-to/understand-event-messages).

In the following example we will trigger an event by trying to connect without security on a device where security is required.

First, we connect to previously created `dev1` device as _events consumer_
(we want only _error_ events)

```bash
# In one terminal
mosquitto_sub \
  -h $(jq -r '.endpoint' hub.json) -p 1883 \
  -i $(jq -r '.device.id' dev1.json) \
  -t '$SCW/events/error/#'
```

Then we create a secured-only device and try to connect it in insecure mode:

```bash
curl -sS -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" -d '{
    "hub_id": "'$(jq -r '.id' hub.json)'",
    "name": "my_secured_device",
    "allow_insecure": false
  }' $IOT_API/devices > secure-dev.json

jq < secure-dev.json
```

```bash
# In another terminal
mosquitto_pub \
  -h $(jq -r '.endpoint' hub.json) -p 1883 \
  -i $(jq -r '.device.id' secure-dev.json) \
  -t mytopic/mysubtopic \
  -m 'This should fail'
```

dev1 will receive following message, on topic `$SCW/events/device/<secure-dev-id>/error`:

```
{
  "time":"2020-01-17T15:01:29Z",
  "severity": "error",
  "object-type": "device",
  "object-id": "dev3-id",
  "msg":"connection refused because this device requires mutual TLS authentication",
  "packet":"CONNECT: dup: false qos: 0 retain: false rLength: 48"
}
```
