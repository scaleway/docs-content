All servers eventually reach their End of Life (EOL). Hardware vendors provide a warranty and replacement parts for a limited period of time, usually a few years. If and when your Dedibox server is approaching EOL, you will see a warning in the console. This document shows you how to migrate your services and data to your new server.

### When migrating to and from the same OS 

If you are migrating to the same OS version on your new server, you can "just" copy/paste the old server's configuration files to the new one. Most of these are located under `/etc/`, so it is a good idea to back up this entire folder. 

Be advised however that at least some of these configuration files will need adapting for your new machine. One such example is files containing configuration relating to your IP address, if it is statically defined. The same applies to your MAC address. Two files that you might need to modify, for example, are:
 
- `/etc/network/interfaces`
- `/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules`

### When migrating to and from different OSes

In some cases you will be migrating to a newer version of your OS. This usually means that you will need to reconfigure your services. We do not recommend copy/pasting your old configuration files to your new server in this case.
