## What is Scaleway File Storage?

Scaleway File Storage allows you to keep data in an organized hierarchy of files and folders. This hierarchy can be shared across a network, so multiple compute instances can work on the same collection of files.

Refer to the [Quickstart documentation](/file-storage/quickstart/) to get started with Scaleway File Storage.
