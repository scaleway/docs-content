## Where can I find pricing information?
You can find detailed information about the pricing for all of our services on our [pricing page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/).

## What is the authorization charge of €1 for?

We initiate what is called an "authorization charge" of €1 when you register a new credit card. 
This is a dummy transaction to check the validity of the card. The authorization will also carry a 4-digit Magic Code, displayed on your bank account statement. This Magic Code will be used to verify your credit card for your Scaleway account.
For more information refer to [how to add a credit card](/console/my-account/how-to/manage-billing-information/#how-to-add-a-credit-card).

## What forms of payment can I use?

We accept Visa, MasterCard, CB, UnionPay and American Express.

2. Click **Support ticket**.
3. Open a new support ticket.

    From the side menu you can also:

## How do I get in touch with a Solution Advisor? 

If you need help to choose and configure the best solution for you, [get in touch with our Solution Advisors](https://scwexperiences.force.com/contactus/s/?language=en_US).

## How can I reset my password?

If you have lost the password associated with your Scaleway account, you will be able to retrieve access to your account by using the “Lost Password” button on the Scaleway console.
However, if you need to reset your password, but you have difficulties accessing your email account, you will not be able to use this function. In this case, follow the authentication procedure described in our [documentation](/console/my-account/how-to/recover-a-lost-password/). The process is the same if you have activated MFA but [lose your MFA device and backup codes](/console/my-account/how-to/use-2fa/#if-you-lose-your-2fa-device-and-your-backup-codes).

## I cannot log in to the console and I cannot reset my password. How can I contact the support and regain access to my account?

If you have lost access to the Scaleway console and cannot reset your password, you must follow the procedure described [on this page](/console/my-account/how-to/use-2fa/#how-to-regain-access-to-your-account) to regain access to your account.

## What is the difference between an image and a snapshot?

An image is a complete backup of your server including all volumes.
A snapshot can be done from a specific volume (for example you have a server with a volume containing the OS and another one containing the application data, and you want to use different snapshot strategies on both volumes).
Creating snapshots of your volumes gives you total freedom which volumes you want to back up while images are convenient for full backups of your instance.

## Do you offer IPv6?

`/64` IPv6 block are available on all our Instances. However, note that for our legacy servers including `START` and `VC1 /64` IPv6 block is available at the cost of an archive.
The subnetwork is automatically activated on new Instances. To benefit from an IPv6 `/64` subnetwork on an existing Instance, first archive it and then restart it.
