The [Protected Instance](/compute/instances/concepts/#protected-instance) feature is used to prevent any `halt` action from being performed on your Instance. This only applies to running Instances. Enabling the Protected Instance feature means that you will not be able to delete, power off, or reboot your Instance, nor put it into standby mode. This feature is useful to avoid hazardous manipulations, such as batch deletion of Instances.
