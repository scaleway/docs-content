The bucket website feature allows you to host [static websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) using Scaleway [Object Storage](https://www.scaleway.com/en/object-storage/). 

It is possible to enable and configure the bucket website feature via the [AWS-CLI](/storage/object/api-cli/object-storage-aws-cli).


<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) 
  - You have [configured your API keys](/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key)
  - You have [created an Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)

## Enabling the bucket website feature

To use the bucket website feature, you need to enable it on the bucket or buckets you wish to host your website on. 

You can use an API call or the AWS-CLI to enable it using `put-bucket-website`.

### Website JSON grammar

S3 requires you to include index and error pages in your website and to indicate their names in the `bucket-website.json` file.

**Website JSON grammar:**

`IndexDocument` 
    
**Description** 
: suffix of the HTML index document key, commonly named as "index.html".

**Required**
: Yes

**Type**
: string suffix
    
**Value**
: "2012-10-17"

`ErrorDocument` 
    
**Description**
: error document to return when the requested key access is denied or the key does not exist.

**Required**
: No

**Type**
: string

**Sample:**
```json
{
    "IndexDocument" : {
        "Suffix": "index.html"
    },
    "ErrorDocument": {
        "Key": "error.html"
    }
}
```
### PUT bucket website

This operation enables Bucket Website and sets the basic configuration for the website.

```json
PUT /myBucket?website HTTP/1.1
{
    "IndexDocument" : {
        "Suffix": "index.html"
    },
    "ErrorDocument": {
        "Key": "error.html"
    }
}
``` 
To enable bucket website via the CLI, you can create a file called `bucket-website.json` with the index and error page names.

```json
{
    "IndexDocument" : {
        "Suffix": "index.html"
    },
    "ErrorDocument": {
        "Key": "error.html"
    }
}
```
And upload it using the following command:

```
$ aws s3api put-bucket-website --bucket <BUCKET_NAME> --website-configuration file://bucket-website.json
```

### GET bucket website

To visualize the configuration of your website, retrieve it using `get-bucket-website`.

**Sample request**
```
GET /myBucket?website HTTP/1.1
```
**CLI command**
```
$ aws s3api get-bucket-website --bucket <BUCKET_NAME>
```
### DELETE bucket website

This operation deletes the Bucket Website configuration of a specified bucket.

<Message type="note">

  If the operation is successful no output will be returned.

</Message>

**Sample request**
```
DELETE /MyBucket?website HTTP/1.1
```
**CLI command**
```
$ aws s3api delete-bucket-website --bucket myBucket
```
## Configuring your website 

After setting up the basic bucket website configuration with `put-bucket-website`, upload the `index.html` and the `error.html` files to your bucket. 

You can also upload the rest of the static web page files that make up your website. 

>**Note:** If this is your first time uploading objects into a bucket, you can follow the step-by-step on [this documentation page](/storage/object/how-to/upload-files-into-a-bucket/).

### Configuring access

If you want your website to be accessible, you need to set up a bucket policy.

1. Set the `"Action"` as `"s3:GetObject"` in the `bucket-policy.json` file,

2. Specify which resources they can access under `"Resource"`:

- `"<BUCKET_NAME>/*"` - Grants access to all objects inside a bucket, but not to the bucket itself. 
- `"<BUCKET_NAME>/<PREFIX>/*"` - Grants access only to objects with the specified prefix inside a bucket, but not to the bucket itself. For example, if you apply a bucket policy that specifies `"my_files/movie/*"` under **Resource**, you would grant access to all objects with the `movie/` prefix, but not to other objects in `my_files/` bucket. 

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id":"MyBucketPolicy",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "DelegateAccess",
            "Effect":"Allow",
            "Principal":"*",
            "Action":[
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource":[
                "<BUCKET_NAME>/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
``` 
3 . Use [PUT Bucket Policy](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-operations#put-bucket-policy) or run the following command to implement the policy via the AWS-CLI:

```
$ aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket <BUCKET_NAME> --policy file://bucket-policy.json
``` 
### Configuring your URL

You can access your website using the website endpoint of your bucket, generated by s3 under the default format:

`https://<bucket_name>.s3-website.<bucket_region>.scw.cloud`

Replace `<bucket_name>` and `<bucket_region>` accordingly. 

Alternatively, you can [configure a CNAME Record](/en/docs/tutorials/s3-customize-url-cname/) for your bucket URL, to be able to access the website through a domain name of your choice.
