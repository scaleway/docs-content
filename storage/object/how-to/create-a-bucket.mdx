Object Storage allows you to store different types of objects (documents, images, videos, etc.) and distribute them instantly, anywhere in the world.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner/) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission/) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization


To get started with Object Storage, you must first create a bucket. Objects are gathered into buckets. Each bucket represents a space where objects are stored.

1. Click **Object Storage** on the left side menu of the console. The Object Storage dashboard displays.
2. Click **+ Create bucket**. The bucket creation page displays.
3. Select the geographical location in which to create your bucket.  Scaleway Object Storage is currently available in three Regions.
    - Amsterdam, The Netherlands:
      - Region: `nl-ams`
    - Paris, France:
      - Region: `fr-par`
    - Warsaw, Poland:
      - Region: `pl-waw`
4. Check **Public** or **Private** to define the bucket visibility. The bucket visibility specifies whether everyone can see the list of objects in the bucket. It does not affect [object visibility](/storage/object/concepts/#visibility/).
    <Message type="note">
      A file uploaded to a public bucket is private by default.
      A private file stored in a public bucket is not publicly accessible.
      You can change the bucket visibility at any time from the **Bucket settings** tab.
    </Message>
5. Select a use case for your bucket.
6. Enable [bucket versioning](/storage/object/how-to/use-bucket-versioning/) if you want to store multiple versions of your objects (this may lead to higher storage costs).
7. If applicable, you can tick the **Activate 90-day free trial** to benefit from 750 GB of free [Multi-AZ class storage](/faq/objectstorage/#what-are-the-object-storage-classes-offered-by-scaleway/) for buckets in your Organization, across all regions. Refer to our [dedicated FAQ](/faq/objectstorage/#how-can-i-benefit-from-the-object-storage-free-trial/) for more information.
8. Enter a name for your bucket. 
9. Optionally, you can use the cost estimator to simulate your Object Storage costs.
10. Click **Create bucket** to confirm. A list of your buckets displays, showing the newly created bucket.

You can find more information about your bucket by clicking on its name in the **Buckets** list and then on the **Bucket settings** tab.
