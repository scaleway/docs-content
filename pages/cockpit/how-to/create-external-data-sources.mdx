This page shows you how to create a **custom** [data source](/cockpit/concepts/#data-sources) and its [data type](/cockpit/concepts/#data-types), from the Scaleway console.

<Macro id="requirements" />

  - A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

1. Click **Cockpit** in the **Monitoring** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Cockpit** overview page displays.
2. Click the **Data sources** tab.
3. Click **+ Create custom data source**.
4. Enter a name for the data source.
5. Choose the [data type](/cockpit/concepts/#data-types) you want to create in the data source.
6. Select the region for your data source.
    <Message type="tip">
      We recommend that you create your data sources in the same regions as the alert manager if you want to receive alerts for them.
    </Message>
7. Drag the slider to adjust the [retention period](/cockpit/concepts/#retention) for your data source:
    - Drag the slider to the **right to increase** your retention period, or
    - Drag the slider to the **left to decrease** the retention period.
        <Message type="important">
         - Reducing the retention period of a data source will permanently delete all observability data in that data source beyond the selected timeframe. This deletion is irreversible and takes effect a few minutes after the retention period is reduced, even if the retention period is later increased.
         - Find out about the [retention periods available for each data source type](/cockpit/concepts/#retention).
