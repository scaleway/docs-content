You can change the model used by your Managed Inference deployment at any time. Follow the steps below to change the model using the Scaleway console:

<Requirements />

  - A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - A [Managed Inference deployment](/managed-inference/quickstart/)
  - [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

1. Click **Managed Inference** in the **AI** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. A list of your deployments displays.
2. From the drop-down menu, select the geographical region you want to manage.
3. Choose a deployment either by clicking its name, or selecting **More info** from the drop-down menu represented by the icon <Icon name="more" /> to access the deployment dashboard.
4. Click the **Settings** tab of your deployment to display additional settings.
5. In the **Model** panel, click **Change model**. 
    A pop-up displays, showing your current model.
6. From the drop-down menu, select the model you want to change to, and click **Change model**.
    <br/> <br/>
    The change of model is initiated. Note that while the model is changed, your deployment will not be available for 15 - 30 minutes.
