Migrating virtual machines from one platform to another can be a complex process, especially when moving from a proprietary environment like VMware to a cloud-based infrastructure like Scaleway.
However, with the right tools and a step-by-step approach, you can successfully migrate your VMware virtual machines to Scaleway Instances, taking advantage of the scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness of the cloud.

This guide will walk you through the process of migrating your VMware virtual machines to Scaleway Instances, covering everything from preparing your Scaleway Instance to managing the migration, converting VMDK files to QCOW2,
uploading the QCOW2 image to Scaleway Object Storage, and finally, creating an image from the imported volume and booting an instance with the image.
By following these steps, you'll be able to seamlessly migrate your VMware virtual machines to Scaleway Instances, ensuring minimal downtime and optimal performance.

## Validating the inventory of machines to migrate

Identify the virtual machines (VMs) to migrate on your VMware plattform:

- Disk configuration (number, size, type)
- Network configuration (number of NICs, type)
- Boot type (BIOS or UEFI)


## Preparing a Scaleway Instance to manage the migration

1. [Create a new Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) to handle the migration and log into it [using SSH](/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).
2. Install the following CLI tools, required for the migration of your virtual machine:
   - `qemu-img` — for converting VMDK to QCOW2
      ```sh
      apt install qemu-utils
      ```
   - `scw` — for Scaleway operations
      ```sh
      curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/master/scripts/get.sh | sh
      ```
   - `aws` — for uploading to S3
      ```
      curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
      unzip awscliv2.zip
      sudo ./aws/install
      ```
   - `govmomi` — for interacting with vCenter
     ```
     curl -L -o - "https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/releases/latest/download/govc_$(uname -s)_$(uname -m).tar.gz" | tar -C /usr/local/bin -xvzf - govc
     ```

3. Configure credentials for the tools:
   - For Scaleway: `scw init`
   - For AWS/S3: Refer to [Using Object Storage with the AWS-CLI](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/object-storage/api-cli/object-storage-aws-cli/)
   - For vCenter: credentials and VPN (if needed):
      ```
      export GOVC_PASSWORD=<VMware password>
      export GOVC_USERNAME=root
      export GOVC_INSECURE=1
      export GOVC_URL=<VMware host>
      ```

## Downloading VMDK files using govmomi

Download the VMDK file from vCenter:

```bash
govc export.ovf -vm <vm_name> /path/to/image
```

<Message type="note">
  Adjust this based on your `govmomi`/`govc` setup and environment.
</Message>

## Converting the VMDK file to QCOW2**

Convert the downloaded VMDK file to QCOW2 using `qemu-img`:

```bash
qemu-img convert -O qcow2 <vm_name>.vmdk <vm_name>.qcow2
```

### (Optional): Mounting the QCOW2 file and system configuration

1. Mount the QCOW2 image on your Instance:
  ```bash
  modprobe nbd
  qemu-nbd -c /dev/nbd0 <vm_name>.qcow2
  ```
  Make any changes (e.g., install cloud-init, remove VMware tools).


2. Unmount the file:

```bash
qemu-nbd -d /dev/nbd0
```

## Uploading the QCOW2 image to Scaleway Object Storage

Upload the converted disk:

```bash
aws s3 cp <vm_name>.qcow2 s3://<bucket_name>/
```

## Importing the QCOW2 image from Object Storage into Scaleway as a SBS snaphot

Import into a new snapshot:

```bash
scw instance snapshot create zone=fr-par-1 name=<my-imported-snapshot> volume-type=b_ssd bucket=<my-bucket> key=<my-qcow2-file-name.qcow2>
```


## (Optional) Create Private Networks if needed



## Booting an instance with the image and attaching the PN

Create a new server:

```bash
scw instance server create \
  name=<instance_name> \
  image-id=<image_id> \
  commercial-type=<type> \
  zone=<zone>
```

Start the server:

```bash
scw instance server start server-id=<server_id> zone=<zone>
```
