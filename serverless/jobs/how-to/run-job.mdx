2. Click the name of the job you want to run. The job **Overview** tab displays.
3. Click the **Actions** button, then click **Run job** in the drop-down menu. Your job starts, and a new entry appears in the **Job runs** section.

    - A start date and an end date
    - The duration of the job execution
