Users can connect to a database and access its data. Each one has a different set of customizable permissions.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [PostgreSQL or MySQL Database Instance](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/quickstart/)

## How to create a user

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Select the geographical region of the Instance you want to manage from the drop-down.
3. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
4. Go to the **Users** tab. A list of users displays. If it is the first time you create a user, your list will display the user you set up during the creation of your Database Instance.
5. Click **+ Create user** to create a new user, if you wish to.
6. Click <Icon name="toggle" /> to grant admin rights to the user.
    <Message type="note">
      Admin rights allow a user to create logical databases and users. These right do not override the permissions configured for the logical databases. Logical database permissions must be set up in the Permissions tab.
    </Message>
7. Enter a **username** and **password**.
    <Message type="note">
      Optionally, you can configure the appropriate permissions according to the user.
      Three types of permissions are available:
        - **None:** No access to the database,
        - **Read:** Allow users to read tables and fields in a database,
        - **Write:** Allow users to write content in databases.
      You can select the permission type in the Permissions tab.

    </Message>

    <Message type="important">
      Permissions are applied on existing items **at the moment the configuration is set**, and not applied to any items created afterward.
      When you modify your Database configuration, your configured permissions are automatically set to **Custom**. The **Custom** setting ensures that your permissions are still valid for items created before you reconfigured your Database.
      Any items created after you change your configuration will not have permissions applied to them, you must set new permissions.
    </Message>
8. Click **Create user** to confirm.

    Once the user is created, it is displayed in the user list.

To update the password, the permissions or delete the user, click <Icon name="more" /> to display the respective options.

## Set permissions for an existing user

Permissions define the actions a user can perform on a logical database. A database user is generated automatically when you create your Database Instance and this user is attributed all permissions. However, newly created users have no permissions by default.

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Select the geographical region of the Instance you want to manage from the drop-down.
3. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
4. Go to the **Users** tab. A list of users displays.
5. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Update permissions** to open the user permissions panel.
6. Select the appropriate permissions for each database.
    <Message type="note">
      Three types of permissions are available:
        - **None:** No access to the database
        - **Read:** Allow users to read tables and fields in a database
        - **Write:** Allow users to write content in databases

    </Message>
7. Click **Update user** to confirm.
