<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net)
  - You have [created](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/order-a-server) a Dedibox dedicated server
  - You have [requested](/dedibox-network/ipv6/how-to/request-prefix) a /48 IPv6 prefix
</Message>

You can split your IPv6 prefix into several subnets and use them on your Dedibox servers both in Paris and Amsterdam. Each subnet has its own [DUID](/dedibox-network/ipv6/concepts/#duid) and can be configured individually.

<Message type="note">
  * You can create as many /56 subnets as you have servers.
  * You can create as many /64 subnets as you have failover IPs.
</Message>

1. Click **Server** > **Network configuration** in the Dedibox console. The network configuration pages displays. Scroll down to the IPv6 network configuration section.
2. Click the cogwheel next to your `/48` prefix. Then click **Create subnet**.

3. Select the subnet you want to create from the drop-down list. Then click **Create subnet**

    The subnet is created and visible in the list of your IPv6 subnets along with its DUID.

<Message typ="tip">
  To create `/64` networks for virtual machines, repeat the steps above by clicking on the cogweel icon next to the `/56` subnet.
