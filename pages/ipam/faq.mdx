## What is IPAM?

**IP** **A**ddress **M**anager (IPAM) is Scaleway's tool for planning, tracking, and managing the IP address space of Scaleway products. It acts as a single source of truth for the IP addresses of Scaleway resources. Managed products, such as Databases and Load Balancer, are fully integrated into IPAM, and Private Networks' [DHCP server](/vpc/concepts/#dhcp) uses IPAM to assign private, static IP addresses to attached resources.

## What can I do with IPAM?

The public rollout of IPAM functionality is being carried out gradually. IPAM is now in General Availability, offering several different functionalities in the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/ipam/), including viewing, tagging and filtering all your [private IP addresses](/ipam/concepts/#private-ip-address). You can also [reserve](/ipam/how-to/reserve-ip/) a private IP on one of your Private Networks and use it to attach a specified resource to the network.

Management of public (flexible) IP addresses with IPAM is planned for the future.

## Can I use a reserved private IP to attach any kind of managed resource to a Private Network?

Currently, the Scaleway console only supports attachment with a reserved IP for Instances, Load Balancers, Public Gateways, and Elastic Metal servers. Support for Managed Databases will be coming soon.

## Can I use a reserved private IP with a virtual machine hosted on my Elastic Metal server?

Yes, this functionality is now available via the Scaleway console and API. Simply reserve an IP with IPAM, then select it when [attaching a custom resource to a Private Network](/vpc/how-to/attach-resources-to-pn/).
