## Arq Backup Overview

[Arq Backup](https://www.arqbackup.com/index.html) automatically backs up Macs and PCs to cloud storage while encrypting the data in an [open and documented format](https://www.arqbackup.com/arq_data_format.txt).

In this tutorial you learn how to back up your PC or Mac computer to Object Storage using Arq Backup, using version 7 of the application.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-arq7_create_backup.webp" alt="" />
7. Select **S3-Compatible Server** as storage location and click **OK**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-arq7_s3.webp" alt="" />
8. Enter the Object Storage credentials:
    - **Server URL:** The URL of the Object Storage endpoint:
      - For FR-PAR (Paris, France) enter `https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud`
      - For NL-AMS (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) enter `https://s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud`
      - For PL-WAW (Warsaw, Poland) enter `https://s3.pl-waw.scw.cloud`
    - **Access Key ID:** The [Access Key](/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key/) of the API key used for authentication
    - **Secret Key:** The [Secret Key](/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key/) of the API key used for authentication

9. Choose the bucket for storing backups. Two options are proposed:
    - Create a new bucket

10. Create the new backup plan using the previously configured storage location. Click **Continue** to confirm:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-arq7_choose_storage.webp" alt="" />
11. Configure a optional password to increase the security of your backups. You will need this password to decrypt your data. Tick the checkbox and enter your password and its confirmation, then click **Continue** to confirm:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-arq7_password.webp" alt="" />

    <Message type="important">
      Make a note of the password and keep it in a safe place. It is not possible to decrypt a backup without having the password. You can restore backups using the Arq Backup application, or an open source [restore tool](https://arqbackup.github.io/arq_restore/).
    </Message>

    A summary of your configuration displays.
12. Click **Create** to validate the settings and to create the new backup plan:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-arq7_summary.webp" alt="" />

    The status of the new backup plan displays. By default Arq makes an hourly backup of the entire disk of your computer: 
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-arq7_status.webp" alt="" />

    If required, the backup frequency and the files and folders to backup can be adjusted from the backup plan preferences by clicking on **Edit** in the plan details:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-arq7_edit_plan.webp" alt="" />

### Restoring Files

1. Go to the **Restore Files** section of Arq
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-arq7_restore.webp" alt="" />
2.  Expand the menu on the left to see a list of all backups. They are sorted by the time/date of their creation. Click the desired backup, and the contents of the backup appear on the right.
    - Click the Item to restore, then click the **Restore...** button.
    - Choose if you want to restore the item in its original location, on the desktop, or in another specific location. Tick the checkbox if you want to overwrite existing files, then click **Restore**.
    - Arq may prompt for an administrator username and password to avoid permission issues when restoring files.

    Alternatively it is possible to restore files anywhere by dragging-and-dropping them from the backup window to the desktop or a Finder window

For advanced configuration options, refer to the [official documentation](https://www.arqbackup.com/docs/).
