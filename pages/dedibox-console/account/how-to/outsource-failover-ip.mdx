Outsourcing a Dedibox dedicated server and its allocated failover IPs allows another Dedibox user to manage these resources on your behalf.

1. In the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net/), navigate to **Server** > **Network configuration** from the top menu. This will display a list of your allocated failover IPs.
2. Locate the failover IP you intend to outsource. Click the settings icon (typically a gear icon) next to the selected IP. A drop-down menu will appear.
3. Select **Outsourcing** from the drop-down menu. This will open the outsourcing form, where you can specify the new technical contact.
4. Enter the **identifier** (login) of the Dedibox user who will manage the failover IP in the outsourcing form. Ensure that the identifier corresponds to the other user's Dedibox console account. Complete the form by providing any additional required details.
5. Click **Send request** to submit the outsourcing request. 
6. The recipient of the failover IP will receive a notification, prompting them to accept or decline the outsourcing request. Once accepted, the management of the failover IP will be transferred to their account.

<Message type="important">
  By outsourcing the failover IP, you are granting another user full management rights over the IP, including network configuration and troubleshooting.
