Savings plans provide a flexible pricing structure designed to optimize costs. By committing to consistent usage, you unlock substantial discounts compared to pay-as-you-go models, resulting in significant long-term savings. Savings plans are available for Compute resources.

For more details about how Savings plans work, how they are billed and which resources are covered, refer to the [Understanding savings plans](/billing/additional-content/understanding-savings-plans/) documentation page.
