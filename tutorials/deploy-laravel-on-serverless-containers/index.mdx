This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide for deploying a containerized Laravel application on the Scaleway cloud platform. It covers the entire process, from setting up the required infrastructure to building and deploying the application using Docker and Scaleway services. The tutorial aims to help developers easily deploy their Laravel applications on Scaleway by providing clear instructions and best practices.

## Why Scaleway is suitable for deploying containerized applications:
Scaleway provides a seamless environment for running and managing containers, offering features such as [Container Registry](https://www.scaleway.com/en/container-registry/), [Serverless Containers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/serverless-containers/), [Messaging & Queuing](https://www.scaleway.com/en/messaging-and-queuing/) and [Observability](https://www.scaleway.com/en/cockpit/). By combining the benefits of containerization with Scaleway's platform, developers should be able to easily deploy, scale, and manage their applications efficiently.

<Message type="tip">
[Serverless Containers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/serverless-containers/) offers significant advantages when deploying Laravel applications over [Serverless Functions](https://www.scaleway.com/en/serverless-functions/), as it provides the flexibility to customize the runtime environment according to your specific needs.

## Creating a SQS/SNS queue
Laravel applications make use of [queues](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/queues) to process long-running jobs in the background. As this feature of the Laravel framework is nearly always used, we will configure it and leverage the [Messaging & Queuing](https://www.scaleway.com/en/messaging-and-queuing/) product from Scaleway. The [Scaleway documentation](/serverless/messaging/quickstart/) provides clear information on how this managed service works and can be configured.

1. Create a SQS/SNS namespace: we will create a `SQS/SNS` namespace in the `PAR` region.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-serverless-messaging.webp" alt="Scaleway Console Messaging and Queuing Namespace" />

2. Create a queue. In this example, we create a `Standard` queue (At-least-once delivery, the order of messages is not preserved) with the default parameters. This queue will be the default queue used by our application.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-serverless-messaging-queue.webp" alt="Scaleway Console Messaging and Queuing Queue" />
    
3. Generate credentials. In this example, we generate the credentials with `read` and `write` access.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-serverless-messaging-credential.webp" alt="Scaleway Console Messaging and Queuing Credential" />

## Building the Laravel Docker Image

In this section, we will focus on building the containerized image. With Docker, we have a convenient way to package our application along with its dependencies and configurations, ensuring consistency and portability across different environments.

1. Create the Dockerfile: we create a `Dockerfile` which is a text file that contains instructions for Docker to build the image. In this example, we specify the base image as `php:fpm-alpine`, install and enable the necessary php dependencies with [`install-php-extensions`](https://github.com/mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer), and determine the commands to be executed at startup.

    ```
    # Dockerfile
    FROM --platform=linux/amd64 php:8.2.6-fpm-alpine3.18

    ARG IPE_GD_WITHOUTAVIF=1

    ADD https://github.com/mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer/releases/latest/download/install-php-extensions /usr/local/bin/

    RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/install-php-extensions && \
        install-php-extensions bcmath gd gettext intl mcrypt mysqli opcache pcntl pdo_mysql pdo_pgsql soap sockets redis xsl zip

    RUN apk --update add \
        supervisor \
        nginx &&\
        rm /var/cache/apk/*

    COPY --chown=www-data:www-data . /var/www/html

    COPY stubs/nginx /etc/nginx
    COPY stubs/php /usr/local/etc
    COPY stubs/supervisor /etc/supervisor

    RUN mkdir -p /var/run/php

    RUN php artisan config:cache

    EXPOSE 80

    CMD ["/usr/bin/supervisord", "-c", "/etc/supervisor/conf.d/supervisord.conf"]
    ```
2. Create the supervisor configuration file. [Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/) is a reliable and efficient process control system for managing and monitoring processes. This is used as there are multiple processes running within the container. In this example, we create a `stubs/supervisor/supervisord.conf` file with the following configuration to start the web server Nginx, the php-fpm pool, and 5 workers:
    ```
    # stubs/supervisor/supervisord.conf
    [supervisord]   
    nodaemon=true
    logfile=/dev/null
    logfile_maxbytes=0
    pidfile=/run/supervisord.pid

    [program:php-fpm]
    command=php-fpm -F
    stdout_logfile=/dev/stdout
    stdout_logfile_maxbytes=0
    stderr_logfile=/dev/stderr
    stderr_logfile_maxbytes=0
    autorestart=false
    startretries=0

    [program:nginx]
    command=nginx -g 'daemon off;'
    stdout_logfile=/dev/stdout
    stdout_logfile_maxbytes=0
    stderr_logfile=/dev/stderr
    stderr_logfile_maxbytes=0
    autorestart=false
    startretries=0

    [program:worker]
    process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d
    command=php /var/www/html/artisan queue:work sqs --sleep=3 --tries=3 --max-time=3600
    stdout_logfile=/dev/stdout
    stdout_logfile_maxbytes=0
    stderr_logfile=/dev/stderr
    stderr_logfile_maxbytes=0
    autostart=true
    autorestart=true
    stopasgroup=true
    killasgroup=true
    user=www-data
    numprocs=5
    stopwaitsecs=3600
    ```

3. Create web server configuration files. Nginx will be used to serve the static assets and to forward the requests to the php-fpm pool for processing. In this example, we create the following configuration files `stubs/nginx/http.d/default.conf` and `stubs/nginx/nginx.conf`.

    ```
    # stubs/nginx/http.d/default.conf
    server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;
        server_name _;
        root /var/www/html/public;
    
        add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
        add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";
    
        index index.php;
    
        charset utf-8;
    
        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
        }
    
        location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
        location = /robots.txt  { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
    
        error_page 404 /index.php;
    
        location ~ \.php$ {
            fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $realpath_root$fastcgi_script_name;
            include fastcgi_params;
        }
    
        location ~ /\.(?!well-known).* {
            deny all;
        }
    }
    ```

    ```
    # stubs/nginx/nginx.conf
    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log notice;
    events {
        worker_connections 1024;
    }
    http {
        default_type application/octet-stream;
        gzip on;
        include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
        include /etc/nginx/http.d/*.conf;
        keepalive_timeout 65;
        log_format main '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local "$request" ' '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" ' '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';
        access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log  main;
        sendfile on;
    }
    pid /var/run/nginx.pid;
    user nginx;
    worker_processes auto;
    ``` 

4. Create the php-fpm configuration file. The configuration `stubs/php/php-fpm.d/zz-docker.conf` file should be created, and the php-fpm pool configured to render the dynamic pages of the Laravel application. Depending on the needs of your application, you might have to fine-tune the configuration of the process manager. Further information is available in the [php manual](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.configuration.php).
    
    ``` 
    [global]
    daemonize = no

    [www]
    listen = /var/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock
    listen.owner = www-data
    listen.group = www-data
    listen.mode = 0660

    pm = dynamic 
    pm.max_children = 75 
    pm.start_servers = 10 
    pm.min_spare_servers = 5 
    pm.max_spare_servers = 20 
    pm.process_idle_timeout = 10s
    ```

5. Build the docker image. 
    ```
    docker build -t my-image .
    ```

## Creating Container Registry 

1. [Create a Scaleway Container Registry namespace](/containers/container-registry/how-to/create-namespace/) in the `PAR` region. Set the visibility to `Private` to avoid having your container retrieved without proper authentication and authorization.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-serverless-containers-namespace.webp" alt="Scaleway Console Container Registry Namespace" />

2. Run the following command in your local terminal to log in to the newly created Container Registry.
    ```
    docker login rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/namespace-zen-feistel -u nologin --password-stdin <<< "$SCW_SECRET_KEY"
    ```

    <Message type="important">
      To run this example, create an API key in the API keys tab of your Identity and Access Management dashboard. Then, replace the expression `$SCW_SECRET_KEY` with the secret key element of the API key. [Create an API key](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/api-keys)
    </Message>

2. Tag the image and push it to the Container Registry namespace.
    
    ```
    docker tag my-image rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/namespace-zen-feistel/my-image:v1
    docker push rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/namespace-zen-feistel/my-image:v1
    ```

## Deploying the Serverless Container
The Scaleway documentation website provides a Quickstart on how to [create and manage a Serverless Container Namespace](/serverless/containers/quickstart/).

1. Create a Serverless Containers namespace. In this example, we create the `my-laravel-application` namespace and configure the environment variables and secrets necessary for our application. In particular, we must add all the variables needed to connect to the previously created SQS/SNS queue.
    
    By default, Laravel expects the following environment variables/secrets to be filled in for queues: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`, `QUEUE_CONNECTION`, `SQS_PREFIX` and `SQS_QUEUE`.

2. Deploy the application. Click **+ Deploy a Container** once the namespace is created, and follow the instructions of the creation wizard. Select the registry namespace and the previously uploaded Docker image and configure the listening port (Nginx web server is listening on port 80). For the CPU and memory, define at least 560mVPCU and 256 MB respectively. To reduce the limitations due to [cold start](/serverless/containers/concepts/#cold-start), we will run at least 1 instance.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-serverless-container.webp" alt="Scaleway Console Deploy Container" />

3. Review the logs to confirm that our application is running as expected, and review the logs to check if the supervisor started and spawned nginx, php-fpm and workers. This step is optional.

    ```
    INFO spawned: 'worker_00' with pid 4
    INFO spawned: 'php-fpm' with pid 3
    INFO spawned: 'nginx' with pid 2
    INFO supervisord started with pid 1
    ```

## Customizing the endpoint name (optionally)

Serverless Containers come with a default endpoint name. You can customize this to a name of your choice using the **Endpoints** feature.

1. Click the **Endpoints** tab. The endpoint information displays. 
2. Click **+ Add new Endpoints**. A pop-up displays. 
3. Enter the name of your endpoint. You can use any domain or subdomain that you already own. Click **Add Endpoint** to validate.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-serverless-endpoint.webp" alt="Scaleway Console Container Endpoint" />


A new endpoint displays in the list of endpoints. You can now access the application using your custom endpoint name.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-serverless-laravel.webp" alt="Browsing to Laravel default home page" />

## Enabling monitoring and load testing (optionally)

By default, some metrics will be available in the Scaleway console. However, to better understand how your application behaves under load, you can enable [Scaleway Cockpit](https://www.scaleway.com/en/cockpit/).

To test the load on the application, there is a basic test route that pushes a job into the queue and returns the welcome page.

``` php
# routes/web.php
use App\Jobs\ProcessPodcast;

Route::get('/test', function () {

    ProcessPodcast::dispatch();

    return view('welcome');
});
```
The job does nothing but to wait for a couple of seconds.

``` php
# app/Jobs/ProcessPodcast

class ProcessPodcast implements ShouldQueue
{
    public function handle(): void
    {
        sleep(2);
    }
}
```
Then, use `hey` to send 400 requests (20 concurrent requests) to this route.

```
hey -n 400 -q 20 https://example.com/test
```

We can see that our deployment is not sufficiently sized to handle such workload and the response times are far from ideal. 

```

However, in the background, the infrastructure starts to scale up and the number of containers becomes enough to handle new requests.

Relaunch the test to confirm that all requests have succeeded thanks to autoscaling.
