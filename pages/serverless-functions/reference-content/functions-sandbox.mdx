In the context of Scaleway Serverless Functions, a [Sandbox environment](/serverless-functions/concepts/#sandbox) is a critical security mechanism that isolates each function from others, ensuring that they operate in a secure and controlled space. Functions run in dedicated execution environments that prevent unauthorized access and potential interference between different resources.

Scaleway Serverless Functions offers two sandbox environment options:

- Sandbox v1 (legacy)
- Sandbox v2 (recommended)

## Sandbox v1

Sandbox v1 is Serverless Functions' legacy sandboxing environment with slower [cold starts](/serverless-functions/concepts/#cold-start), but fully supports Linux system call interface.

<Message type="important">
Sandbox v1 is known to experience clock drift over time. A difference of approximately **two seconds** can be observed after 24 hours of uninterrupted execution. This issue especially affects long-running functions, whereas short-lived functions are much less impacted. Update to sandbox v2 to solve the issue.

## Sandbox v2

Sandbox v2 is a modern isolation environment that relies on [gVisor](https://gvisor.dev/). This option offers faster [cold starts](/serverless-functions/concepts/#cold-start), but only implements a selection of Linux syscalls.
Refer to the [official gVisor documentation](https://gvisor.dev/docs/user_guide/compatibility/linux/amd64/) for a comprehensive list of supported syscalls.

## Sandbox special directories

In Sandbox v1 and v2, some directories are mounted as `tmpfs` for temporary in-memory storage:

| Sandbox v1 |Sandbox v2 |
|---|---|
| /dev (max size: 65 536 KB) | /dev (no max size)|
| | /tmp (no max size) |

In Sandbox v1, the size is limited, and its impact on memory usage is negligible.

In Sandbox v2, directories such as `/tmp` and `/dev` are stored in memory. This means that any data written to `/tmp` consumes RAM directly. For example, writing a 100 MB file to `/tmp` will increase the function's memory usage by the same amount.

Since this usage counts toward the function's memory limit, excessive writes to `/tmp` can lead to out-of-memory (OOM) errors, potentially triggering a function restart.

To avoid this, we recommend being cautious when writing temporary files in `/tmp`, especially in long-running or high-throughput workloads.

Applications that rely heavily on temporary file storage should either:
- Use alternative storage paths within your function
- Increase the function's memory allocation to accommodate for temporary file usage
