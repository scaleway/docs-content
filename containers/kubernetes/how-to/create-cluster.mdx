Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule provides a managed environment for you to create, configure and run a cluster of preconfigured machines for containerized applications. You will be able to create [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) clusters without the complexity of managing the infrastructure.

The service offers full flexibility such as:
  * Scaling the number of pods depending on the workload.
  * Managing your cluster easily via the [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/)

To administrate your Kubernetes Cluster easily, Scaleway provides a `.kubeconfig` file that allows you to manage your cluster from your local computer by using `kubectl`. [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) is the command line interface for running commands against Kubernetes clusters.

</Message>

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The Kubernetes dashboard displays.
2. Click **Create cluster**. The first page of the cluster creation wizard displays.
3. This page concerns the configuration of your cluster. Enter the following information:
    * The **cluster type**. Select **Kubernetes Kapsule** cluster to create a cluster using exclusively Scaleway Instances.
      <Message type="note">
        This document concerns the creation and management of a **Kubernetes Kapsule** cluster. To create a Kubernetes Kosmos cluster, refer to the [Kubernetes Kosmos documentation](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-kosmos-cluster/)
      </Message>
    * The geographical **region** of the cluster.
    * The Kubernetes **version** for the cluster.
4. Configure the **regional Private Network** for the cluster. A Private Network allows your cluster to communicate in an isolated and secure network. Each cluster is autoconfigured using a /22 IP subnet.
   You can either:
    * Attach an existing regional Private Network (VPC) within the same Availability Zone from the drop-down.
    * Attach a new regional Private Network to the cluster.
    <Message type="important">
      The regional Private Network of your cluster can not be detached, and the cluster can not be moved to another Private Network after creation.
    </Message>
5. Enter the **name** for the cluster and optionally a description and tags, which can help you to organize your cluster.
6. Click **Next**. The second page of the Kapsule cluster creation wizard displays.
7. This page concerns the settings for your cluster's pool. Enter the following information:
    * The **Availability Zone** in which all your pool's nodes will be created.
    * The **node type** you require.
    * The configuration for your **node options**, including the number of nodes and whether to enable autoscale. You can also choose whether to enable auto-heal and whether to link the cluster to a placement group. Alternatively, you can leave these options at default values.
8. Click **Create cluster**. Your cluster is being deployed. Once the cluster is ready, it appears in the Clusters List.
