This page gives details about the conditions you must meet to register domain names with Scaleway Domains & DNS. Requirements vary depending on the domain extension (TLD).

## General requirements (for all extensions)

- Your domain name must not exceed 63 alphanumeric characters (before the dot and without the extension)
- Domain names cannot begin or end with a hyphen (`-`)
- You must provide accurate, verifiable contact information. Most registries may request proof of identity
- You must provide a valid email address that you check regularly. If not, your domains may be frozen or deleted

## Requirements for .fr extensions

To register a `.fr` domain, you must be a resident of a European Union member state, or one of the following countries:

- Iceland
- Liechtenstein
- Norway
- Switzerland

This eligibility must remain valid for the entire lifetime of your domain. You must also designate an administrative contact who meets the same residency criteria as the domain holder.

## Requirements for .eu extensions

As of August 2, 2021, you must meet **one** of the following criteria to register a `.eu` domain:

- Be a citizen of an EU member state, Iceland, Liechtenstein, or Norway, regardless of your place of residence

- You may renew the domain for additional years at any time **before it expires**

## Requirements for .co extensions

- `.co` domains can be registered for up to 5 years

- You may renew them any time before they expire

## Requirements for .nl extensions

- Registrants outside the Netherlands automatically use the [SIDN registry address](https://www.sidn.nl/en/nl-domain-name/domicile-address) as a domicile address, meaning official documents can be formally delivered there

- Domains can only be registered for 1 year, but you may renew them at any time

## Requirements for .ai extensions

- `.ai` domains must be registered for a minimum of 2 years and a maximum of 10 years

- Renewals and transfers must also be made for at least 2 years
