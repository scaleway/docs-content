Many Cockpit users encounter issues with Grafana data sources not syncing properly, leading to missing data on dashboards. This page shows you how to resolve synchronization problems using the [Cockpit Global API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/cockpit/v1/global-api/).

<Macro id="requirements" />

  - A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - [Created](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) an API key with sufficient [IAM permissions](/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/) to perform the actions described on this page
  - [Installed](https://curl.se/download.html) curl

Open a terminal and run the following command to trigger the synchronization of your data sources:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"project_id":"$SCALEWAY_PROJECT_ID"}' \
    "https://api.scaleway.com/cockpit/v1/grafana/sync-data-sources"

Make sure that you replace `$SCW_SECRET_KEY` with your API secret key and `$SCALEWAY_PROJECT_ID` with the ID of the Scaleway Project affected by the issue.
