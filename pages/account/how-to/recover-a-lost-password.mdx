If you forget or lose the password to your [Scaleway account](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements), there are several methods you can use to regain access.

<Requirements />

- A [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/en/) account

## Log in without a password using an authentication code

The [authentication code](/account/how-to/log-in-to-the-console/#how-to-log-in-with-an-authentication-code) allows you to access your account without a password.

Click **Send authentication code** on the login page of the Scaleway console.

A code is sent to your email. You can enter the code in the console to authenticate yourself and log in.

## Reset your password using email validation

If you forget or lose your password, you can request to reset it.

1. From the [Scaleway console login page](https://account.scaleway.com/), Click **Log in with password**.
1. Click **Forgot your password?**, or access the [lost password](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elementsforgot-password/) page.
2. Enter your email address and click **Reset password**. A password reset link is sent to your email address.
3. Click the link in the email address to reset your password.
4. Enter your new password and click **Reset password** to set the new password for your account. You are redirected to the Login page.
5. Log in to the console with your email address and your new password.

## Recover your password if you lost access to your email account

If you lose access to your email account, you will not be able to reset the password directly from the Scaleway console. Instead, write to our Trust and Safety team with the following information:

- Your current and new email addresses
- The telephone number registered on your account
- If you have an individual account, your passport or local ID card
- If you have a corporate account, the certificate of incorporation and a copy of the last Scaleway invoice you received

Once you have gathered all the required documents, send the request by email to: `document@scaleway.com`.

We will update the email address on receipt of the application, subject to validation.

Once your email address has been updated, you can use the [lost password form](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elementsforgot-password) to receive the recovery codes for your account.

## Password security guidelines

Besides the usual guidelines you should follow to create a complex password (must contain UPPERCASE and lowercase letters, symbols (`@`, `$`, `&`, …) and numbers), some basic rules exist to keep your password and your account safe:

  - Never give your password to anyone. Especially not via email, IRC, Slack, WhatsApp, or any messaging system. Scaleway employees will never ask you for your password.
  - Use [multifactor authentication](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elementsaccount/profile) to add an extra layer of security.
  - Do not write down your password.
  - Always log out of your account at the end of each session, or if you are away from your computer.
