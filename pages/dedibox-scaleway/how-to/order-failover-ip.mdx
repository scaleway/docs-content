<FailoverIp />

Failover IP addresses allow you to assign multiple IPs to the same server. For example, you could use one IP for each website or virtual machine hosted on the server.

Each failover IP can be routed to any of your Dedibox servers at any time in just a few minutes using the Scaleway console or API. By switching failover IP addresses from one server to another, hosted services remain available without reconfiguring the IP address.

Failover IPs can be purchased as single IP addresses (with a defined maximum number of IPs per Dedibox server, depending on your offer) or as /27 IP blocks for Dedibox servers with the Business service level.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Ordered](/dedibox-scaleway/how-to/order-dedibox/) a Dedibox server
