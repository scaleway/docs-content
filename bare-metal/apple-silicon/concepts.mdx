## Apple silicon

Apple silicon is Apple's own design of processor. It is the basis of Mac computers, as well as many other Apple products.

## Apple silicon as-a-service

Scaleway Apple silicon as-a-Service uses [Apple Mac mini](#mac-mini) hardware. These devices rely on the power of Apple's [silicon](#apple-silicon) technology, ensuring exceptional performance and energy efficiency.

Apple silicon as-a-Service is tailored for developing, building, testing, and signing applications for Apple devices such as iPhones, iPads, Mac computers and more. The Mac mini boasts a sophisticated neural engine that significantly enhances machine learning capabilities.

## Mac mini

The Mac mini is a physical hardware designed by Apple, powered by the [Apple silicon](#apple-silicon) chip. It is the basis for Scaleway's [Apple silicon as-a-service](#apple-silicon-as-a-service) offer.

## VNC

Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a remote desktop-sharing protocol. It allows you to visualize the graphical screen output of a remote computer and transfer local keyboard and mouse events to the remote computer using a network connection. The protocol is platform-independent, which means that various clients exist for Linux, Windows, and macOS-based computers. The VNC server used on the Mac mini is directly integrated with the macOS system without any restrictions from our side.
