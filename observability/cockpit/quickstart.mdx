Scaleway's Observability Cockpit allows you to monitor your applications and their infrastructure by giving you insights and context into their behavior. With Cockpit, you can visualize your resources' and applications' metrics, logs, and traces in Grafana dashboards. Cockpit is automatically activated when you are using [Scaleway resources that are integrated into it](/observability/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-limitations/#product-integration-into-cockpit).

The Observability Cockpit provides you with [endpoints](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#endpoints) to push [metrics](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#metric), [logs](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#logs), and [traces](/observability/cockpit/concepts/#traces).

Learn [how to reduce extra costs and understand Cockpit pricing](/observability/cockpit/reference-content/understanding-cockpit-usage/).

In this documentation, we show you how to retrieve your Grafana credentials to access your Grafana, and how to create a push token to send metrics and logs to your Cockpit. We include tips to go further at the end of this Quickstart, to show you how you can configure the Grafana Alloy agent to push your metrics, logs, and traces to Cockpit and visualize your data in Grafana.

<Macro id="requirements" />

  - A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

<Message type="important">
 - Having the default configuration on your agents might lead to more of your resources' metrics being sent, a high consumption, and a high bill at the end of the month.
 - Sending metrics and logs for Scaleway resources or personal data using an external path is a billable feature. In addition, any data that you push yourself is billed, even if you send data from Scaleway products. Refer to the [product pricing](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/?tags=available,managedservices-observability-cockpit) for more information.

  If you have not set up an agent yet, check out our [documentation](/observability/cockpit/how-to/send-metrics-with-grafana-alloy/) to find out how to configure Grafana Alloy, push your metrics, and visualize them in Grafana.
  You must have created resources to monitor to push your data to Cockpit.
