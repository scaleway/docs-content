Once you have a Dedibox server, installed an OS and connected to it via SSH, you are ready to start using it. This document gives you some basic information and tips for using your Dedibox server.

<Message type="requirement">

## How to use the shell

By default, there is no graphical desktop available on a server. Instead, you run all commands in text mode in a powerful shell/terminal. It allows you to carry out several actions, including installing, configuring and using software, creating, editing and deleting files and folders, and configuring your machine. You can [connect to the shell via SSH](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/connect-to-server/#how-to-connect-via-ssh).

The most basic commands required for using your server via the shell can be found in our [basic Linux commands](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/reference-content/basic-linux-commands/) tutorial.

## How to use a graphical desktop

If you prefer a graphical desktop on your Dedibox, you can install one of our Desktop orientated distributions and connect to the server using the X2Go Client. Refer to our documentation to [connect via Windows Remote Desktop](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/connect-to-server/#how-to-connect-via-remote-desktop).

## How to install software (Linux OSes)

After you create and install your Dedibox, only an SSH server and an operating system are installed on the server. A package manager will help you install and manage software on your server. There are many package managers available, depending on your distribution.

  - On Debian/Ubuntu, the package manager is called APT. See our documentation on [getting started with the APT package manager](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/manage-packages/).
  - On CentOS/RedHat, the package manager is called YUM.
  - On SuSE Linux, the package manager is called YAST.

You can use package managers to install, update and delete software directly from the shell.

## How to back up your Dedibox 

You are responsible for the data on your server. Therefore, we recommend making regular backups. Each Dedibox can order a Dedibackup option, with different disk sizes. Dedibackup gives you secure FTP storage where you can keep your backups. You can also automatize your backups, with tools like Backup Manager.
