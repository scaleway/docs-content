## Can you create a Web Hosting if you do not have a domain yet?

Yes. During the Web Hosting creation process, you are prompted to enter a domain that will be linked to your Web Hosting. This domain will serve as your website's entry point.
You can create your Web Hosting even if you have not registered any domain yet, by selecting **External domain or register later**.

<Message type="important">
  However, once you have created your Web Hosting, remember to **register your domain** either at Scaleway or another provider, and **update your domain's DNS records to use Scaleway's configuration** to connect your domain to Web Hosting.
  Find out how to register a Scaleway domain in the [dedicated documentation](/domains-and-dns/how-to/register-internal-domain/).

## What is the difference between cPanel and WordPress admin?

When creating your Web Hosting, you can choose to manage your website through two different management interfaces: cPanel or WordPress.

**cPanel** is a control panel that gives you access to technical tools to manage your hosting environment, such as:
 - Setting up email accounts
 - Managing files
 - Creating databases
 - Installing software, or
 - Uploading a custom-coded website.

 You can control your websiteâ€™s structure and appearance by uploading or editing HTML, CSS, or PHP files directly.

**WordPress** is a user-friendly dashboard for WordPress websites that helps you create and manage your website. With WordPress, you can:
 - Customize themes
 - Add content, and
 - Install plugins

 You can define how your website looks and behaves without needing to code.
