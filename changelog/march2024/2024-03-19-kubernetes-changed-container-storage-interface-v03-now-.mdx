New Kubernetes Kapsule clusters now natively incorporate the 0.3 release of Scaleway's Container Storage Interface, granting users access to the latest [Block Storage Low Latency](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/storage/block/) via its StorageClasses: `sbs-default`, `sbs-5k`, or `sbs-15k` where applicable.

Visit our [Get Started with Kubernetes Storage](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/tutorials/get-started-kubernetes-storage/) tutorial for more information.

*Migrations from CSI v0.2 to CSI v0.3 are not yet supported*.
*Using tag `no-scw-csi-v0.3` at cluster creation, new clusters can keep using the CSI version 0.2 and its legacy StorageClass `scw-sbs`*
