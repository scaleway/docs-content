## What is Transactional Email?

Scaleway's Transactional Email service is a fully managed solution dedicated to sending transactional emails. With Transactional Email, you can send your emails via the API or SMTP, add and verify a sending domain, configure SPF and DKIM authentication, and monitor emails via the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/).

## What are transactional emails?

A transactional email is a type of automated, non-promotional email triggered by interactions with a website or an application, e.g. account creation, password modification, new order, payment status, etc. Unlike marketing emails, transactional emails are usually expected by customers and thus, have a much higher open rate than marketing emails.

## Can I use your platform to send my marketing emails?

Scaleway's Transactional Email platform is dedicated to sending transactional emails only. You cannot use Transactional Email to send marketing emails. [Read our anti-spam policy](https://tem.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/antispam_policy.pdf) for more information.

## How can I configure DNS records to send emails?

You need to [add SPF and DKIM records](/transactional-email/how-to/add-spf-dkim-records-to-your-domain/) to be able to send emails. Find out [how to set up your DNS records for other DNS providers](/tutorials/set-up-spf-dkim-for-dns-providers/).

## How do I know if my domain is valid for sending emails?

After configuring your SPF and DKIM records, you must launch a verification of the domain either via [the console](https://console.scaleway.com/transactional-email/domains) in the **DNS verification** tab, or the [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/transactional-email/#path-domains-display-spf-and-dkim-records-status-and-potential-errors). You will then receive an email informing you whether your domain was validated or if there are errors to fix so it can be validated.

## Do I have to set up an MX record for better email deliverability?

Setting up an [MX record](/transactional-email/concepts#mx-record) is highly recommended to ensure your email deliverability. Find out [how to add an MX record to your domain](/transactional-email/how-to/add-mx-record-to-your-domain/#how-to-add-your-own-mx-record). You can also [use Scaleway's blackhole MX](/transactional-email/how-to/add-mx-record-to-your-domain/#how-to-add-scaleways-mx-record) if you do not have your own MX.

## What happens to automatically configured DNS records when I delete a domain in the Transactional Email service?

When a domain is removed from Scalway's Transactional Email platform, [autoconfigured DNS records](/transactional-email/how-to/autoconfigure-domain/) are not automatically deleted in the Domains & DNS section. You must manually delete or modify these records if you no longer use the domain to send emails. Verifying the associated DNS records is recommended to ensure they are correctly configured or removed.

## What is the impact on the Transactional Email service if a DNS zone is deleted in Scaleway Domains & DNS?

If a DNS zone is deleted while [autoconfig is enabled](/transactional-email/how-to/autoconfigure-domain/), the DNS records will be added to the parent zone. This ensures that the domain remains validated on the Transactional Email platform, allowing continued service use without interruption.

## What are the limitations and restrictions when using Transactional Email?

Find out about [limits and quotas](/transactional-email/reference-content/tem-capabilities-and-limits/) available for Transactional Email. If you want to increase your quota beyond the values shown on this page, [contact our Support team](https://console.scaleway.com/support/create).

## How is Scaleway's Transactional Email service billed?

At the end of the month, you are billed for the number of emails you sent.
If the number of emails you have sent exceeds the number of emails included in your offer, you will be billed for the excess emails. For example, if you use the free tier of 300 emails per month, and you end up sending 305 emails, you will only be billed for five emails out of the 305 you have sent.
Check out our [dedicated page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/?tags=managedservices-transactionalemail-transactionalemail) for more information about Transactional Email's pricing.

## Can I unblock an address that was automatically added to a TEM blocklist before the blockage period ends?
Yes, you can manually unblock any address, even if it is still under the temporary block period. You can unblock up to five addresses every 24 hours.

## What happens if an address on a TEM blocklist becomes valid again?
You can manually unblock the address. Before doing so, ensure that the initial cause of the bounce has been resolved to prevent further issues.

## Can I remove addresses from the blocklist?
Yes, all blocked addresses can be unblocked via the interface. If you manually added an address, you have full control over when and if it is removed from the blocklist.

## What are the main benefits of the Scale plan?
The Scale plan provides advanced control over email deliverability through a dedicated IP, detailed performance tracking, and advanced webhook management. It is ideal for businesses with high email-sending volume requirements.

## What is the difference between a dedicated IP and a shared IP?
A dedicated IP is used exclusively by a single user, allowing for better control over sending reputation. A shared IP is shared among multiple users, which can impact deliverability based on the practices of other senders.

## What happens if my dedicated IP is blacklisted?
TEM can assist in identifying the problem and recommending corrective actions, but the final resolution depends on your sending practices. Therefore, it is essential to follow [best practices for deliverability](/transactional-email/reference-content/understanding-tem-reputation-score/#best-practices-for-domain-reputation-and-deliverability) to avoid this type of situation.

## Can I use both a dedicated IP and a shared IP on the same project?
No, a project using a dedicated IP cannot send emails via a shared IP. If you want to use a shared IP, you must create a separate project.

Refer to the [Understanding managed dedicated IPs](/transactional-email/reference-content/tem-dedicated-ip) documentation page for more information.

## Does a dedicated IP include both IPv4 and IPv6?
Yes, each dedicated IP provided with the Scale plan includes both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address. This ensures better compatibility with different email providers and optimizes the deliverability of sent emails.

Refer to the [Understanding managed dedicated IPs](/transactional-email/reference-content/tem-dedicated-ip) documentation page for more information.

## Can I add a new dedicated IP to my Organization?
If you want to add a new dedicated IP to your Organization, you must create a new Scaleway Project with the Scale plan or contact support to review your request.

Refer to the [Understanding managed dedicated IPs](/transactional-email/reference-content/tem-dedicated-ip) documentation page for more information.

## Does Scaleway have an anti-spam policy?
Yes. You can find Scaleway's official Transactional Email anti-spam policy in the [contracts](https://www.scaleway.com/en/contracts/) section of the Scaleway website.

## Can I authorize sending emails from specific IP addresses?

Yes. You can authorize sending emails from a specific IP address by [configuring conditions in IAM policies](/iam/reference-content/understanding-policy-conditions/).

You can add a condition like the following to allow an IP address:

```
request_ip == "198.51.100.0"
```

## Has Scaleway conducted a Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA) under Clause 14 of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (Art. 46(2)(c) GDPR) for Transactional Email?
For our Transactional Email service, no personal data is transferred outside the EU, so a TIA was not required. All data is hosted and processed entirely within the European Union.

## Does Scaleway engage any non-EU sub-processors for the processing of Transactional Emails?
No. The entire Transactional Email (TEM) technical stack is fully managed by Scaleway, within the EU. Across all our services we maintain a default policy of no data transfers outside the EU. In rare, exceptional cases, we may work with U.S. or Canadian partners. Such transfers are always governed by recognized adequacy mechanisms (e.g. the EU–U.S. Data Privacy Framework) and by our Standard Contractual Clauses as set out in Article 11 of our Data Processing Agreement.
