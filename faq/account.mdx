## My account is locked. What do I do?

If your account is locked, [contact our support team](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create) to learn the reason for the blockage and discover how to regain access.

## Can I change my Organization’s country?

If you need to change your Organization country and region, you must [create a support ticket](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create).

To make the process faster, when creating your ticket, inform us of your Organization’s new address, including: street address, city, postal code, region, and country.

## Can I move a Project to another account?

At this moment, it is not possible to move a Project from one account to another.

## How do I delete my Organization?

[Closing your account](/console/account/how-to/close-account/#how-to-close-your-account) permanently deletes your Organization, along with its servers, resources, services, and backups.

<Message type="note">
  We recommend that you delete all resources before closing your account. Otherwise, the remaining resources will be billed for usage before their manual deletion, which can take up to 10 days.
</Message>

## Can I reopen a closed account?

Yes, you can [reopen a closed account](/console/account/how-to/close-account/#how-to-reopen-your-account). However, a closed account's resources are permanently deleted, and you cannot retrieve them.

2. Under the section **User information**, click **Edit profile**.
3. Enter a new address under **Email address**, then click **Confirm changes** to save your modification.

## How can I get more quotas?

You can get more quotas by adding and verifying your [payment method](/console/billing/how-to/add-payment-method/) and [identity](/console/account/how-to/verify-identity/).

If you have already completed these two steps and still need an increase in quotas, contact our [support team](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets/create) and inform them which product you need more quotas for.

## I don’t seem to have access to my Organization's resources

If you do not have access to certain Organization resources, you might not have the necessary [IAM](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#iam) **permission set**.

[Read the documentation on permission sets](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/)​ to learn more about the different access levels.

Contact an Organization owner or a member with the necessary permissions to request rights to the resources you require access to.

## I would like to delete my Scaleway account and data

Refer to the [How to delete your account and personal data](/console/account/how-to/close-account/#how-to-delete-your-account-and-personal-data) documentation.

<Message type="note">
  Once you request the deletion of your account and personal data, you will no longer be able to access your account or invoices. The request will take at least 72 hours to be processed. You must make sure all your bills are paid, and that you have not used any resources since the beginning of the current calendar month.
</Message>

## I have created a resource in the wrong Project. Can I move it?

At this moment, it is not possible to move a resource from one Project to another.

If you need to move a resource, you must delete it and create it again in the right Project.

## Where can I find my Organization ID?

You can find your Organization ID by accessing the [Settings](https://console.scaleway.com/organization/settings) page of your Organization dashboard.

In the first section, **Organization Information**, you will find the ID and a shortcut to copy it, if necessary.

## I've been invited to an Organization, but can’t see any resources

When you create a Scaleway account after being invited to join a specific Organization, a personal Organization is automatically created for you.

If you only want to work on the Project you have been invited to, you can switch Organizations and Projects using the drop-down menu on the console dashboard.
