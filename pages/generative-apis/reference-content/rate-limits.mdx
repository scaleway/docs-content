## What are the limits?

Any model served through Scaleway Generative APIs gets limited based on:
- Tokens per minute
- Queries per minute

Base limits apply if you registered a valid payment method, and these limits correspond to [quotas for your Organization](/organizations-and-projects/additional-content/organization-quotas/). Limits are increased automatically if you also [verify your identity](/account/how-to/verify-identity/). 

<Message type="tip">
If you created a Scaleway Account but did not register a valid payment method, stricter limits apply to ensure usage stays within Free Tier only.
</Message>

## How can I increase the rate limits?

We actively monitor usage and will improve rates based on feedback.
If you need to increase your rate limits:
- [Verify your identity](/account/how-to/verify-identity/) to automatically increase your rate limit as described below
- [Contact our support team](https://console.scaleway.com/support/create), providing details on the model used and specific use case, for additional increase.
Note that for increases of up to x5 or x10 volumes, we highly recommend using dedicated deployments with [Managed Inference](https://console.scaleway.com/inference/deployments), which provides exactly the same features and API compatibility.

## Why do we set rate limits?

These limits safeguard against abuse or misuse of Scaleway Generative APIs, helping to ensure fair access to the API with consistent performance.
