Each container comes with an automatically generated domain, on which it is available. However, it is possible to use your own domain name to address your containers to facilitate their use.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A running [Serverless Container](/serverless/containers/how-to/deploy-a-container-from-scaleway-container-registry/)
- Registered a domain name with the provider of your choice and have access to the domain name's DNS zone file

    If you are using **Cloudflare DNS**, see the note below regarding proxying.

1. On your domain provider's platform (for example, [Scaleway's domains](/network/domains-and-dns/how-to/manage-dns-records/)), add a CNAME record pointing to your container default URL in the domain's DNS zone file.

    <Message type="note">
      - All domains are supported.
      - CNAME flattening is supported. [CNAME flattening](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cname-flattening-rfc-compliant-cnames-at-a-domains-root/) speeds up CNAME resolution and allows you to use a CNAME record at your root/apex domain.
      - If your DNS provider does not support CNAME flattening, you need to create an ALIAS on your root domain (named `@` or with an empty name) instead of a CNAME.

2. Click the **Endpoints** tab on your containers' page.
3. Click **+ Add endpoint**.
4. Enter your custom domain name and validate the form.
5. The console runs checks on the CNAME and TLS configuration of the custom domain name. Connect to your container using your custom domain once all checks are complete.

<Message type="important">
  **Custom Domains** do not currently support websockets. If you need to use websockets, you must configure them with the original container URL.
