## Creating a project

You need your API's secret key and your Organization ID for the step below.

Open a terminal and type the following command to create a project. Make sure you replace `$SCW_SECRET_KEY` with your API's secret key and `$ORGANIZATION_ID` with the ID of your Organization.

```
curl -XPOST https://api.scaleway.com/account/v2/projects -H 'X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY' -d '{"organization_id":"$ORGANIZATION_ID","name":"name-of-project"}'
```
An output similar to the following displays:

```
{"id":"1bc9d87e-6543-2f2g-1hi0-1j234k45l6m7","name":"test-project","organization_id":"0a123456-7b8c-9d0e1-f234-5ghi6789j012","created_at":"2022-07-19T15:02:43.455727Z","updated_at":"2022-07-19T15:02:43.455727Z","description":""}%
