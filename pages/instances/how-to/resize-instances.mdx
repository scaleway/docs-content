You can adjust the size of your Scaleway Instances (also known as vertical scaling) to meet changing workload demands and optimize resource usage.
Whether you need to scale up to handle increased traffic, scale down to reduce costs, or simply reconfigure your Instance to better align with your application’s requirements, vertical scaling lets you increase or decrease computational power without the hassle of destroying and recreating Instances.
Scaleway’s flexible infrastructure allows you to modify CPU and RAM allocation, as well as manage your Block Storage volumes directly from the console, ensuring your resources always match your needs.

Alternatively, you can also resize your Instance using the command line by following the guide [Changing the commercial type of an Instance with the API or CLI](/instances/api-cli/migrating-instances/).

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) using Block Storage volumes
