API keys are unique identifiers necessary to use the [Scaleway API](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/). You can generate API keys for yourself or for an [IAM application](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts#application) via the Scaleway console. Each API key is scoped to one [Organization]((/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts#organization)) only (so if you are part of multiple Organizations, you will need a different API key for each one). Each user and application can have multiple API keys in each Organization.

API keys always inherit the permissions of their bearer (the IAM user or IAM application with which they are associated), giving that bearer the exact rights and permissions that have been defined for them in the Organization via [policies](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts#policy).

  You can only generate API keys for yourself, and for IAM applications. You cannot generate API keys for other IAM users, regardless of your permissions.

## How to generate an API key for yourself 

<Message type="important">

  Generating an API key via the legacy Credentials tab of the Project Dashboard, as described [here](/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key/) is still possible, though this page and functionality will be deprecated in the future. In the meantime, creating an API key this way willH result in creation of an API key scoped for full permissions on that Project and associated with an IAM application and not you as a user. See the [IAM migration documentation](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/migration#api-keys/) for more details). You must follow the procedure below to generate an API key associated with yourself as a user.

</Message>

1. Click **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** from the top-right of your [**Organization Dashboard**](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) in the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) displays.

2. Click your name in the list of users. You are taken to your user dashboard.

3. Click the **Credentials** tab. The following screen displays:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-user-credentials.webp" alt="" />

4. Click the <Icon name="plus" /> button to generate a new API key. The following screen pops up:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-generate-api-key.webp" alt="" />

5. Enter an optional description for your API key, and select a preferred Project for Object Storage.

  <Message type="note">

  **Preferred Projects for Object Storage**: When creating and/or listing Object Storage buckets via the API, there is no available parameter to specify the Project in which you wish to list or create buckets. All buckets you create via the API will therefore be created in the preferred Project you choose when creating the API key. Similarly, when listing buckets, buckets from your preferred Project will be listed.
  Note that:
    - This only applies to the creation and/or listing of Object Storage buckets, and no other products or resources.
    - You can still create and/or list buckets in your choice of Project via the Scaleway console.

6. Click **Generate API Key**. A screen displays showing the access key and secret key for your new API key and reminding you that this is your only chance to securely save the secret key:

7. Ensure you have securely saved the secret key, then close the window. You are returned to the **Credentials** tab, where your new API key now appears in the list.

## How to create an API key for an IAM application

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You are the Owner of your Organization, or an IAM user in an Organization where you have the [IAMManager or OrganizationManager](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/manage-users#how-to-view-and-delete-user-api-keys) permission set.

1. Click **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** from the top-right of your [Organization Dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) in the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/applications) displays.

2. Click the **Applications** tab. A list of the Organization's IAM applications displays.

3. Click the name of the application you want to create an API key for. Alternatively, click <Icon name="more" /> next to the application, and select **Overview**. Either way, you are taken to the application's **Overview** tab.

4. Click the **API keys** tab.

5. Click the <Icon name="plus" /> button to generate a new API key. The API key creation wizard displays:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-generate-api-key.webp" alt="" />

6. Complete the information in the wizard as described in step 5 [above](#how-to-generate-an-api-key-for-yourself).

7. Click **Generate API Key**. A screen displays showing the access key and secret key for the new API key and reminding you that this is your only chance to securely save the secret key:
