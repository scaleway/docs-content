## Data Version Control (DVC) - Overview

Git is unarguably the most popular and powerful version control system to store your code, and can handle files of up to 5 GB thanks to Git LFS.

However, when it comes to large datasets, you might need to turn to third-party version control tools that are specifically designed to handle them. 

Data Version Control (DVC) was specifically designed with this use case in mind. It works alongside Git and allows you to store your data in the remote storage of your choice (such as a Scaleway S3-enabled bucket) while storing only the metadata in a Git repository.

In this tutorial, you learn how to use [Scaleway Object Storage](https://www.scaleway.com/en/object-storage/) as a remote storage for DVC.

</Message> 

## Setting up DVC

1. Run the following command to install the DVC Python package:
    ```bash
    pip3 install dvc
    ```

2. Run the following command to install the S3 dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip3 install "dvc[s3]"
    ```

3. Run the following command in the desired repository to initialize DVC:
    ```bash
    dvc init
    ```

4. Run the following command to commit the initial DVC configuration files:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initialize DVC"
    ```

## Retrieving and tracking data

1. Run the following command to copy the example data file to your repository:
    ```bash
    dvc get https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry \
    get-started/data.xml -o data/data.xml
    ```

2. Run the following command to stage files you want to store in your bucket:
    ```bash
    dvc add data/data.xml
    ```

3. Run the following command to track the DVC metadata file and `.gitignore` file with git:
    ```bash
    git add data/data.xml.dvc data/.gitignore
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      The `.gitignore` file contains paths to the data files so they are not tracked by Git.
    </Message>

4. Run the following command to commit the metadata file:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add raw data"
    ```

5. Run the following command to push your changes to your Git repository:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```
  
## Pushing data to Scaleway Object Storage

1. Run the following command to add your bucket as a remote storage for your data:
   ```bash
   dvc remote add -d  myremote s3://my-bucket/path
   ```

2. Run the following command to set the S3 endpoint of your remote storage:
    ```bash
    dvc remote modify myremote \
    endpointurl https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      Edit the `endpointurl` according to the geographical region of your bucket. It can either be `fr-par` (Paris, France), `nl-ams` (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) or `pl-waw` (Warsaw, Poland).
    </Message>

3. Run the following command to push your data to your bucket:
    ```bash
    dvc push
    ```

4. Run the following command to list the content of your bucket:
    ```bash
    aws s3api list-objects-v2 --bucket my-bucket
    ```

    The content of the bucket is displayed:

    ```json
    {
      "Contents": [
          {
              "Key": "22/a1a2931c8370d3aeedd7183606fd7f",
              "LastModified": "2023-05-30T14:49:26.000Z",
              "ETag": "\"22a1a2931c8370d3aeedd7183606fd7f\"",
              "Size": 14445097,
              "StorageClass": "STANDARD"
          }
      ]
    }
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      File names are generated automatically based on the content of the `.dvc` metadata files created upon tracking the data.
