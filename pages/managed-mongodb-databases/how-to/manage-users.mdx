Users can connect to a database and access its data.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)

## How to change the password of your user

2. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
3. Go to the **Users** tab. Your default user displays.
4. Click **Change password** to do so. A pop-up appears.

## How to create a multi-users via the API

When you create your MongoDB® Database Instance, the first user is created by default and has admin rights.

You can create more users and grant them pre-set roles via the [Scaleway Managed MongoDB® API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/managed-database-mongodb/).

<Message type="important">
  All users you create have at first administrator roles, which can be changed after creation with the [Update a user on a Database Instance](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/managed-database-mongodb/#path-users-update-a-user-on-a-database-instance) call.
