The [protected hosting](/webhosting/concepts/#protected-hosting) feature is designed to prevent any accidental or unauthorized deletions of your Web Hosting plan. When enabled, this feature ensures that your Web Hosting plan cannot be deleted, providing an extra layer of protection against unintended disruptions. This is particularly useful for preventing errors, such as accidental cancellations during routine maintenance or management activities.

- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions within the intended Organization
- An active [Web Hosting plan](/webhosting/how-to/order-webhosting/)


1. Click **Web Hosting** in the **Domains & Web Hosting** section of the side menu. The [Web Hosting dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/webhosting) displays.

3. Scroll down to the **Hosting Information** section and click **Enable** next to **Protection** to activate the protected hosting feature.
   A pop-up displays, asking you to confirm the action.
