VPC allows you to build your own **V**irtual **P**rivate **C**loud on top of Scaleway's shared public cloud. Within each VPC, you can create multiple **Private Networks** and attach Scaleway resources to them, as long as the resources are in an AZ within the network's region. Attached resources can then communicate between themselves in an isolated and secure layer 2 network, away from the public Internet.

Private Networks also have built-in **D**ynamic **H**ost **C**onfiguration **P**rotocol (DHCP), making it easy to manage the private IP addresses of your resources on the network.

<Message type="note">
Previously, Private Networks at Scaleway were zoned. Only resources from within one defined AZ could be attached to each network. Now, all Private Networks are regional, and resources from any AZ within that network's region can be attached. "Old" zoned Private Networks have all been automatically migrated to become regional.

While DHCP is built into all new Private Networks, it may not be automatically activated for older Private Networks. Check our [migration](TODO) documentation for more information.

## How to create a Private Network

1. Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the side menu.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-vpc.webp" alt="" />
    TODO: check screenshot

    Each Private Network must be created within a VPC. 

2. Click the VPC you wish to create your Private Network in.

    If you already have existing Private Networks in this VPC, a list of these displays. Otherwise, you see a welcome screen.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-reg-pn.webp" alt="" />
    TODO: check screenshot

    TODO check which screen you are directed to here: the Overview or the list of private networks? Might need an extra step

3. Click **+ Create Private Network**. The creation screen displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-rpn.webp" alt=""/>
    TODO: check screenshot.

4. Enter a **name** for the network, or leave the randomly-generated name in place. Optionally, you can also add **tags** to help organize your Private Networks. Each tag should be separated by a space.

5. **Optional**: Click **Advanced Settings** to edit these settings, otherwise they will be left at default recommended values. The only advanced setting available concerns the creation of an IPv4 CIDR block for the Pirvate Network, from which private IP addresses will be allocated. You cannot change the CIDR block after the Private Network has been created. See the section below on [configuring CIDR](#how-to-configure-cidr) for more help with choosing these settings.

6. Click **Create Private Network** to finish. Your Private Network is created. You are taken back to the **Private Networks** dashboard of your VPC [TODO CHECK not overview page], where your new Private Network is now displayed in the list.

## How to configure CIDR

Private Networks have built-in **D**ynamic **H**ost **C**onfiguration **P**rotocol (DHCP). DHCP manages the automatic allocation of private IP addresses to resources attached to the network. For this purpose, a **C**lassless **I**nter-**D**omain **R**outing (CIDR) block is defined for each Private Network, from which IP addresses will be assigned. In fact, both an IPv4 and an IPv6 CIDR block are defined.

### IPv6 CIDR block

The IPv6 CIDR block is defined automatically and "invisibly" by default at the time of creating the Private Network. It cannot be modified either at the time of creation, or afterwards.

It is a `/64` block, guaranteed to be unique within the VPC and not overlapping with any of your other Private Networks.

### IPv4 CIDR block

The IPv4 CIDR block is defined at the time of creating the Private Network. You can choose to automatically generate a default IPv4 CIDR block, or define a custom block. However, in either case, the IPv4 CIDR block cannot be modified after creation.

#### Automatically generating a CIDR block

Automatically generating a CIDR block is the default (and recommended) setting when creating a Private Network. Simply follow the steps [above](#how-to-create-a-private-network) to create a Private Network, leave **Advanced Settings** at default values, and a `/22` CIDR block will be automatically generated for the Private Network. 

This block is guaranteed to be unique within the VPC, and will not overlap with any of your other Private Networks. It gives 1024 private IPv4 addresses, of which 1022 are available to be allocated to resources attached to the Private Network.

#### Defining a custom CIDR block

If you prefer, you can define your own custom IPv4 CIDR block when creating your Private Network. This is only recommended for advanced users.

1. Follow the steps [above](TODO) to create a Private Network, and at step 5 click **Advanced Settings**. 

2. Click **Define custom**. The following screen displays:

    TODO: insert screenshot

3. Enter a network **prefix**. This should typically be in the following ranges normally used for private networks:
    - `192.168.0.0` - `192.168.255.255`
    - `172.16.0.0` - `172.31.255.255`
    - `10.0. 0.0` - `10.255. 255.255`

4. Choose your **network size** from the options available. The range of options begins at `/20`, with 2094 addresses available for resources on the Private Network, and ends at `/28`, with 14 addresses available for resources on the Private Network.

    <Message type="note">
    The CIDR block that you define must constitute a range that does not overlap with any of Private Network in this VPC. The blocks assigned to other Private Networks in the VPC are displayed for you, to help you with your configuration.

5. Click **Create Private Network** to finish.
