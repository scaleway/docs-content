This page explains how to upload your functions and their dependencies as a ZIP file using the Scaleway console.
This feature can help you to add your libraries or static files to your function.

<Macro id="requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created a functions namespace](/serverless/functions/how-to/create-a-functions-namespace/)
  - You know how to [create a Function](/serverless/functions/how-to/create-a-function/)
</Message>

There are [different methods to deploy functions](/serverless/functions/reference-content/deploy-function/) and some of them require
the function to be packaged into a `zip` file.

## How to package a function into zip file

To match the Scaleway build pipelines requirements, functions zip files must contain the content of the root folder you want to publish.

✅ Example of a good archive:
``` 
myFunc.zip contains:
└── handler.js
```

❌ Example of a bad archive:
```
myFunc.zip contains:
└── myFunc/ (a folder)
    └── handler.js
```

To create an archive of folder content, you can use the `zip` command:

```sh
zip -r handler.zip handler/
```

To check if your archive is well-formed, ensure you have your function code as soon as you `unzip` it.


## How to upload your zip file to the Scaleway console

1. Package your dependencies on your local computer, as explained in the [Configure your package](/serverless/functions/how-to/package-function-dependencies-in-zip/#how-to-zip-your-function) section.
2. Create a **ZIP** archive containing the files and folders you need.
3. Go to the [Functions](https://console.scaleway.com/functions/namespaces) section of the Scaleway console and click on the function namespace you want to configure.
4. Click **+ Create function**. The function creation page displays.
5. On the function creation page, choose your desired runtime.
6. Select **Upload a ZIP** in **Function code**.
7. Drag and drop your ZIP file in the reserved field or upload it.
8. Specify your **handler** path.
9. Configure your function.
10. Click **Create function** to finish.


## How to upload your zip file using the Scaleway API


<Message type="note">
  These steps only apply if you use a [Scaleway runtime](/serverless/functions/reference-content/functions-runtimes-configuration/). 
</Message>

In this section, you will upload your code to a S3 bucket, which we will package and build into a container image. The created container image will then be available in a registry namespace associated to your functions namespace.

1. Set an environment variable to name the ZIP file automatically.
    ```bash
    export FUNCTION_ARCHIVE="function-$SCW_FUNCTION_ID.zip"
    ```

2. Create a zip archive with your code:
    ```bash
    zip $FUNCTION_ARCHIVE handler.js
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      If you wish to use external dependencies, you will have to package them inside the zip archive as well:

        ```bash
        zip -r $FUNCTION_ARCHIVE package.json handler.js node_modules
        ```
    </Message>

3. Get the size of your archive in bytes, to ask for a presigned URL to upload your source code:
    ```bash
    ls -lh
    -rw-r--r--  1 user  group   675 Apr 18 15:42 $FUNCTION_ARCHIVE

    export ARCHIVE_SIZE=675
    ```

4. Get the presigned URL from the API.
    ```bash
    curl -X GET -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_ACCESS_KEY" "https://api.scaleway.com/functions/v1beta1/regions/$SCW_DEFAULT_REGION/functions/$SCW_FUNCTION_ID/upload-url?content_length=$ARCHIVE_SIZE"

    ## Example of response from our API
    {"url":"https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/scw-database-srvless-prod/uploads/function-b0525a73-947d-4ba4-92de-17f267a7ec5a.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=SCW6Z6VKJVG81FQZVB14%2F20190627%2Ffr-par%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20190627T092839Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=content-length%3Bcontent-type%3Bhost\u0026X-Amz-Signature=e9f3e22f39638dac047f0f4e9ab521c7971cacb01f61f523cb948baa328a0eff","headers":{"content-length":["347"],"content-type":["application/octet-stream"]}}
    ```

    <Message type="important">
      As you can see, the URL is not properly formatted (`\u0026…`). To use it properly to upload your code, you must copy the full URL with quotes (otherwise your terminal might add unwanted `\uaa` in the URL string):

        ```bash
        export FUNCTION_ARCHIVE_URL=$(echo -n "<your-url>")
        ```
    </Message>

    <Message type="note">
    If you do not copy the URL with wrapping quotes and save a variable inside using `echo -n` to replace `\u0026` expressions, you will get an error in the following step.
    </Message>

    If you use Postman, you can usually export the presigned URL as it is, as long as you also copy/paste the quotes.

5. Run the following code to upload your code to the presigned URL:
    ```bash
    curl -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" --upload-file $FUNCTION_ARCHIVE -H "Content-Length: $ARCHIVE_SIZE" $FUNCTION_ARCHIVE_URL
    ```

## How to configure your package using Python

### Python handler

The Handler name is a path to the handler file, suffixed with the function name to use as a handler. In the following example, we use one handler, `hello.py`, inside the `src/handlers` folder.

```bash
.
└── handlers
    └── hello.py → def say_hello(event, context): ...
```

1. Package your function. On Unix systems, you can use the `zip` utility:

    ```console
    zip -r functions.zip handlers/
    ```

2. Upload the archive in the console.
3. Provide a custom handler name. In this case, the handler is `say_hello`.
    <Message type="note">
      By default, the handler path is `handler.handle` (def handle in handler.py).
    </Message>

### Python additional dependencies

Additional dependencies must be included inside a `package` directory at the root of your archive.

Your directory structure should look like this:

```bash
.
├── handlers
│   ├── handler.py
│   └── second_handler.py
└── package → Your vendored Python dependencies
    └── requests
```

To package your functions into an archive that can be uploaded to the console, you can use the `zip` utility:

```console
zip -r functions.zip handlers/ package/
```

### Python standard dependencies

In addition, you can install your dependencies in the package directory. To do so, run the following command:

```bash
pip install requests --target ./package
```

Or with a `requirements.txt` file:

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --target ./package
```

### Specific libraries (with needs for specific C compiled code)

In some specific cases, you might need to install libraries that require specific `C` compiled code such as:

- numpy
- tensorflow
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- psycopg2
and others.

Our Python runtimes run on top of [Alpine linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) environments, for these specific dependencies, you will have to install your dependencies inside a **Docker container**, with a specific image, that we are providing to our users.
Run the following command from the root of your project to install your dependencies before uploading your source code and deploying your function:

```bash
PYTHON_VERSION=3.10 # or 3.7, 3.8, ...
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home/app/function --workdir /home/app/function rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/scwfunctionsruntimes-public/python-dep:$PYTHON_VERSION pip install -r requirements.txt --target ./package
```

This command will run `pip install` with the given `requirements.txt` file inside a docker container compatible with our function runtimes, and pull the installed dependencies locally to your package directory. As these dependencies have been installed on top of alpine Linux with our compatible system libraries, you will be able to upload your source code and deploy your function properly.

## How to configure your package using Node

### Node handler

The Handler name is a path to the handler file, suffixed with the function name to use as a handler. In the following example, we use two handlers, `hello.js` and `world.js`, inside the `handlers` folder.

```bash
.
└── handlers
    └── hello.js → export {sayHello}; function sayHello(...) {} 
```

1. Package your function. On Unix systems, you can use the `zip` utility:

    ```console
    zip -r functions.zip handlers/
    ```

2. Upload the archive in the console.
3. Provide a custom handler name. In this case, the handler is `sayHello`.

### Node additional dependencies

If you need to push external dependencies for your `node.js` functions, you must package your `node_modules` directory into your deployment archive. To do so, launch the following command:

```bash
.
├── handler.js
└── node_modules
    └── your_dependencies
```

You can use tools such as [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [NCC](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vercel/ncc) a CLI tool to build `node.js executables`, which packages your code into separate files. Then, you will be able to upload your compiled handler file reducing the size of your bundle.
  For example:
  ```ncc handler.js -o build/handler.js # -> Builds dist/inde```.

Then, set up your function handler to be: `build/handler.js` if you package the whole build directory. Do not forget to point the function handler property to the path of your built handler in your archive (if `build/handler.myHandler`, then `handler` must be `build/handler.js`).

## How to configure your package using Golang

### Golang handler

With **Golang** functions, the handler name should be the name of your exported handler function if your handler is at the root of your folder.
If your handler is in a subdirectory, the handler name should be prefixed by the directory followed by the exported function name.

```bash
.
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
└── handler.go → package handler with func Handle()

```

1. Package your function. On Unix systems, you can use the `zip` utility:

    ```console
    zip -r functions.zip go.mod go.sum handler.go
    ```

2. Upload the archive in the console.
3. Provide a custom handler name. Each of your function will know which handler file to run:
    - For the file `handler.go` at the root of the project → `Handle`.

  <Message type="note">
    By default, the `handler path` is `Handle` (package main at the root of the archive).
  </Message>

### Golang additional dependencies

If you need **external dependencies** for your Golang handlers, you can provide these dependencies using Go Modules.
Our runtimes automatically install your dependencies at **Build time** (once you start the function deployment).

<Message type="note">
  Dependencies installation at the build-time results in longer builds.
</Message>

```bash
.
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
└── handler.go
```

Package your dependencies with the command `go mod vendor`, and provide your generated vendor directory to the function archive. This approach will save you some time during builds:

```bash
.
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
├── main.go
└── vendor
    └── your-dependencies
```

## How to configure your package using PHP

### PHP handler

The Handler name is a path to the handler file, suffixed with the function name to use as a handler. In the following example, we use the handler file `handler.php`.

```bash
.
├── composer.json → optional
└── handler.php → handler function defined here
```

The `composer.json` file enables you to define dependencies that will be installed when deploying your functions, for more information, you can check the [official documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md/#package-links) of composer.

1. Package your functions. On Unix systems, you can use the `zip` utility:

    ```console
    zip -r function.zip composer.json handler.php
    ```

2. Upload the archive in the console.
3. Make sure to provide the right handler name, with the previous directory structure: `handler.handle`.

## How to configure your package using Rust

### Rust handler

The Handler name is a path to the handler file, suffixed with the function name to use as a handler. In the following example, we use the handler file `handler.rs` inside the `src` folder.

``` bash
.
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── handler.rs → pub async fn handle(...)
```

1. Specify the file to be executed in your `Cargo.toml` file:

    ```toml
      [lib]
      path = "src/handler.rs"
    ```

2. Make sure to provide the right handler name, namely `handle`.

### Rust additional dependencies

If you need **external dependencies** for your Rust handlers, you can provide these dependencies in your `Cargo.toml` file.
Our runtimes automatically install your dependencies at **Build time** (once you start the function deployment).

<Message type="note">
  Dependencies installation at the build-time results in longer builds.
</Message>

## How to manage multiple handles in the same zip file

To enhance deployment simplicity, all runtimes support the inclusion of multiple handlers, either within a single file or across multiple files.

Example:

``` bash
.
├── myFuncA.lang (contains handlerA() and handlerB())
└── myFuncB.lang (contains handlerC())
```

Like that, you can create 3 functions with the same zip file by just changing the `handler` parameter
to match the handler you want.
