When you [create a Scaleway account](/account/how-to/create-an-account/), you are the [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) of your Organization. Two types of users can be added to your Organizaton: [Members](/iam/concepts#members) and [Guests](/iam/concepts#guests).

When you invite someone as a Guest they will create their own Scaleway account, if they do not already have one.

You can define the rights and permissions you want Guests to have in your Organization via [policies](/iam/concepts/#policy).

<Lightbox src="scaleway-iam-owners-guests.webp" alt="a diagram shows the relationship between owners and Guests. Alice's Organization contains Alice as an owner and Bob as a Guest. Bob's Organization contains Alice and Charlie as Guests. Alice is an Owner in her Organization and a Guest in Bob's, and vice-versa" />

In the next steps we show you how to invite a Guest.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

1. Click **IAM & API keys** on the top-right drop-down menu of the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-iam-users-dashboard.webp" alt="" />
2. Click **+ Add user**. A pop-up displays prompting you to choose between creating a **Member** or adding a **Guest**.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-guest-or-member.webp" alt="Guest: A Guest is a user that owns their own Organization. They are external to your Organization. This means that their credentials cannot be managed by IAM Managers or Owners. Member: A Member is a user that only exists within an Organization. A Member's permissions and credentials can be managed by IAM Managers and Owners. " />
3. Select **Guest** and click **Continue**.
4. Enter the email address of the person you want to invite. If you want to invite more than one user, enter multiple email addresses separated by commas. Optionally, you can also select a [group](/iam/concepts/#group) to add the user to.
5. Optionally, add one or more tags.

    <Message type="note">
      Tags are key/value pairs that help you organize your users. Keep in mind that:
      - You can assign up to 10 tags per user
      - Tag values must be between 1 and 70 characters long, including `key` and `value`
      - The same tag cannot be used twice
    </Message>
6. Click **Invite** to send the invitation.
    The user receives an email inviting them to accept your invitation. If they do not already have a Scaleway account, they will be prompted to [create one](/account/how-to/create-an-account/) first.
7. The user will appear in the list of your Organization's users once they have accepted the invitation.

<Message type="important">
  Invitations have a validity period of 7 days.
  Once an invitation expires, or if it is rejected, an [IAM log](/iam/how-to/view-logs) is created indicating the user was "deleted".
</Message>
