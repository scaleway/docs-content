This page explains how to manage users in your Data Warehouse for ClickHouse® deployment using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/).

<Message type="note">
During the private beta phase, user management can only be done with the **scwadmin** user via the ClickHouse® CLI, MySQL or HTTPS protocols.
</Message>

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Signed up to the private beta](https://www.scaleway.com/fr/betas/) and received a confirmation email.
- Created a [Data Warehouse deployment](/data-warehouse/how-to/create-deployment/)

## How to manage users using the Scaleway console

During the private beta phase, the management of users for your Data Warehouse for ClickHouse® deployment is limited to:
- Viewing users in your deployment
- Changing the password of an existing user

## How to manage users using frameworks

[Connect to your deployment](/data-warehouse/how-to/connect-applications/) using your preferred framework. 
    <Message type="tip">
    You can also connect using the ClickHouse HTTP console from the **Overview** tab of your deployment. Make sure to enter valid credentials in the top-right fields.
    </Message>

Once connected, you can run SQL queries using `USER`, `ROLE`, and `ROW POLICY` to create new users and grant them the desired permissions via roles.

Refer to the official ClickHouse® documentation on [users and roles](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/statements/create/user) for more information.
