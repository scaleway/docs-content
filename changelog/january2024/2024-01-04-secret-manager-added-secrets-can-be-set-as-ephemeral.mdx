Ephemeral secrets are available on Secret Manager API.

At their creation, Secrets can now be set up with a time-to-live or an expiration after a single access. All secrets versions will inherit from this ephemeral policy.

Refer to the [Secret Manager API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/secret-manager) for more information.
