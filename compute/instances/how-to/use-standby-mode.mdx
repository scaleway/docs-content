[Standby Mode](/compute/instances/concepts#stand-by-mode) temporarily stops an Instance. The Instance remains allocated to your account and all data remains on the local storage of the instance.

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance)

4. Click **Switch to standby mode**. A pop-up displays asking you to confirm the action.

5. Click **Standby** to confirm.

Your Instance is now in Standby mode. 

<Message type="important">

  An Instance in Standby Mode is still considered as allocated to your account. This means you will be billed for the Instance, its storage and any flexible IP attached to it. See also [how to power off your instance](/compute/instances/how-to/power-off-instance/).
