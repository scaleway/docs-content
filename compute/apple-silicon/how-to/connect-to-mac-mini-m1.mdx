## How to connect via VNC

VNC is a remote desktop-sharing protocol. It allows you to visualize the graphical screen output of a remote computer and to transfer local keyboard and mouse events to the remote computer by using a network connection. The protocol is platform-independent which means that various clients exist for Linux, Windows and macOS based computers. The VNC server used on the M1 is the one directly integrated in the macOS system without any restriction from our side.

1. Click **Apple silicon** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. A list of your Mac mini M1s displays.

2. Click the Mac mini M1 you want to connect to. Your Mac mini M1 **Overview** displays.

3. Click the **VNC** button to launch a VNC session on your Mac mini M1.

  Your VNC client opens and you can log in the graphical environment of macOS using the default user m1 and your password.

  <Message type="note">

  macOS may ask you for your password once logged into the VNC session. Change the keyboard layout of macOS to your computerâ€™s local keyboard layout before entering the password. Click on U.S. keyboard in the top right corner, to display a list of all available keyboard layouts

  You are now logged in and can launch applications just as if you were using your Mac mini M1 locally.

The default user to connect to your Mac mini M1 is `m1`. The SSH command to connect is `ssh m1@<your_mac_mini_m1_ip>`.
