Once your [cluster is created](/compute/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster), a `.kubeconfig` file is available for download to manage several Kubernetes clusters. You can use this with kubectl, the Kubernetes command line tool, allowing you to run commands against your Kubernetes clusters. You can use kubectl from a terminal on your local computer to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs. 

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) 
  - You have [created](/compute/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster) a Kubernetes Kapsule cluster

</Message>

1. [Install kubectl](/tutorials/kubeflow-on-kapsule/#installing-kubectl-on-your-local-computer) on your local computer.

2. Download the `.kubeconfig` files from your Cluster's **overview** page:
<Lightbox src="scaleway-kapsule_kubeconfig.webp" alt="" />

3. Configure access to your cluster. You can do this in one of two ways:

  Set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable:
  ```
  export KUBECONFIG=/$HOME/Downloads/Kubeconfig-ClusterName.yaml
  ```

  Or use `use $HOME/.kube/config file`:
  ```
  mv $HOME/Downloads/Kubeconfig-ClusterName.yaml $HOME/.kube/config
  ```

  Either way, make sure you replace `/$HOME/Downloads/Kubeconfig-ClusterName.yaml` with the correct name and path of your downloaded `.kubeconfig` file.

4. Run the following command to finish:

  ```
  kubectl get nodes
  ```
