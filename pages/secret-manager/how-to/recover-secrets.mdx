This page shows you how to recover secrets scheduled for deletion using the Scaleway [console](https://console.scaleway.com). Once you schedule a secret for deletion, it enters a 7-day pending deletion period, during which you can still recover it.
After this retention period, the secret and all its versions are permanently deleted.

<Message type="important">
  Scheduled deletion deletes ephemeral secrets and their versions immediately.
