<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your SSH key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key)
  - You have [created a Production-Optimized Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) with at least 8GB RAM and 25GB Block Storage, running on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
  - You have [installed Ruby 3.2.2](/en/docs/tutorials/ruby-on-rails/) on the instance
  - You have a (sub-)domain pointed to the Instances' IP address
</Message>

1. [Log into your Instance using SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).
2. Update the `apt` package cache and upgrade the software already installed on the Instance to the latest version available in the distribution repositories.
    ```
    apt update && apy upgrade -y
    ```
3. Download the Chatwoot installation script and make it executable:
    ```bsh
    wget https://get.chatwoot.app/linux/install.sh
    chmod +x install.sh
    ```
4. Check the version of Ruby installed on your Instance. Chatwoot requires Ruby 3.2.2.
    ```bsh
    ruby -v
    ruby 3.2.2 (2023-03-30 revision e51014f9c0) [x86_64-linux]
    ```
    <Message type="tip">
      If you are not using Ruby 3.2.2, you have to install it to avoid the installation failing. You can install it, using `rbenv`:
      ```
      rbenv install 3.2.2 #Installs Ruby 3.2.2
      rbenv global 3.2.2 #Configures Ruby 3.2.2 to be used system-wide
      ```
    </Message>
5. Run the Chatwoot installation script:
    ```bsh
    ./install.sh --install
    ````
    * The script asks you if you want to configure Chatwoot with a domain and SSL. Type `yes` and press enter.
    * Type the domain name for Chatwoot (i.e. `chatwoot.domain.com`) and press enter.
    * Type an email address for LetsEncrypt to send reminders when your SSL certificate is up for renewal and press enter.
    * Confirm your choices by typing `yes` and press enter. 
    * Type `yes` to install Postgres and Redis as database engines used by Chatwoot and press enter.
    * The installation script will install the required dependencies, databases and Chatwoot.
    * Once the installation has completed, the following message displays:
        ```
        ***************************************************************************
        Woot! Woot!! Chatwoot server installation is complete.
