HashiCorp [Terraform](http://terraform.io) or [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) (open source fork of Terraform) are open-source software tools to deploy **IaaC**: Infrastructure as Code. It means that you can automate infrastructure resources such as Network, Instances, Elastic Metal servers, and more. It allows you to use declarative configuration files to manage the full lifecycle â€” create new resources, manage existing ones, and delete those no longer needed. The configuration language used by Terraform/OpenTofu is called [Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL)](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl).

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the Scaleway [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- A valid [API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)

## Installing Terraform/OpenTofu

The first step is to install Terraform/OpenTofu on a server or on your computer to deploy and manage your resources. Terraform/OpenTofu is installed on a user environment (which can either be your local computer or a remote server used to manage your infrastructures) to push configuration files to your cloud environment. We suggest adding your configuration files to a versioning system like [GitHub](https://www.github.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) to manage the versioning of your configurations.

### Installation on macOS

Terraform/OpenTofu can be easily installed on computers running macOS X using the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager. Run the following command in a terminal window to install the application:

  ```
  brew tap hashicorp/tap && brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform
  ```

### Installation on Windows

The installation of Terraform/OpenTofu on Windows can be done in a single command line using the [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package manager. Run the following command in a terminal window to install Terraform/OpenTofu on computers running Microsoft Windows:

  ```
  choco install terraform
  ```

### Installation on Linux

The installation of Terraform/OpenTofu on Linux can be done in a few simple steps.

1. Ensure your system is up to date and you have installed the `gnupg`, `software-properties-common`, and `curl` packages.
    ```
    apt update && apt install -y gnupg software-properties-common
    ```
2. Download the HashiCorp GPG key on your machine.
    ```
    wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | \
    gpg --dearmor | \
    sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null
    ```
3. Verify the key's fingerprint.
    ```
    gpg --no-default-keyring \
    --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg \
    --fingerprint
    ```
    The `gpg` command reports the key's fingerprint:
    ```
    /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
    -------------------------------------------------
    pub   rsa4096 XXXX-XX-XX [SC]
    AAAA AAAA AAAA AAAA
    uid           [ unknown] HashiCorp Security (HashiCorp Package Signing) <security+packaging@hashicorp.com>
    sub   rsa4096 XXXX-XX-XX [E]
    ```
4. Add the Terraform/OpenTofu repositories to the apt sources.
    ```
    echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(grep -oP '(?<=UBUNTU_CODENAME=).*' /etc/os-release || lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
    ```
5. Update the apt packet cache and install Terraform/OpenTofu using `apt`.
    ```
    apt update && apt-get install terraform
    ```
6. Test the installation by running the `terraform version` command.


## Creating a first Instance using Terraform/OpenTofu

To create a first Instance using Terraform/OpenTofu, you need a declarative configuration file. This file contains all the information on machine characteristics required to deploy. It has to be written in the Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL). The deployment of Scaleway resources is done using the [Scaleway Provider for Terraform/OpenTofu](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/scaleway/index.html). For more information about HCL, refer to the [official documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax.html).

1. Create a project folder (for example `scaleway-terraform`) and navigate into the newly created directory:
    ```
    mkdir scaleway-terraform && cd scaleway-terraform
    ```
2. Create a new text file called `scaleway.tf` in a text editor of your choice. In the example below, we use `nano`.
    ```
    nano scaleway.tf
    ```
3. Add the following content to the file to deploy a Development DEV1-L Instance running the Ubuntu Jammy Jellyfish (22.04 LTS) base image in the `fr-par-1` zone. Replace `<SCW_ACCESS_KEY>` and `<SCW_SECRET_KEY>` with your own [API key information](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)  and `<SCW_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID>` with your own Project ID:
    ```json
      terraform {
        required_providers {
          scaleway = {
            source = "scaleway/scaleway"
          }
        }
        required_version = ">= 0.13"
      }
      provider "scaleway" {
        access_key      = "<SCW_ACCESS_KEY>"
        secret_key      = "<SCW_SECRET_KEY>"
        project_id	    = "<SCW_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID>"
        zone            = "fr-par-1"
        region          = "fr-par"
      }
      resource "scaleway_instance_ip" "public_ip" {}
      resource "scaleway_block_volume" "data" {
        size_in_gb = 30
        iops = 5000
      }
      resource "scaleway_instance_server" "my-instance" {
        type  = "DEV1-L"
        image = "ubuntu_jammy"

        tags = ["terraform instance", "my-instance"]

        ip_id = scaleway_instance_ip.public_ip.id

        additional_volume_ids = [scaleway_block_volume.data.id]

        root_volume {
          # The local storage of a DEV1-L Instance is 80 GB, subtract 30 GB from the additional block volume, then the root volume needs to be 50 GB.
          size_in_gb = 50
        }
      }
    ```

    Save the file and exit the text editor.

    <Message type="note">
      Though it is the simplest way for a beginner, we do not generally recommend hard-coding your API key credentials into the configuration file. See the [Authentication section of official Scaleway Terraform/OpenTofu documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/scaleway/scaleway/latest/docs/#authentication) to find out about other ways to manage your credentials.

4. Run `terraform init` to load the newly created configuration file into Terraform/OpenTofu:
    ```
    terraform init
    ```
5. Plan the execution of the tasks to be done by terraform using the command `terraform plan`:
    ```
    terraform plan
      Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan.
      Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
        + create

      Terraform will perform the following actions:

      Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't
      guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
    ```
6. Apply the new configuration and create the Instance using Terraform/OpenTofu by running `terraform apply`, if the output obtained is the same as the one above. Confirm the execution of the plan by typing `yes` when prompted:
    ```
    terraform apply

      Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are
      indicated with the following symbols:
        + create

      Terraform will perform the following actions:

        # scaleway_block_volume.data will be created

      Do you want to perform these actions?
        Terraform will perform the actions described above.
        Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

        Enter a value:
    ```
7. Enter `yes` to confirm.

    ```

## Modifying an Instance using Terraform/OpenTofu

We now have a first Instance up and running. Next, we will modify it by restricting access using [security groups](/instances/how-to/use-security-groups/). We are going to `DROP` all traffic to the Instance by default: only traffic to ports 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS) and 22 (SSH) will be allowed. To do this, we have to add some more lines to our existing configuration file `scaleway.tf`.

<Message type="important">
  All changes made to the local configuration file are not effective in production before the new configuration is applied using the `terraform apply` command.
</Message>

1. Open the configuration file `scaleway.tf` in a text editor and edit it as follows. To modify our Instance, we add a `scaleway_instance_security_group` resource, and the `security_group_id` identifier to our existing `scaleway_instance_server` resource.
    ```json

    ```
    terraform apply
    ```
    The following output should display:
    ```

## Adding resources to an infrastructure

Terraform/OpenTofu allows us to add additional resources to infrastructures and is capable of managing both [Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/) and [Elastic Metal servers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/elastic-metal/). Let us add an Elastic Metal server to our Terraform/OpenTofu project using the [Elastic Metal module](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/scaleway/r/baremetal_server.html) of the Scaleway provider.

1.  Open the file `scaleway.tf` in a text editor and add the `scaleway_account_ssh_key` data source and the `scaleway_baremetal_server` resource as follows:

    <Message type="note">
      Remember to replace the SSH key ID field with the ID for your own SSH key, available in [the SSH keys tab of your Project Dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/project/ssh-keys)
    </Message>

    ```json
    terraform {
      required_providers {
        scaleway = {
          source = "scaleway/scaleway"
        }
      }
      required_version = ">= 0.13"
    }

    provider "scaleway" {
      access_key      = "<SCW_ACCESS_KEY>"
      secret_key      = "<SCW_SECRET_KEY>"
      project_id      = "<SCW_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID>"
      zone            = "fr-par-1"
      region          = "fr-par"
      }
      resource "scaleway_instance_ip" "public_ip" {}
      resource "scaleway_block_volume" "data" {
        size_in_gb = 30
        iops = 5000
      }
    resource "scaleway_instance_security_group" "my-security-group" {
      inbound_default_policy  = "drop"
      outbound_default_policy = "accept"

      inbound_rule {
        action = "accept"
        port   = "22"
      }

      inbound_rule {
        action = "accept"
        port   = "80"
      }

      inbound_rule {
        action = "accept"
        port   = "443"
      }
    }
      resource "scaleway_instance_server" "my-instance" {
        type  = "DEV1-L"
        image = "ubuntu_jammy"

        tags = ["terraform instance", "my-instance"]

        ip_id = scaleway_instance_ip.public_ip.id

        additional_volume_ids = [scaleway_block_volume.data.id]

        root_volume {
          # The local storage of a DEV1-L Instance is 80 GB, subtract 30 GB from the additional block volume, then the root volume needs to be 50 GB.
          size_in_gb = 50
        }
        security_group_id = scaleway_instance_security_group.my-security-group.id
    }
    data "scaleway_account_ssh_key" "my_ssh_key" {
      ssh_key_id  = "<SSH-KEY-ID>"
    }
    data "scaleway_baremetal_offer" "my_offer" {
      zone = "fr-par-2"
      name = "EM-B112X-SSD"
    }
    data "scaleway_baremetal_os" "my_os" {
      zone    = "fr-par-2"
      name    = "Ubuntu"
      version = "22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)"
    }
    resource "scaleway_baremetal_server" "my_server" {
      zone        = "fr-par-2"
      offer       = data.scaleway_baremetal_offer.my_offer.offer_id
      os           = data.scaleway_baremetal_os.my_os.os_id
      ssh_key_ids = [data.scaleway_account_ssh_key.my_ssh_key.id]
    }
    ```

2. Apply the new configuration using `terraform apply`. Terraform/OpenTofu will add an Elastic Metal server to the existing infrastructure

  The creation of an Elastic Metal server may take up to several minutes.

## Storing the Terraform/OpenTofu state in the cloud

Optionally, you can store your Terraform/OpenTofu state with [Scaleway Object Storage](https://www.scaleway.com/en/object-storage/). Configure your backend as follows:

```json
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket                      = "terraform_state"
    key                         = "my_state.tfstate"
    region                      = "fr-par"
    access_key                  = "<SCW_ACCESS_KEY>"
    secret_key                  = "<SCW_SECRET_KEY>"
    skip_credentials_validation = true
    skip_region_validation      = true
    skip_requesting_account_id  = true
    endpoints = {
      s3  = "https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud"
    }
  }
}
```

## Deleting infrastructures using Terraform/OpenTofu

Now you have deployed a Terraform/OpenTofu infrastructure, modified its settings, and added additional resources. If you want to destroy the resources you have created, you can use the `terraform destroy` command.

1. Run `terraform destroy` in your terminal. The output shows you what will be destroyed.
2. Enter `yes` when prompted to enter a value.
3. Hit `Enter` to confirm. The output shows you the resources being deleted.

You have now managed the complete lifecycle of an infrastructure using Terraform/OpenTofu. To discover more Terraform/OpenTofu commands, use the `terraform -h` command. Common Terraform/OpenTofu commands include for example:

- `apply`: Builds or changes infrastructure
- `console`: Interactive console for Terraform/OpenTofu interpolations
- `destroy`: Destroy Terraform/OpenTofu-managed infrastructure env Workspace management
- `fmt`: Rewrites configuration files to canonical format
- `get`: Download and install modules for the configuration
- `graph`: Create a visual graph of Terraform/OpenTofu resources
- `import`: Import existing infrastructure into Terraform/OpenTofu
- `init`: Initialize a Terraform/OpenTofu working directory
- `output`: Read an output from a state file
- `plan`: Generate and show an execution plan
- `providers`: Prints a tree of the providers used in the configuration
- `refresh`: Update local state file against real resources
- `show`: Inspect Terraform/OpenTofu state or plan
- `taint`: Manually mark a resource for recreation
- `untaint`: Manually unmark a resource as tainted
- `validate` Validates the Terraform/OpenTofu files
- `version`: Prints the Terraform/OpenTofu version
- `workspace`: Workspace management

To create configurations that are shareable and version-controlled, it is recommended that you organize your code with modules. Modules are used to encapsulate logic and design a layer of abstraction for Terraform/OpenTofu code.

Most modules manage a few closely related resources from a single provider and allow you to parameterize the configurations. You can define variables to simplify the management of your infrastructure and duplicate it in no time.

For example, create a configuration file `variables.tf` in your Terraform/OpenTofu Project directory and edit it as follows:

```json
variable "zone" {
  default = "fr-par-1"
}
```

You have 3 options to use these variables:

- As an environment variable: `TF_VAR_zone=${var.zone} terraform apply`
- As a command-line parameter variable: `terraform apply -var zone=${var.zone}`
- As a variables file: `terraform apply -var-file=variables.tf`
