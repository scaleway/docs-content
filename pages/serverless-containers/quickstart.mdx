Scaleway Serverless Containers provides you with containerized stateless web applications deployed in the cloud. They are designed for short-lived, event-driven tasks.

<Message>
    For more details about Serverless advantages, [read Serverless Overview](/serverless-containers/reference-content/serverless-overview/).
</Message>

Containers rely on the HTTP protocol, and must therefore include a web server to work properly. Refer to the [differences between Containers, Jobs, and Functions](/serverless-containers/reference-content/difference-jobs-functions-containers/) for more information on Scaleway's different Serverless products.

This page explains how to deploy a basic NGINX image in a Serverless Container using the Scaleway console.

## Console Overview
Follow this guided tour to discover how to deploy a container using the console.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to deploy a Serverless Container

You can deploy a container from the Scaleway Container Registry or any other public container registry, such as Docker Hub, AWS Container registries, GitLab container registry, etc.

### Deploy from the Scaleway Container Registry

If you have no existing Serverless Containers resources in your current Project, the creation process will guide you through the creation of a namespace, and then a container.

<Message type="note">
  Make sure that you have [created a Container Registry namespace](/container-registry/how-to/create-namespace/) and [pushed the latest NGINX Docker image](/container-registry/how-to/push-images/) (or any other image with a web server) to it.

## Going further

For advanced usage, such as larger projects with dependencies, automation, multiple containers, and more, there are [several ways to deploy containers](/serverless-containers/reference-content/deploy-container/).
