Identity and Access Management (IAM) is now available to manage users and applications' access to objects and buckets. In each Scaleway Project, you can now give permissions to create, read, edit and/or delete object and buckets.

You can find a list of the new Object Storage permission sets in the [IAM permission sets](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/) documentation page.
