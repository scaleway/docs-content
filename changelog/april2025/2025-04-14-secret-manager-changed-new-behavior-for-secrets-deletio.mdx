When deleted, secrets and versions are now kept as "scheduled for deletion" for 7 days. Secret versions scheduled for deletion are free. They cannot be accessed during this period and can be restored for a cost of 1 cent per version.
  
This feature protects infrastructures and applications from the impacts of accidental deletion of secrets or malicious actions.
