Docker is an open-source containerization platform. Docker allows developers to package their applications into containers, using OS-level virtualization. This page shows you how to create an Instance with Docker preinstalled using the Docker [InstantApp](/compute/instances/concepts/#instantapp) based on Ubuntu 22.04, and then how to start using Docker for your containerization projects. By default, this image supports [routed IPs](/compute/instances/api-cli/using-routed-ips/).

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)

## Creating and connecting to your Docker InstantApp Instance

1. Create the Instance by [following our dedicated instructions](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/). When choosing your **Image**, click the **InstantApps** tab and select the **Docker** InstantApp.
2. [Connect to your Instance via SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).

## Building your first container

Docker allows you to ship applications in containers. Containers are standardized units of software that bundle the application's code and all its dependencies into one package, so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. This is a text document that contains all the commands a user would execute on the command line to assemble an image.

Here, we create a new Dockerfile for a small Python web application with [Flask](/tutorials/flask), that will run on the Instance:

1. Create a new directory to develop your environment.
    ```
    mkdir my-application
    ```
2. Enter the directory:
    ```
    cd my-application
    ```
3. Type `nano Dockerfile` to create a new file, called `Dockerfile`.

4. Copy and paste the following content into `Dockerfile` and save:
    ```
    # Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
    FROM python:3.7-slim

    # Set the working directory to /app
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
    ADD . /app

    # Install the Flask framework
    RUN pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org Flask

    # Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
    EXPOSE 80

    # Define environment variable
    ENV NAME World

    # Run app.py when the container launches
    CMD ["python", "app.py"]
    ```

    The Dockerfile is now ready, and we can proceed to creating the application.
5. Open a text editor, copy and paste the following content, and save the file as `app.py`:
    ```py
    from flask import Flask
    import os
    import socket

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route("/")
    def hello():

        html = "<h1>Hello {name}!</h1>" \
              "<b>Hostname:</b> {hostname}<br/>"
        return html.format(name=os.getenv("NAME", "world"), hostname=socket.gethostname(),)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=80)
    ```

    The application will run a simple web server on port 80 and return the values of the environment variable `NAME` set in the Dockerfile, as well as the hostname of the container when it is running.
6. Build the image. The `-t` tag is used to set a friendly name for the image:
    ```
    docker build -t helloworld .
    ```

    Docker now downloads the Python base image and processes the tasks defined in the Dockerfile to create the image for our application:

    ```

    ```

    The image is now available in the local docker registry:

    ```
    docker image ls

    REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
    helloworld   latest    a2cd192b6a93   41 seconds ago   137MB
    ```

## Running the application

Run the application with the `-p` option to map the port 4000 of your Instance to port 80 of the container:

```code
docker run -p 4000:80 helloworld
```

A message displays, showing that the application called `app` is running:

```
 * Serving Flask app 'app'
 * Debug mode: off
 WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:80
 * Running on http://172.17.0.2:80
 Press CTRL+C to quit
```

The message displays the information that the application is running on port `80`.

Remember, this is the internal port of the container. To reach the application, type `http://your_instances_ip:4000` in the address bar of your browser:

<Lightbox src="scaleway-docker_app_running.webp" alt="" />

The application displays the internal hostname of the container and retrieves the word "World" from the environment variable that was set in the Dockerfile.

### Sharing the application

Docker makes it easy to ship images to a registry to share with others.

In this example, the public Docker registry is used ("Docker Hub"), but it is also possible to set up a [private registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/) to distribute the image on your infrastructure, or to use the [Scaleway Container Registry](/containers/container-registry/quickstart/).

  You need a Docker account for this part of the tutorial. If you do not have one, you can create an account at [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com).

1. Log in to the Docker registry:
    ```code
    docker login
    ```
2. Tag the image, using the `docker tag` command followed by the notation `yourimageID yourusername/yourrepository:tag`. This associates your local image with a repository on the registry. The tag at the end is not mandatory but recommended, as it is the mechanism that registries use to give Docker images a version.
    ```code
    docker tag yourimageID yourusername/yourepository:tag
    ```
3. Push your image to the Docker Hub:
    ```code
    docker push myusername/myrepository:tag
    ```
   An output similar to the following displays:
    ```
    The push refers to repository [docker.io/yourusername/yourrepository]
    9d626cf8e4b7: Pushed
    84b2ed30b56f: Pushed
    403c7edd8408: Pushed
    b8594deafbe5: Mounted from library/python
    8a55150afecc: Mounted from library/python
    ad34ffec41dd: Mounted from library/python
    f19cb1e4112d: Mounted from library/python
    d310e774110a: Mounted from library/python
    tag: digest: sha256:4378dcea4f8452feff54ceb3d063598e1758581207f9d0e5a207ec93fba52cf3 size: 1995

    Once the image has been pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) it will be publicly available, and you can see the image with its pull command in your account.

### Pulling and running an image from a remote repository

Your image is now available on the Docker Hub, and you can run it from anywhere.

```code
docker run -p 4000:80 yourusername/yourrepository:tag
```

If the image is not available yet on the local machine, Docker will automatically download (pull) it from the registry.

No matter on which machine you run it, it will always run in the same environment that you configured when you built the image.
