This page shows how to migrate to the new version of Scaleway Messaging and Queuing that was recently released. The migration process depends on the messaging protocols you use. If you were not using Scaleway Messaging and Queuing before 16 October 2023, this document does not concern you.

For an in-depth explanation of the migration process, billing and General Availability, see our [dedicated reference documentation](/serverless/messaging/reference-content/migration/).

## NATS

NATS namespaces and credentials created with Scaleway Messaging and Queuing before October 16 2023 **have been automatically migrated to the new version**.

1. Log in to the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) and click **Messaging** in the side menu, then click **NATS**. You see that your NATS namespaces have now become [NATS accounts](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#nats-account). The credentials of your namespaces are now credentials of your NATS accounts.

2. **Update your endpoints in your code and applications.** The endpoint of your Scaleway Messaging and Queuing NATS service has changed. The new endpoint is displayed in the console.

<Message type="important">
You **must** update the endpoint in any code or applications using these endpoints.  After 30 days, the old endpoints will no longer be supported.<br/>
<br/>
If you use the API to manage your resources, you should use the new `v1beta1` version of the Messaging and Queuing NATS API going forward. This is available on the [Scaleway developers website](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/).

## SQS

SQS namespaces, credentials and queues created with Scaleway Messaging and Queuing before October 16 2023 **are not automatically migrated**. You must carry out the following steps to migrate, essentially **recreating your resources** in the new version and updating your code and applications accordingly.

1. Log in to the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) and click **Messaging** in the side menu.

2. [Activate the SQS protocol](/serverless/messaging/how-to/get-started/#how-to-activate-sqs-or-sns).

    You see that your previous namespaces and queues are not present in the console. This is because the console now uses the new version of Messaging and Queuing, and you must recreate your SQS resources.

3. [Create new credentials](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-credentials/) for your SQS service.

4. [Create new queues](/serverless/messaging/how-to/create-manage-queues/#how-to-create-a-queue) for your SQS service.

5. **Update your endpoints in your code and applications.** The endpoint of your Scaleway Messaging and Queuing SQS service has changed. The new endpoint is displayed in the console.

<Message type="important">
You **must** update the endpoint in any code or applications using these endpoints.  After 30 days, the old endpoints will no longer be supported.<br/>
<br/>
If you use the API to manage your resources, you should use the new `v1beta1` version of the Messaging and Queuing SQS API going forward. This is available on the [Scaleway developers website](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/). Note that your previous resources (SQS namespaces, queues etc) still exist on the old `v1alpha1` version of the API, which you can also access, but after 30 days these resources will be deleted.
