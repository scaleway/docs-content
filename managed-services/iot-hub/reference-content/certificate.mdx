As a security measure, Scaleway IoT Hub was designed with a mutual Transport Layer Security (TLS) as the default authentication protocol. This means each device needs both a certificate and key pair to connect to IoT Hub.

Using a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) to issue digital certificates is essential to guarantee a secure Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection between a device and the IoT Hub. A digital certificate contains important information about the server's identify that can help verify its authenticity, then allowing the device to use it to establish a secure connection with the server.

However, the current Certificate Authority of the IoT Hub server endpoint is set to expire **in February 2024**.

The information provided on this page explains what the migration entails and how to successfully transition to the new CA.

<Message type="note">
  It is possible to replace the Scaleway-generated default certificate with either a self-generated or third-party certificate. If this applies to you and your devices do not use TLS, the information contained within this page will not pertain to you.

The CA is a `.pem` bundle that currently contains both the soon-to-be expired and new CA. This is part of our strategy to make the transition seamless to you.

# Planning the migration

As of now, a new IoT Hub endpoint is available: `migration.iot.fr-par-scw.cloud`. It acts exactly like `iot.fr-par-scw.cloud`, which is the endpoint Scaleway users have habitually been provided with. Starting now, you can connect to this new endpoint. The only difference is that it will identify itself with the new part of the certificate bundle.

On **26 September 2023**, the old certificate for the `iot.fr-par-scw.cloud` endpoint will be changed for one signed by the new CA.

On **30 January 2024**, the migration endpoint will be deactivated. You will only be able to connect to the main `iot.fr-par-scw.cloud` endpoint.

Two options are available to you, depending on what your device allows.

## Your device can use a CA bundle 

1. Log into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
2. Click **IoT Hub** on the side menu. The IoT Hub creation page displays.
3. Click one of your hub's name. You are redirected to the **Overview** section of your hub.
4. Click the **Networks** tab. Find the network with the `iot.fr-par.scw.cloud` endpoint.
5. **Click the <Icon name="[download]"/> Download icon next to the endpoint to download the CA.** The downloaded certificate is signed by both the old and new Certificate Authority.
6. **Try connecting to the dedicated migration endpoint** using the newly downloaded CA. If it succeeds, your device supports the use of a Certificate Authority bundle.
