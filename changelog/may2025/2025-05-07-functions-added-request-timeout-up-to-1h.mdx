Serverless Functions now support a request timeout of up to one hour. This significant increase in timeout duration opens up new possibilities for long-running tasks and workloads. With this update, you can now use Serverless Functions for a wider range of use cases, such as: 
* Running complex data processing tasks that require extended execution times
* Hosting long-running webhooks or callbacks that need to handle prolonged requests
* Supporting real-time data streaming applications that require continuous processing
* Enabling wider usage of websockets
