In this tutorial, you will learn how to use your own Grafana with [Scaleway's Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/quickstart/) service. In this tutorial, we are using Grafana version 9.5.1.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Installed [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- Downloaded the [latest version of Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/download/)

## Launching Grafana

1. Run the following command to launch Grafana in a Docker container on your local machine:

        ```bash
        docker run -d -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana-oss:9.5.1
        ```
2. [Create a token](/observability/cockpit/how-to/create-token/) with the following permissions:
    - Query metrics
    - Query logs
    - Query traces
    - Rules for metrics
    - Rules for logs
    - Alerts

3. Copy your token's secret key as you will need it for the following steps.
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in a web browser on your local computer to access Grafana.
5. Sign up using `admin` as your username and password. You will then be prompted to change your password.

## Creating your data source for metrics

1. From the Grafana homepage, click **Add your first data source**.
      <Lightbox src="scaleway_cockpit_tuto_data_source.webp" alt="" />
2. Select the Prometheus data source in the list that displays.
3. Retrieve the URL of the metrics data source you want to add from the [Data sources tab](https://console.scaleway.com/cockpit/dataSource/) of the Scaleway console. Make sure that the region in the URL is the one where your data source is located.
4. Add `/prometheus` at the end of the URL. Your metrics' URL should look like the following:
    ```bash
    https://xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.metrics.cockpit.fr-par.scw.cloud/prometheus
    ```
5. Paste your metrics' URL in the **URL** field of the **HTTP** section.
6. From the **Custom HTTP Headers** section, click **+ Add header**.
7. Enter `X-Token` in the **Header** field.
8. Enter your token's secret key in the **Value** field.
9. From the **Type and version** section, select **Prometheus** in the **Prometheus type** drop-down.
10. Select the latest version in the **Prometheus version** drop-down.
