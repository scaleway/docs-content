## How is my environmental footprint calculated?

Our calculation methodology was developed in collaboration with the green IT specialist consultancy firm [IJO](https://ijo.tech/index.html), ensuring a rigorous and expert-validated approach to assessing environmental impact accurately and transparently.

Our methodology is based on the ADEME (French Government Agency for Ecological Transition) [Product Category Rules (PCR) for Datacenter and Cloud services](https://librairie.ademe.fr/produire-autremenqt6105-methodological-standard-for-the-environmental-assessment-of-datacenter-it-hosting-services-and-cloud-services.html), which provide a standardized framework for calculating and reporting the environmental impact of data centers and cloud services. These rules are designed to ensure consistency, transparency, and comparability in the assessment of environmental footprints across the industry.

Refer to the [environmental footprint calculation breakdown](/environmental-footprint/additional-content/environmental-footprint-calculator) for a detailed report of how our calculations are made and what data is used.

## Why does my environmental impact data vary over time?

Your environmental impact data may change due to updates in the energy mix of data center locations, adjustments to PUE, or enhancements in our calculation methodology. These updates ensure that your reports reflect the most accurate and up-to-date information, enhancing transparency and trust in our reporting system.
