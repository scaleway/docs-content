## Folder

Folders are the underlying structure for organizing and grouping your secrets in one place. Folders are always within a [path](#path).

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Path

Paths refer to the access paths to your folders and secrets. They contain your folders, secrets and versions. Each path is prefixed with a slash.

For example, if you create a folder `my-folder` within the path `/my-path`, your folder can be accessed at the `/my-path/my-folder` path.

<Message type="important">
  - A path can only contain folder names of 1 to 255 alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores and dashes.
  - If you leave the path name field empty when creating your folders or secrets, the default path will be `/`. Your folders and secrets will be under the `/` path.

## Secret Manager

Secret Manager is a solution that provides a centralized location where your secrets can be stored and accessed. Its primary purpose is to securely store secrets, thus eliminating the need for developers to hard code sensitive information in applications or configuration files.

With Secret Manager, you can also share sensitive data such as passwords, API keys and certificates.

Scaleway's Secret Manager can be managed using [APIs](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/secret-manager/) and the Scaleway [CLI](https://www.scaleway.com/en/cli/), which allow authorized applications or services to retrieve secrets securely. This enables you to automate a deployment by fetching your passwords stored on Secret Manager through the API, and storing them in your environment variables, which will then be used by your application.
