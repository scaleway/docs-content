[Object Storage](https://www.scaleway.com/en/object-storage/) allows you to import a copy of your objects in a bucket to another bucket using the [AWS-CLI](/storage/object/api-cli/object-storage-aws-cli/).

The `sync` command is used to synchronize directories and S3 prefixes. 

This command will: 

- Recurringly copy new and updated files from the source directory to the target one
- Use the `CopyObject` APIs to list objects in the source and target buckets and identify which ones they have in common
- Compare both to determine disparities in `LastModified` dates between the same objects

<Message type="note">

When applied on a versioned bucket, the sync command copies only the most recent version of the objects.

  - You have [created an Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)

## Importing copied objects from the same project

To import copied objects to a bucket in the same [Project](/console/my-project/quickstart/), use the `aws s3 sync` command.

<Message type="important">

Before importing a copy, make sure all of the source bucket's objects are in `STANDARD` class. If an object is in `GLACIER` class, the copy import will fail. To learn how to change storage classes, refer to this [documentation page](/storage/object/how-to/change-object-class)

</Message>

```
aws s3 sync s3://$SourceBucket s3://$TargetBucket
```

Replace `$SourceBucket` with the name of the bucket where the copy is currently stored, and `$TargetBucket` with the name of the bucket the copy will be stored in. 

## Importing copied objects from a different project

To import a copy of objects in a bucket to another bucket in a different [Project](/console/my-project/quickstart/), you need to implement a [bucket policy](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy).

A **Bucket Policy** is a resource-based policy option. In this context, Bucket Policies are used to grant the target Project access to the source bucket.

<Message type="important">

Before importing a copy, make sure all of the source bucket's objects are in `STANDARD` class. If an object is in `GLACIER` class, it will not be copied nor imported to the target bucket.

1. Create a file with your Bucket Policy for the source bucket.

	<Message type="note">

	Bucket policies use a JSON-based access policy language. You can find more details about the JSON policy grammar on [this page](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy).

	```json
	{
			"Version": "2012-10-17",
			"Id":"MyBucketPolicy",
			"Statement": [
					{
							"Sid": "DelegateS3Access",
							"Effect":"Allow",
							"Principal":{
									"SCW":"project_id:<TARGET_PROJECT_ID>"
							},
							"Action":[
									"s3:ListBucket",
									"s3:GetObject"
							],
							"Resource":[
									"<BUCKET_NAME>",
									"<BUCKET_NAME>/*"
							]
					}
			]
	}

	```
2. Run the following command:

	```bash
	$ aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket <SOURCE_BUCKET> --profile <SOURCE_PROJECT> --policy file://bucket-policy.json
	``` 
3. If necessary, create the target bucket in the target project.

  ```json
  $ aws s3api create-bucket --bucket <TARGET_BUCKET> --profile <TARGET_PROJECT>
  {
    "Location": "/<TARGET_BUCKET>"
  }
  ```
4. Copy objects and import using the `sync` command.

5. Replace `<SOURCE_BUCKET>` with the name of the bucket located in the source project and `<TARGET_BUCKET>` with the name of the bucket in the target project. 

  ```bash
  $ aws s3 sync s3://<SOURCE_BUCKET> s3://<TARGET_BUCKET> --profile <TARGET_PROJECT>
  ```
