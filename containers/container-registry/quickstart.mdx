Scaleway [Container Registry](/containers/container-registry/concepts/#container-registry) is a fully-managed mutualised container registry, designed to facilitate the storage, management and deployment of container images. The service simplifies the development-to-production workflow, as there is no need to operate your own Container Registry or to worry about the underlying infrastructure. You can create your Container Registry namespace, connect it to the Docker CLI, then use Docker to push and pull images to and from your registry. When you no longer need an image, you can delete it from your Container Registry.

## How to create a Container Registry namespace

1. Click **Container Registry** in the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. If you do not have a Registry already created, the product creation page is displayed.
2. Click **Create namespace** to launch the namespace creation wizard.
3. Enter the following required information for your namespace:
    * The **Name** for the namespace
    * A **Description** of the namespace 
    * The geographical **Region** of the namespace
    * The namespace's **Privacy Policies**

    <Message type="note">
      A namespace can either be [public or private](/containers/container-registry/concepts/#namespace-privacy-policies). Anyone will be able to pull container images from a public namespace. Privacy policies may be set at image level.
    </Message>
4. Click **Create namespace** to create the namespace.

## How to connect your namespace to the Docker CLI

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have installed [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on your local computer
  - You have [generated your API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
</Message>

1. Click **Container Registry** in the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Container Registry namespaces dashboard displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" />, then **Push Instructions** next to the namespace you want to push to. A pop-up displays.
3. Copy the push instructions. Then click **OK** to close the pop-up.
4. Open a terminal window on your local computer. Then log into the namespace by running the following command from the terminal:
    ```
    docker login rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/mynamespace -u nologin -p [SCW_SECRET_KEY]
    ```

    <Message type="important">
      Replace `[SCW_SECRET_KEY]` with your [API Secret Key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) and `mynamespace` with the name of your namespace.
    </Message>

    Once logged in, a confirmation is displayed:

    ```
    Login Succeeded
    ```

You are now logged in and ready to push and pull images to and from your Container Registry with Docker.

## How to push an image to your Container Registry namespace

<Message type="note">
  We use an Ubuntu image as an example here.
</Message>

1. Open a terminal window on your local computer. 
2. Pull the latest release of the [Ubuntu](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu/) docker image:

    docker pull ubuntu:latest
    ```
3. Tag the image:
    ```
    docker tag ubuntu:latest rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/mynamespace/ubuntu:latest
    ```
4. Push the image to your Container Registry namespace using docker:
    ```
    docker push rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/mynamespace/ubuntu:latest
    ```

<Message type="important">
  Replace `mynamespace` in the examples above with the name of your namespace.
</Message>
