VPC allows you to build your own **V**irtual **P**rivate **C**loud on top of Scaleway's shared public cloud. One default VPC per region is automatically created per Scaleway [Project](/console/project/concepts/#project), and you can create more if you wish. Within each VPC, you can create **Private Networks** and attach Scaleway resources (Instances, Elastic Metal servers, Load Balancers etc.) to them, as long as the resources are within the network's region. Attached resources can then communicate between themselves in an isolated and secure virtual layer 2 network, away from the public Internet. More features and resources will be coming to the VPC product in the future.

## How to identify your default VPCs

One default VPC per region is automatically created per Scaleway [Project](/console/project/concepts/#project). You can [create more](/network/vpc/how-to/create-vpc/) if you wish, but it is not necessary for basic use cases.

Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the Scaleway console side menu. Your [VPC dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/vpc/vpc) displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-default-vpc.webp" alt="" />

You see three default VPCs, one for each of the following regions:

- Paris `PAR`
- Amsterdam `AMS`
- Warsaw `WAW`

Any new Private Networks that you create will be added to the default VPC for their region, unless you override this by specifying a different VPC. 

## How to create a Private Network

1. Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the side menu. The list of your VPCs displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-default-vpc.webp" alt="" />

    Each Private Network must be created within a VPC. 

2. Click the VPC you wish to create your Private Network in.

    If you already have existing Private Networks in this VPC, a list of these displays. Otherwise, you see a welcome screen.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-pn-welcome.webp" alt="" />

3. Click **+ Create Private Network**. The creation screen displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-pn.webp" alt=""/>

4. Enter a **name** for the network, or leave the randomly-generated name in place. Optionally, you can also add **tags** to help organize your Private Networks. Each tag should be separated by a space.

    Leave the Advanced Settings at default values, to create a network with an auto-generated CIDR block, which will be used by DHCP to assign private IP addresses to resources you attach to the network.

5. Click **Create Private Network** to finish. Your Private Network is created.

## How to attach a resource to a Private Network

1. Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the side menu. Your VPC [dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/vpc/vpc) displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-default-vpc.webp" alt="" />

2. Click the VPC containing the Private Network to which you want to attach a resource.

    A list of Private Networks in this VPC displays.

3. Click the Private Network to which you want to attach a resource.

    The Private Network's dashboard displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-pn-overview.webp" alt="" />

4. Click the **Attached resources** tab.

    If you already have resources attached to the Private Network, a list of these displays. Otherwise, you see a welcome screen.

5. Click **+Attach resource**. The following screen displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-attach-resource.webp" alt="" />

6. Select the type of resource (Instance, Elastic Metal server etc.) that you want to attach. Then select the specific resource to attach. Only resources within the same region (or one of its Availability Zones) as the Private Network will be displayed.

7. Click **Attach resource** to finish.

    You are returned to the list of attached resources, where the newly-attached resource now displays.

## How to view the resource's IP address

When you attach a resource to a Private Network, it is automatically assigned an IPv4 and IPv6 address on that network. This is assigned from the [CIDR block](/network/vpc/how-to/create-private-network/#how-to-configure-cidr) defined at the time of the Private Network's creation.

You can view a resource's IPv4 or v6 address in the **Attached Resources** tab of the Private Network itself (follow steps 1 - 5 above)

<Lightbox src="scaleway-attached-resources.webp" alt="" />

It can also be viewed via the **Private Networks** tab of the resource's own dashboard.

## How to delete a Private Network

1. Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the side menu.

    Each Private Network exists within a VPC.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-default-vpc.webp" alt="" />

2. Click the VPC containing the Private Network you want to delete.

    A list of your Private Networks in this VPC displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-pns.webp" alt="" />

3. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the Private Network you want to delete, then click **Delete** on the pop-up menu.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-delete-pn.webp" alt="" />

    A screen displays asking you to confirm that you want to delete the network, and that you have detached all resources from it.

4. Type **DELETE** and click **Delete Private Network**.

  Your Private Network is deleted.
