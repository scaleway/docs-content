Distributed Data Lab is a product designed to assist data scientists and data engineers in performing calculations on a remotely managed Apache Spark infrastructure.

It is composed of the following components:

  - Cluster: A Spark cluster with a Lighter component responsible for creating the computation pods when the notebook is in use.

  - Notebook: A JupyterLab service operating on a dedicated node type.

Scaleway provides dedicated node types for both the Notebook and the Cluster. The Cluster nodes are high-end machines built for intensive computations, featuring numerous CPUs and substantial RAM. 

The Notebook, although capable of performing some local computations, primarily serves as a web interface for interacting with the Spark cluster.

<Macro id="requirements">

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)

1. Click **Data Lab** under **Managed Services** on the side menu.

2. Click **Create Database Instance**. The creation wizard displays.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Choose an Apache Spark version from the drop-down menu.
    - Set up your worker nodes by selecting a configuration, and by indicating a number of Apache Spark nodes.
    - Choose an Object Storage bucket in the desired region to store the configuration files, the output and the dependencies.
    - Enter a name for your Data Lab.
    - Optionnaly, add a description and/or tags for your Data Lab.
    - Verify the estimated cost.

4. Click **Create Data Lab cluster** to finish. You are directed to the Data Labs clusters list.
