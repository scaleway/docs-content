- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

1. Click **IAM & API keys** on the top-right drop-down menu of the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) displays.

2. Click the name of the user whose permissions you want to view. The user information page displays.
    <Message type="tip">
    To view your own permissions in someone else's Organization, you can follow the same process and click on your name. If you cannot see your own permissions, contact an admin of the Organization, as you may not have the necessary permissions.
    </Message>
3. Scroll to the **Permission sets** section.

A list of your permission sets for the selected Organization displays. You can see the scope of the permissions, in which [IAM policy](/iam/concepts/#policy) they were defined, and to which [principal](/iam/concepts/#principal) they are attached to.
