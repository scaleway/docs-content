If you are using Scaleway Object Storage, you might not want the `scw.cloud` domain name to appear in your bucket's URL. This may be the case if, for example, you are providing files to download or hosting the images of your website from a bucket. You may prefer a domain name such as `download.mywebsite.com` to display on your links, instead of `download.mywebsite.com.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud`.

In this tutorial, we show you how to use CNAME to map a domain or subdomain to an Object Storage bucket and access the files stored in the bucket via your own domain name.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have access to the [DNS zone](/network/domains-and-dns/concepts/#dns-zone) of your domain name
</Message>

1. From the Scaleway console, [create a new bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/). When entering a name for your bucket, the name must be exactly the same as the domain/subdomain intended to be used with it. For example, to create a bucket accessible at `download.example.com` the bucket name must be `download.example.com`.
2. Set the bucket ACL with [AWS-CLI](/storage/object/api-cli/object-storage-aws-cli/):
    ```
    aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket download.example.com --acl public-read
    ```
3. Log into the administration panel of your domain and create a new record that defines the hostname as an alias for the bucket. For example, if the bucket `download.example.com` is located in the Paris region, the CNAME should point to `download.example.com.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud.`:

<Lightbox src="scaleway-bucket_cname.webp" alt="" />

You can now access the file `myapp.tar.gz` stored in the bucket `download.example.com` directly at `http://download.example.com/myapp.tar.gz` instead of the usual URL `http://download.example.com.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/myapp.tar.gz`.
