Odoo is a business management software, including different modules such as CRM, billing, e-commerce, warehouse, website builder, inventory management, and accounting. The software is distributed in an open-code model, providing a free Community Edition, released under the GNU [LGPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html) software license. The source code of the Community Edition is available on [the company's GitHub](https://github.com/odoo/odoo). Besides the free and open-source Community Edition, a proprietary "Enterprise" version provides additional features and services.

The modular design of [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/) allows developers to create additional modules or apps and distribute them through the Odoo marketplace, which provides more than 20,000 modules. This makes Odoo a versatile and customizable solution that can be adapted to many usage scenarios.

This tutorial will show you how to deploy Odoo 14 on a Scaleway machine running Ubuntu Focal Fossa (20.04 LTS). This could be a [Dedibox](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/), an [Instance](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/) or an [Elastic Metal server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/elastic-metal/).


<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have [configured your SSH Key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- You have one of the following remote machines running Ubuntu Focal Fossa (20.04 LTS):
  - An [Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/)
  - An [Elastic Metal server](/compute/elastic-metal/how-to/create-server/)
  - A [Dedibox dedicated server](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/order-a-server/)
- You have sudo privileges or access to the root user
- You have configured an A-record pointing to your server's IP address

</Message> 

### Installation prework

1. Log in to your remote machine using SSH:

  ```
  ssh root@<remote_machine_ip>
  ```

  <Message type="note">
    
  If you are logging into a Dedibox server, you may not be able to log in as root but rather as the user you created during installation. In this case you may need to prefix commands in this tutorial with `sudo`.

  </Message>

2. Update the `apt` sources lists and upgrade the software already installed on the machine to the latest version available in Ubuntu's repositories:

  ```
  apt update && apt upgrade -y
  ```

3. Install PostgreSQL using the `apt` package manager using the command below. This is necessary because Odoo requires a PostgreSQL database to run. By default, the database engine has to be installed on the same server as Odoo. 

  ```
  apt install postgresql -y
  ```

4. Download the `wkhtmltox` package into the `/tmp` directory of your machine. This enables Odoo to generate printable PDF reports, and is a required package. 

  ```
  cd /tmp
  wget https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/packaging/releases/download/0.12.6-1/wkhtmltox_0.12.6-1.focal_amd64.deb
  ```

5. Install `xfonts` which is required by `wkhtmltox`:

  ```
  apt install xfonts-75dpi xfonts-base -y
  ```

6. Install the `wkhtmltox` package using `dpkg`:

  ```
  dpkg -i /tmp/wkhtmltox_0.12.6-1.focal_amd64.deb
  ```

  <Message type="tip">

    Any dependencies that are still missing will be flagged in your terminal output at this point. If you still have missing dependencies, you can install them with the command `apt-get -f install`

  </Message>

### Installing Odoo

1. Download and install the Odoo GPG key:

  ```
  wget -O - https://nightly.odoo.com/odoo.key | apt-key add -
  ```

2. Add the Odoo repository to the `apt` package manager via the `odoo.list` configuration file:

  ```
  echo "deb http://nightly.odoo.com/15.0/nightly/deb/ ./" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/odoo.list
  ```

3. Update the `apt` package manager to add the new repository to it:

  ```
  apt update
  ```

4. Install the Python dependencies for Odoo:

  ```
  apt install git fontconfig fontconfig-config fonts-dejavu-core libfontconfig1 libjpeg-turbo8 libxrender1 build-essential python3 python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-dev python3-venv python3-wheel libxslt1-dev libzip-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev node-less libjpeg-dev gdebi -y
  ```

5. Install the Python PIP requirements for Odoo:

  ```
  apt install python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libpq-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev libffi-dev -y
  ```

6. Install the remaining requirements using `pip3`:

  <Message type="note">
 
    This step may take a while.
 
  </Message>

  ```
  sudo -H pip3 install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/odoo/odoo/master/requirements.txt
  ```

7. Install Odoo using `apt`:

  ```
  apt install odoo
  ```

## Configuring Odoo

1. Open an Internet browser on your local computer and point it to `http://<your_remote_machine_ip>:8069`. The Odoo installation wizard displays:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-odoo14_install.webp" width="600" alt="" />

2. Enter the following information in the form:

    - **Master Password:** The master password for the Odoo database. By default an auto-generated value is pre-filled. You can change it to your own desired password if required.
    - **Database Name:** A name for the Odoo PostgreSQL database
    - **Email:** The email address of the admin user. It will also be used as an identifier to connect to Odoo
    - **Password:** A strong password for the Odoo admin user
    - **Phone number:** Your phone number
    - **Language:** Select the language for the Odoo web interface
    - **Country:** Select your country from the drop-down list
    - **Demo data:** Tick this box to fill up the Odoo database with demo data. This feature can be useful for testing the application.

  Once all data is filled in, click **Create database** to create the Odoo database and your first login. The application dashboard displays:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-odoo_app_dashboard.webp" width="900" alt="" />

3. (Optional): Click the **Install** button next to each app you want to install automatically on your Odoo server. You can see more details about each application by clicking on the **Learn More** button.

  To navigate around your installed apps, click the mosaic button in the top left corner and select your application from the list:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-odoo_menu.webp" width="135" alt="" />

  Odoo CRM module:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-odoo_crm.webp" width="900" alt="" />

  Odoo Discuss module with activated e-learning module:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-odoo_discuss.webp" width="900" alt="" />

## Setting up Nginx as a HTTPS Proxy

By default, the Odoo web server uses a plain HTTP connection to transport data. To make connections to the application more secure, we configure the Nginx web server as an HTTPS-proxy that will act as front-end for Odoo.

1. Install Nginx and `certbot` using `apt`:

  ```
  apt install nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx
  ```

2. Create a Nginx configuration file:

  <Message type="important">

    In this and future steps, be sure to replace `odoo.example.com` with your Odoo domain name

  </Message> 

  ```
  nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/odoo.example.com 

  ```
  
3. Put the following content into the file you created, then save and exit the file:

  ```
  upstream odoo {
  server 127.0.0.1:8069;
  }

  upstream odoochat {
  server 127.0.0.1:8072;
  }

  server {
      listen 80;
      server_name odoo.example.com;

      proxy_read_timeout 720s;
      proxy_connect_timeout 720s;
      proxy_send_timeout 720s;

      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;

      access_log /var/log/nginx/odoo.example.com.access.log;
      error_log /var/log/nginx/odoo.example.error.log;

      location /longpolling {
          proxy_pass http://odoochat;
      }

      location / {
        proxy_redirect off;
        proxy_pass http://odoo;
      }

      location ~* /web/static/ {
          proxy_cache_valid 200 90m;
          proxy_buffering on;
          expires 864000;
          proxy_pass http://odoo;
      }

      gzip_types text/css text/less text/plain text/xml application/xml application/json application/javascript;
      gzip on;
  }
  ```

4. Activate the site by creating a symlink in the `sites-enabled` directory:

  ```
  ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/odoo.example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
  ```

5. Run `certbot` to request a new certificate and configure Nginx. Follow the [instructions](/tutorials/configure-nginx-lets-encrypt/#installing-certbot-and-obtaining-a-certificate/) given during the certificate request:

  ```
  certbot --nginx
  ```

6. Open the file `/etc/odoo/odoo.conf` in a text editor and add the following lines to it to enable Proxy mode in Odoo and restrict connections to the application to `localhost` only, for security reasons:

  ```
  nano /etc/odoo/odoo.conf
  ```

  ```
  [options]
  [...]
  proxy_mode = True
  xmlrpc_interface = 127.0.0.1
  netrpc_interface = 127.0.0.1
  ```

7. Restart Odoo:

  ```
  systemctl restart odoo
  ```

  You can now access your Odoo via a secure HTTPS connection at `https://odoo.example.com`.

  To go further, refer to the [official Odoo documentation](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/user/14.0/index.html).
