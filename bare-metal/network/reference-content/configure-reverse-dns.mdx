Failover IP addresses allow you to have several IP addresses with your server. This allows you to assign IP addresses to different websites or to virtual machines.
Your IP failover can be routed at any time to your servers in just a few minutes by using our Account Management Console or through our API. By switching your failover IP addresses from one server to another, the hosted services remain available without reconfiguring the IP address.

You can add a failover IP address(es) for each server according to the offer and your service level.

      Make sure to have a valid **[A record](/scaleway-console/dns/concepts/#dns-record)** for forwarding DNS configured and pointing to your IP address before changing the reverse DNS of it.
