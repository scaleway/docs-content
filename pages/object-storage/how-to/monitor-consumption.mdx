You can view your Object Storage's metrics and logs using [Scaleway Cockpit](/cockpit/quickstart/). Scaleway Object Storage is fully integrated into Cockpit, and allows you to monitor your objects, storage usage, and bandwidth at a glance. This page explains how to get started with Scaleway Cockpit for viewing your Object Storage metrics and logs.

Cockpit is available in all [regions](/object-storage/concepts/#region-and-availability-zone) for Object Storage.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Object Storage bucket](/object-storage/how-to/create-a-bucket/)

## How to activate your Cockpit

Scaleway Cockpit is activated by default if you have created [Scaleway resources integrated with Cockpit](/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-product-integration).

## How to access the Grafana dashboard

1. From the Scaleway console [Cockpit overview page](https://console.scaleway.com/cockpit/overview), click **Access Grafana** in the top right corner.

2. Log in to Grafana. You are directed to the Scaleway Cockpit dashboard homepage.

3. Click **Dashboards** in the left menu, and select:
  - the **Object Storage Overview** dashboard in the **Scaleway** folder to access your metrics.
  - the **Object Storage Logs Overview** dashboard in the **Scaleway** folder to access your logs.

    You are directed to the selected dashboard. You can use the filters in the top left corner of the page to refine your metrics and logs.
