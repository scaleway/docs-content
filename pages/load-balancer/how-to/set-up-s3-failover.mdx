The **customized error page** feature allows you to redirect users to a static website hosted on Scaleway Object Storage, in the case that none of your Load Balancer's backends are available to serve the requested content. This website could be a simple, single webpage or else something much more complex: you build it according to your own requirements.

If you do not configure a customized error page, and none of your backend servers are available, your users will instead see a standard HTTP error displayed in their browser, e.g. `503 Service Unavailable`.

Benefits of using this feature include:
- Displaying customized, branded and user-friendly error messages
- Providing links to support resources or contact information
- Providing information on service status or maintenance
- Redirecting to a mirrored site or skeleton site

You can set up a customized error page during creation of your Load Balancer, or at any point after creation.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created a bucket which is hosting a [bucket website](/object-storage/how-to/use-bucket-website/)

## How to activate a customized error page failover during creation of your Load Balancer

1. Follow the instructions for [creating a Load Balancer](/load-balancer/how-to/create-load-balancer/).
2. Click the  **+Advanced Settings** button while configuring your backend.
    <Lightbox image={image} alt="" />
3. Slide the <Icon name="toggle" /> toggle to activate the customized error page feature, and enter a Scaleway Object Storage [Bucket Website](/object-storage/concepts/#bucket-website) URL in the box. Note that the URL of the bucket endpoint is not sufficient, the bucket website domain is specifically required, **without** a leading protocol (no `http://` or `https://)`. An example of correct formatting is `my-bucket.s3-website.nl-ams.scw.cloud`.
    <Message type="note">
      This feature is only available for Load Balancers using the HTTP protocol on their backend.
    </Message>
4. Click **Create frontend and backend** to finish.

## How to create a static website for your customized error page

Having activated the customized error page feature on your Load Balancer, you must ensure that you have created a static website or webpage to display. See our [dedicated documentation](/object-storage/how-to/use-bucket-website/) to learn how to create a static website with Scaleway Object Storage.
