## Alias

An email alias is an additional email address for an email account with which a user can send and receive emails or set forwards to. A single user account can have multiple email aliases with the same or different domains.

## Cloud hosting

Cloud hosting uses Scaleway cloud Instances for your hosting needs. With this option, you can benefit from all the technologies and features of the cloud. Cloud hosting solutions work with all CMS and PHP frameworks. Storage is via SSD, giving better performance.

## Email account

An email account is an email address in which mail is stored (unlike an alias / catchall). You can check your mail accounts via two protocols: POP3 and IMAP.

## FTP account

FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, is a protocol that allows you to transfer files between different computers over the internet. With our Webhosting service, you can transfer your files from your computer to Scaleway.com - for example, to update your website. It also works vice versa: you can recover the files stored on Scaleway.com and transfer them to your personal computer, for example to make a backup.

## Filtering

Filtering allows you to sort your emails depending on different criteria (the sender, the subject, the object and much more). If the email meets one or more criteria, you can define different actions (delete the email, move it into a folder, etc.).

## htaccess

`.htaccess` is a simple text file containing commands for the Apache web server configuration. It allows you to personalize the server dynamically and per folder. The configuration values are inherited through directories. Common applications for setting up a `.htaccess` file are switching between PHP4 and PHP5, partial website protection, website redirectioning, or error messages customization. Once on the server, its name must be `.htaccess` with a point ahead.

## PHP

PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development, but also used as a general-purpose programming language. While PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, it now stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, which is a recursive backronym.

## php.ini

The `php.ini` file is the configuration file used for applications that require PHP. It contains the configuration of variables such as upload sizes, file timeouts, and resource limits. At Scaleway, we provide PHP with the most common values preconfigured for each webhosting. If required, you can [customize the configuration of PHP](/dedibox-console/classic-hosting/how-to/configure-php/) towards your needs.

## Redirection

A redirection is an alternative email address for one or multiple email accounts of the same domain. For example, you can create the alias `[contact@example.com](mailto:contact@example.com)`, which will redirect the mail to the personal email account `[firstname.lastname@example.com](mailto:firstname.lastname@example.com)`.
This allows you to not only have multiple email addresses without needing multiple email accounts, but also to deliver the email to multiple recipients.
