title: New API endpoint - Failed Transfer Retry
status: added
date: 2025-10-29
category: domains-and-webhosting

It is now possible to retry a failed domain transfer directly through the API without contacting support.
If a transfer fails, for example, due to an incorrect transfer code, you can relaunch it independently and at no cost.
