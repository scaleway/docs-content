import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Dedibox resources are available in your organization.

This page explains how to grant IAM members access to the Dedibox Console using Scaleway Identity & Access Management (IAM).

## Concepts

Access to Dedibox resources is controlled through IAM:
- **Users**: IAM identities that represent a person or machine.
- **Groups**: Collections of users. Permissions can be assigned at the group level.
- **Policies**: Rules that define what actions a user or group can perform.

To allow an IAM member to access the Dedibox Console, you must attach a policy to the user or the group they belong to.

## Giving access to the Dedibox console for Scaleway IAM Members

### Create or select an IAM user

If the user does not exist:
1. In the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com), click **IAM** in the **Management & Governance** section of the side menu. The information dashboard appears.
2. Click **+ Create member**.
3. Enter the user information and validate.

If the user already exists, proceed to the next section.

### Create or assign a policy

To give the user access to Dedibox, attach an IAM policy with Dedibox permissions.
Policies can be created and attached directly to a user or a group.

#### Create a policy

1. In the IAM section, click the **Policies** tab.
2. Click **+ Create Policy**.
3. Enter a policy name and description. Optionally, add key-value tags and select a principal.
4. Click **Add rules**. The rule creation wizard appears.
5. Define the scope of the rule — either at the **Project** or **Organization** level — then click **Validate**.
6. Add a permission set to the rule:
   - Click **Bare Metal** in the products list.
   - Select `DediboxConsoleFullAccess`.
7. Click **Validate** to confirm.
8. Optionally, add a condition using CEL (Common Expression Language).
9. Click **Validate** to confirm, then click **Create policy**.

### Attach the policy

You can attach the policy to:
- A **group**, or
- A **user** directly.

#### Attach to a group

1. In the IAM section, select **Groups**.
2. Open the desired group.
3. Select the **Policies** tab.
4. Click **Attach Policy**, then choose:
   - **Select an unassigned policy** to assign the policy exclusively to the group, or
   - **Duplicate an existing policy** to create a copy for the group.
5. Select your previously created policy from the drop-down list and click **Validate**.
6. Ensure the user is a member of this group.

#### Attach to a user

1. In the IAM section, select **Users**.
2. Open the user.
3. Click the **Groups & Policies** tab.
4. Scroll to the **Policies** section and click **Attach Policy**, then choose:
   - **Select an unassigned policy** to assign the policy exclusively to the user, or
   - **Duplicate an existing policy** to create a copy for the user.
5. Select your previously created policy from the drop-down list and click **Validate**.

### Verify access

The user can now access the Dedibox Console.

1. Log in as the user (or ask them to log in).
2. Open the **Dedibox Console**: [https://console.online.net/](https://console.online.net/)

If permissions are correctly configured, the Dedibox resources will be visible.
