You can monitor the activity of your Serverless Jobs using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) to check the current status, RAM, and CPU consumption of your runs. Also, Serverless Jobs is fully integrated into Scalewayâ€™s Observability [Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/quickstart/) and allows you to quickly access your logs.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a Serverless Job](/serverless/jobs/how-to/create-job-from-scaleway-registry/)
- Retrieved your [Grafana credentials](/observability/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/) with Scaleway Observability Cockpit

## How to monitor your Serverless Jobs from the Scaleway console

Scaleway Cockpit allows you to monitor your applications and their infrastructure by giving you access to metrics, logs, and traces in Grafana dashboards. 

Make sure that you have created a Grafana user and [retrieved their username and password](/observability/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/).
