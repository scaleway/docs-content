## How to use Web Deploy to publish a website to Scaleway's Windows Server VMs

This guide explains how to publish a web application to a Scaleway Instance with Windows Server using the following tools:
- [IIS](https://iis.net/), which is the default web server developed by Microsoft for hosting web applications on Windows.
- [Web Deploy](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/web-deploy), a single-click remote deployment technology for IIS.

Throughout this guide, you will learn how to:
- Configure the Windows Server Instance with Web Deploy;
- Set up a website in IIS;
- Publish an application directly from Visual Studio.

<Requirements />
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) running Windows Server or Windows Server Core

<Message type ="note">
  The Windows Server Instance must have an [IPV4 address attached](/instances/concepts/#dynamic-ip).

## Configuring Windows Server to accept Web Deploy

In Windows Server, IIS and its remote management components are not installed by default and need to be added as features. Web Deploy, a tool for deploying web applications, is distributed separately by Microsoft. Here is how to set up your Windows Server to accept Web Deploy:

1. [Connect](/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/) to your Windows Server Instance and open a PowerShell prompt.

2. Install the necessary IIS features and management tools:
  ```powershell
  Install-WindowsFeature Web-Server, Web-WebServer, Web-Mgmt-Tools, Web-Mgmt-Service
  ```

3. Download and run the Web Deploy installer. An up-to-date, direct download link can be found at https://aka.ms/webdeploydownload:
  ```powershell
  Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://download.microsoft.com/download/b/d/8/bd882ec4-12e0-481a-9b32-0fae8e3c0b78/webdeploy_amd64_en-US.msi" -OutFile webdeploy.msi
  Start-Process msiexec.exe -ArgumentList '/i webdeploy.msi'
  ```

4. Follow the installation wizard launched by the previous command. When prompted, select the *Complete* installation.

5. Start the Web Management Service for IIS:
  ```powershell
  Start-Service WMSVC
  ```

## Creating the website configuration in IIS

The Instance is now ready to accept Web Deploy connections. You will create a configuration for a new website in IIS to use as a Web Deploy target. In this guide, the website is named *MyApplication*.

1. Create a directory for the website:
```powershell
mkdir "C:\inetpub\wwwroot\MyApplication"
```

2. Create a new website in IIS with the specified name and path:
```powershell
New-Website -Name "MyApplication" -PhysicalPath "C:\inetpub\wwwroot\MyApplication"
```

3. Remove port bindings of the default website and create a new binding for the MyApplication website on port 80:
```powershell
Remove-WebBinding "Default Web Site"
New-WebBinding -Name "MyApplication" -IPAddress "*" -Port 80 -HostHeader ""
```

4. Start the newly created website:
```powershell
Start-Website -Name "MyApplication"
```

## Publishing from Visual Studio

1. Open or create a web project in Visual Studio.
2. Right-click the solution and select **Publish**.
3. Choose **Web Server (IIS)** and click **Next**.
4. Select **Web Deploy** and click **Next**.
5. Set up the publish profile:
   - Server: `<Your_Instance_IP>:8172`
   - Site name: MyApplication
   - Destination URL: `<Your_Instance_IP>`
   - User name: Administrator
   - Password: (Use the password retrieved earlier)
   <Lightbox image={image} alt="A screenshot of the Web Deploy profile configuration in Visual Studio" size="medium" />
6. Click **Finish** to create the profile.
7. Click **Publish** to deploy your website.

## Accessing your website

Open a web browser and navigate to your server's IP address. Your website should now be live.

   Depending on your website technology, you may need to install additional runtime components on the Windows Server instance, such as the [.NET hosting bundle](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet).
