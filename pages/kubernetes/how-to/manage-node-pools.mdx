This documentation provides step-by-step instructions on how to manage Kubernetes Kapsule node pools

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created a [Kubernetes Kapsule cluster](/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/)

## How to create a new Kubernetes Kapsule node pool

<Message type="tip">
  Kubernetes Kapsule supports using both **fully isolated** and **controlled isolation** node pools within the same cluster.
</Message>

1. Navigate to **Kubernetes** under the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The Kubernetes dashboard displays.
2. Click the Kapsule cluster name you want to manage. The cluster information page displays.
3. Click the **Pools** tab to display the pool configuration of the cluster.
4. Click **Add pool** to launch the pool creation wizard.
5. Configure the pool:
    - Choose the **Availability Zone** for the pool.
    - Choose the commercial type of Instance for the pool.
    - Configure the system volume.
    - Configure pool options.
    - Enter the pool's details.
6. Click **Add pool**. The pool gets added to your basket. Repeat the steps above to configure additional pools.
7. Click **Review** once you have configured the desired pools. A summary of your configuration displays.
8. Verify your configuration and click **Submit** to add the pool(s) to your Kapsule cluster.

## How to edit an existing Kubernetes Kapsule node pool

1. Navigate to **Kubernetes** under the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The Kubernetes dashboard displays.
2. Click the Kapsule cluster name you want to manage. The cluster information page displays.
3. Click the **Pools** tab to display the pool configuration of the cluster.
4. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Delete** next to the node pool you want to edit.
5. Configure the pool:
    - Update pool tags
    - Configure autoscaling
    - Enable or disable the [autoheal feature](/kubernetes/concepts/#autoheal)
6. Click **Update pool** to update the pool configuration.

## How to migrate existing workloads to a new Kubernets Kapsule node pool

<Message type="important">
  Always ensure that your **data is backed up** before performing any operations that could affect it.
</Message>

1. Create the new node pool with the desired configuration either [from the console](/kubernetes/how-to/create-node-pool/) or by using `kubectl`.
    <Message type="tip">
      Ensure that the new node pool is properly labeled if necessary.
    </Message>
2. Run `kubectl get nodes` to check that the new nodes are in a `Ready` state.
3. Cordon the nodes in the old node pool to prevent new pods from being scheduled there. For each node, run: `kubectl cordon <node-name>`
4. Drain the nodes to evict the pods gracefully.
   - For each node, run: `kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data`
   - The `--ignore-daemonsets` flag is used because daemon sets manage pods across all nodes and will automatically reschedule them.
   - The `--delete-emptydir-data` flag is necessary if your pods use emptyDir volumes, but use this option carefully as it will delete the data stored in these volumes.
   - Refer to the [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/safely-drain-node/) for further information.
5. Run `kubectl get pods -o wide` after draining, to verify that the pods have been rescheduled to the new node pool.
6. [Delete the old node pool](#how-to-delete-an-existing-kubernetes-kapsule-node-pool) once you confirm that all workloads are running smoothly on the new node pool.

## How to delete an existing Kubernetes Kapsule node pool

1. Navigate to **Kubernetes** under the **Containers** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The Kubernetes dashboard displays.
2. Click the Kapsule cluster name you want to manage. The cluster information page displays.
3. Click the **Pools** tab to display the pool configuration of the cluster.
4. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Delete** next to the node pool you want to delete.
5. Click **Delete pool** in the pop-up to confirm deletion of the pool.
    <Message type="important">
      This action will permanently destroy your pool and all its data.
