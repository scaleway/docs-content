This page shows you how to manually stop a Serverless Job from the Scaleway console.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [job currently running](/serverless/jobs/how-to/run-job/)

1. Click **Jobs** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The Serverless Jobs page displays.

2. Click the name of the job you want to stop. The job **Overview** tab displays.

3. From the **Job runs** section, click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the job you want to stop, and select **Stop job** from the drop-down menu.

The status of your job changes to `canceled`.

<Message type="note">
  A stopped job cannot be resumed.
