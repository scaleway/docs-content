Formerly named Private Networks, VPC allows you to secure quickly and seamlessly all the resources of your application's architecture from external networks. Additionally, your infrastructure will benefit from improved resiliency as VPC is now regionalized across the AZs by default.
- By default, each region will have at least one VPC, and you can create more if needed
- Each VPC can have multiple Private Networks, each with its own distinct CIDR blocks
- VPC will now include a DHCP server for each Private Network
