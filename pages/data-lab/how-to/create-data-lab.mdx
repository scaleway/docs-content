Data Lab for Apache Spark™ is a product designed to assist data scientists and data engineers in performing calculations on a remotely managed Apache Spark infrastructure.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
- Created a [Private Network](/vpc/how-to/create-private-network/)

1. Click **Data Lab** under **Data & Analytics** on the side menu. The Data Lab for Apache Spark™ page displays.

2. Click **Create Data Lab cluster**. The creation wizard displays.

3. Choose an Apache Spark version from the drop-down menu.

4. Choose a main node type. If you plan to add a notebook to your cluster, select the **DDL-PLAY2-MICRO** configuration to provision sufficient resources for it.

5. Choose a worker node type depending on your hardware requirements.

6. Enter the desired number of worker nodes.

7. Add a [persistent volume](/data-lab/concepts/#persistent-volume) if required, then enter a volume size according to your needs.

    <Message type="note">
    Persistent volume usage depends on your workload, and only the actual usage will be billed, within the limit defined. A minimum of 1 GB is required to run the notebook.
    </Message>

8. Add a notebook if you want to use an integrated notebook environment to interact with your cluster. Adding a notebook requires 1 GB of billable storage. 

9. Select a Private Network from the drop-down menu to attach to your cluster, or create a new one. Data Lab clusters cannot be used without a Private Network.

10. Enter a name for your Data Lab cluster, and add an optional description and/or tags.

11. Verify the estimated cost.

12. Click **Create Data Lab cluster** to finish. You are directed to the Data Lab cluster overview page.
