**Commitment plan for Apple silicon** is a flexible pricing option that allows you to choose between a fully flexible pay-as-you-go pricing or a long-term monthly commitment period for Apple silicon servers.
By committing to a plan, you can enjoy better rates than pay-as-you-go pricing.

The initial commitment is for one month from the server order. At the end of your initial commitment period, the commitment is automatically renewed every month on the anniversary date unless you choose to delete the machine, in which case the deletion will take effect on the anniversary date of the commitment.

It is important to note that the commitment applies only to the server. Options, such as the VPC option, remain without commitment but benefit from lower prices when used with a committed server.
