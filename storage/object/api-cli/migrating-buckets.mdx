<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your API keys](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
  - You have [created an Object Storage bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/)
</Message>

1. Create a new bucket.
    ```
    aws s3api create-bucket --bucket BUCKET-TARGET
    ```
2. Copy the objects between the S3 buckets.
    <Message type="important">
      If you have objects in the Scaleway `Glacier` storage class you must [restore](/storage/object/how-to/restore-an-object-from-glacier/) them before continuing.
    </Message>

    ```
    aws s3 sync s3://BUCKET-SOURCE  s3://BUCKET-TARGET
    ```
3. Check that the content of the copied objects matches the content of the source ones.
    ```
    aws s3 ls --recursive s3://BUCKET-SOURCE --summarize > bucket-contents-source.txt

    aws s3 ls --recursive s3://BUCKET-TARGET --summarize > bucket-contents-target.txt
    ```
4. Compare objects that are in the source and target buckets by using the outputs that are saved to files in the AWS CLI directory. See the following example output:
    ```
    aws s3 ls --recursive s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET --summarize
    ```
    **Sample output:**
    ```
    2022-01-20 11:20:49      multiaz.png

      Total Objects: 1        Total Size: 18640
    ```
5. Update any existing applications or workloads so that they can use the target bucket name, and delete the source bucket.
    <Message type="important">
      Delete the old bucket once everything is copied to avoid additional charges. You can use the following command: `aws s3 rb s3://$bucket-source --force`
