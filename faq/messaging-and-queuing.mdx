## What is NATS, Queues and Topics and Events?

These are three distinct managed message broker tools offered by Scaleway, based on the NATS, SQS and SNS protocols respectively. Previously, these products were grouped together as 'Messaging and Queuing', but have now become three separate products in their own right.

## What are NATS, SNS and SQS?

NATS, SNS and SQS are all messaging protocols used by the Scaleway NATS, Queues, and Topics and Events products. You can find out more about these protocols, and other essential concepts, on our dedicated [concepts page](/serverless/messaging/concepts/).

## Is the Scaleway Queues gateway compatible with my application, framework or tool?

We currently implement the API endpoints listed [here](/serverless/messaging/reference-content/sqs-support/), which makes Scaleway Queues compatible with the AWS SDK as well as many other tools and frameworks including KEDA and Symfony. Note that you need to specify both Regions and URL to ensure compatibility.

## Does Scaleway Topics and Events support all SNS features?

The following subscriber types are supported:
- HTTP/S clients
- Serverless Functions and Containers
- Scaleway Queues queues

For more details on supported and unsupported Topics and Events features, see our [dedicated page](/serverless/messaging/reference-content/sns-support/).

## Can I configure Scalewat NATS via Terraform?

Yes, check out our [tutorial](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/scaleway/scaleway/latest/docs/guides/mnq_with_nats_terraform_provider) on how to configure with the Terraform [NATS Jetstream provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/nats-io/jetstream/latest/docs).

## How are NATS, Queues, and Topics and Events billed?

Billing is based on:

- For NATS: [Stream volume](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#stream-volume) (the total sum of each message's size going through the stream) and [stream persistence](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#stream-persistence) (the total amount of data stored * duration)
<<<<<<< HEAD
- For SQS: [Queue volume](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#queue-volume) (the total sum of each message's size going through the queue)
- For SNS: [Topic Volume](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#queue-volume)(the total sum of each message's size going out from the topic to the subscriptions)
=======
- For Queues: [Queue volume](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#queue-volume) (the total sum of each message's size going through the queue)
- For Topics and Events : [Topic Volume](/serverless/messaging/concepts/#queue-volume)(the total sum of each message's size going out from the topic to the subscriptions)
