Discover how you can deploy your personal cloud storage with the [Nextcloud](https://www.nextcloud.com) InstantApp in seconds. Nextcloud allows you to create a self-hosted cloud storage to host files, folders, contacts, photo galleries, calendars and more on your instance.

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your SSH Key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key)

</Message>

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Instance creation page displays.

2. Click **Create an Instance**. The Instance creation wizard displays.

  You can choose the **NextCloud** image in the **InstantApps** tab:

3. Follow the remaining steps to [create your Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/).

## Opening the mail ports to send e-mails

To avoid spam, remote mail ports cannot be reached from our infrastructure by default. As NextCloud requires sending mail, we need to open the ports. Your account needs to be validated to perform this operation. To get your account reviewed, please [contact our assistance](https://console.scaleway.com/support/).

1. Click the **Security Groups** tab in the Instances overview page.

2. Click **Create a new Security Group** and input the security group name and description.

3. Check the **Enable SMTP** box to unblock the mail ports.

4. Return to the overview tab and select the security group you created in step 2.

The new Security Group configuration will be applied automatically on Virtual Cloud Instances.

## Configuring Nextcloud

When your server is running, you can see the server's IP address in the server list on the control panel.

1. Copy the IP address and open a [SSH session](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance) to find the database credentials required for NextCloud.

  The MySQL password is shown in the MOTD message that is shown upon your first connection to the server:

2. Open a web browser and enter: `http://YOUR.CLOUD.SERVER.IP/nextcloudcloud` (For example if your servers ip is `212.47.0.0` it will be `http://212.47.0.0/nextcloud`).

  The installation script prompts for a username and password as well as the database credentials.

3. Fill in the required information and press on **Enter** finalize the installation:

  The installation takes a few seconds to complete.

## Log in to Nextcloud

Once the installation is finished you are redirected to the login page.

Enter the username and password you set previously and press **Enter** on your keyboard:

You are now connected to your personal cloud storage and can start using it!
