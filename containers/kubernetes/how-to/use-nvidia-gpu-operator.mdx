A new Kubernetes operator provided by NVIDIA to support all GPU pools is being introduced on Kubernetes Kapsule and Kosmos.
This operator is compatible with both [RENDER-S](https://www.scaleway.com/en/gpu-instances/) and [GPU-3070-S](https://www.scaleway.com/en/gpu-3070-instances/) offers.

The GPU operator is available for all newly created GPU pools and provides automated installation of all required software on GPU worker nodes, such as the device plugin, container toolkit, GPU drivers etc. For more information, refer to [the GPU operator overview](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/overview.html)

## How to get the GPU operator for a new pool?

Scaleway uses Helm to automate the deployment of the GPU operator in your GPU node pools. It is installed by default on all new GPU pools.

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the Containers section of the side menu. The Kubernetes creation page displays.
2. Select the cluster you want to add a pool to.
3. Click the **Pools** tab.
4. Click the **+ Add pool** button. The pool creation wizard displays.
5. (*optional*) If you are using a Kosmos cluster, choose a **pool type**. Select a Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule pool.
6. Choose the zone in which your pool will be deployed.
7. Click the **GPU** tab and select the GPU Instance you want to add. Currently both RENDER-S and GPU-3070-S Instances are supported by the operator.
8. Configure the pool options for your pool.
9. Click **Add pool** to deploy the pool. The GPU operator displays in the Easy Deploy tab of your pool as well as in your `kube-system` namespace.

## How to activate the GPU operator on existing node pools

Replace the existing nodes of your pool to deploy the GPU operator on your existing pools.

## How to edit the configuration of the GPU operator

The GPU operator on your Scaleway node pools is fully configurable, either through the Easy Deploy feature, directly from the Scaleway console, or by using `helm`.

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the Containers section of the side menu. The Kubernetes creation page displays.
2. Select the cluster you want to configure.
3. Click the **Easy Deploy** tab.
4. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Edit** next to the GPU operator deployment. A pop-up displays.
5. Edit the YAML configuration of the deployment to match your desired configuration.
    <Message type="tip">
        Refer to the [offical NVIDIA documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/getting-started.html#chart-customization-options) for a list of available Helm configuration options.

6. Click **Update and deploy** to update and deploy the configuration of the GPU operator.
