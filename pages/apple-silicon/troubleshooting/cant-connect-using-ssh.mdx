import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'


<Requirements />
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- A [Mac mini](/apple-silicon/how-to/create-mac-mini/)

## Problem
You are unable to connect to your Scaleway Mac mini via SSH.

### Symptoms
- SSH connection attempts fail.
- "Permission denied" or "Connection refused" errors appear.
- Timeouts occur when trying to establish an SSH connection.

### Possible causes
- The SSH key was not uploaded during the Mac mini setup.
- Your IP has been blacklisted due to multiple failed authentication attempts.
- The Mac mini requires a reboot to apply SSH key changes.

### Solution

#### Verify your SSH key
Ensure your SSH key is correctly configured before attempting to connect:
- Follow the instructions to [generate and upload an SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/).

#### Check for connection blacklisting
Repeated failed login attempts can trigger Scaleway’s security mechanisms, blocking your connection. To resolve this:
- [Reboot](/apple-silicon/how-to/reboot-mac-mini/) your Mac mini to reset the `fail2ban` security measures.
    A reboot ensures your SSH key is applied correctly and clears blacklisted IPs.
    1. Log in to the [Scaleway console](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elements).
    2. Click **Apple silicon** in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu.
    3. Select your Mac mini from the list.
    4. Scroll down to the **Reboot Mac mini** section and click **Reboot**.
    5. Confirm the reboot.

    <Message type="note">
    The reboot **must** be carried out via the Scaleway console, and not via any other method, in order to resolve the problem.
    </Message>

#### Attempt SSH connection again
After the reboot, attempt to reconnect using:
```sh
ssh -i /path/to/your/private_key user@<server_ip>
```
Replace `/path/to/your/private_key` with your actual private key location and `<server_ip>` with your Mac mini’s IP address.

## Further troubleshooting
 If the issue persists, contact [Scaleway's support](https://account.scaleway.com/?service=elementssupport) for assistance.
