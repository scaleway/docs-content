Following our deprecation notice, it is no longer possible to create and use SNI routes with HTTP backends in Scaleway Load Balancer. The HTTP Host header route type must now be used instead.

All Load Balancers that were still using SNI routes with HTTP backends on June 1st have now been automatically updated to use the HTTP Host header route instead.

For more information please refer to our documentation: https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/network/load-balancer/reference-content/sni-route-deprecation/
