VPC allows you to build your own **V**irtual **P**rivate **C**loud on top of Scaleway's shared public cloud. Within each VPC, you can create **Private Networks** and attach Scaleway resources to them, as long as the resources are in an AZ within the network's region. Attached resources can then communicate between themselves in isolated and secured networks, away from the public internet. The [routing](/network/vpc/concepts/#routing) feature allows the different Private Networks of a VPC to communicate with each other. More features and resources will be coming to the VPC product in the future.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to identify your default VPCs

One default VPC per region is automatically created per Scaleway [Project](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project).

Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the Scaleway console side menu. Your VPC [dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/vpc/vpc) displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-default-vpc.webp" alt="" />

You see three default VPCs (each with a **DEFAULT** badge next to it), one for each of the following regions:

- Paris `PAR`
- Amsterdam `AMS`
- Warsaw `WAW`

Each of these VPCs is named `default` (though you can [edit](#how-to-edit-a-vpc's-name-and-tags) the name if you wish). Any new Private Networks that you create will be added to the default VPC for their region, unless you override this by specifying a different VPC.

It is currently not possible to change the default VPC for a region.

## How to create a VPC

If you want to create more VPCs beyond the default ones created for you, you can do so via the following steps:

1. Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the Scaleway console side menu.

2. Click the <Icon name="plus" /> button. The VPC creation wizard displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-vpc.webp" alt="" />

3. Choose a **region** in which to create your VPC.

4. Enter a **name** for your VPC (or use the wand icon to generate a random name). Optionally, you can also add **tags** to help organize your VPCs. Each tag should be separated by a space.

5. Enter a name for the **Private Network** that will be automatically created in this new VPC. Alternatively, click the wand icon to generate a name automatically.

    <Message type="note">
    You can create more Private Networks in this VPC after creation, if you wish. However, you can not move an existing Private Network from one VPC to another.
    </Message>

6. Click **Create VPC** to finish.

    Your VPC is created, and you are redirected to its **Overview** page.

## How to edit a VPC's name and tags

1. Click **VPC** in the **Network** section of the Scaleway console side menu. A list of your VPCs displays.

2. Click the VPC you want to edit. The VPC's **Private Networks** dashboard displays.

3. Click the **Overview** tab.

4. Make the following edits as required:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-vpc-overview.webp" alt="" />

    - Hover your mouse over the VPC's name at the top of the page, and click the <Icon name="edit" /> icon that displays. Edit the name as required, and click <Icon name="validate" /> when you're done.
    - Click into the box marked **Tags** and start typing. Hit the spacebar to create the tag. Click the **X** next to any tag to delete it.

It is currently not possible to change the default VPC for a region.
