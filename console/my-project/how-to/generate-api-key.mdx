<Message type="iam">
  If you have [activated IAM](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/activate-iam), the actions described on this page are outdated. 
  Refer to the [How to manage API keys](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/manage-api-keys/) documentation page for the equivalent procedure with IAM.

[API keys](/console/my-account/concepts/#api-key) are unique identifiers associated with your Scaleway projects and consist of an [access key](/console/my-account/concepts/#access-key) and a [secret key](/console/my-account/concepts/#secret-key). They allow you to use the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/). 

Each Scaleway [Project](/console/my-account/concepts/#project) can have several API keys, to give multiple accesses to the same Project. API keys are like passwords, they allow total access to your account - do not share them! If you ever think your API key might be compromised, delete it and create a new one.

Creating an API key can be done directly from the Scaleway console:

1. From the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com), navigate to the [Credentials](/console/my-account/concepts/#credentials) tab of your Project Dashboard:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-credentials-nav.webp" alt="" />
2. Scroll down to the **API Key** section:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-api-keys.webp" alt="" />
3. Click **Generate new API key**. The following pop-up appears:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-api-key-purpose.webp" alt="" />
4. Add an **API Key purpose** (for your own reference), or leave this blank. Then click **Generate API Key**.

    The two parts of your API Key (access key and secret key) are displayed. Take careful note of the secret key, as it will not be recoverable or viewable after this point.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-generate-api-key.webp" alt="" />
5. Click **OK** to conclude.
