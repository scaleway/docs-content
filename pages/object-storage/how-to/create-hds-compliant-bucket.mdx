// TO REWRITE

The French Public Health Code (Article L.1111-8) requires that service providers which host certain types of personal health information (PHI) receive HDS (Hébergeur de Données de Santé) certification. Introduced by the French governmental agency for health, ASIP Santé (Agence Française de la Santé Numérique), HDS provides a framework to strengthen the security and protection of PHI.

The Hébergeurs de Données de Santé (HDS) certification is required for entities such as cloud service providers that host the personal health data governed by French laws and collected for delivering preventive, diagnostic, and other health services. The HDS regulation was issued by ASIP SANTÉ which, under the French Ministry of Health, is responsible for promoting electronically based healthcare solutions in France.

Object Storage allows you to store different types of objects (documents, images, videos, etc.) and distribute them instantly, anywhere in the world.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

To get started with Object Storage, you must first create a bucket. Objects are gathered into buckets. Each bucket represents a space where objects are stored.

1. Click **Object Storage** on the left side menu of the console. The Object Storage dashboard displays.
2. Click **+ Create bucket**. The bucket creation page displays.
3. Select the [region](/object-storage/concepts/#region-and-availability-zone) in which to create your bucket:
    - Amsterdam, The Netherlands:
      - Region: `nl-ams`
    - Paris, France:
      - Region: `fr-par`
    - Warsaw, Poland:
      - Region: `pl-waw`
4. Check **Public** or **Private** to define the bucket visibility. The bucket visibility specifies whether everyone can see the list of objects in the bucket. It does not affect [object visibility](/object-storage/concepts/#visibility).
    <Message type="note">
      A file uploaded to a public bucket is private by default.
      A private file stored in a public bucket is not publicly accessible.
      You can change the bucket visibility at any time from the **Bucket settings** tab.
    </Message>
5. Select a use case for your bucket.
6. Enable [bucket versioning](/object-storage/how-to/use-bucket-versioning/) if you want to store multiple versions of your objects (this may lead to higher storage costs).
7. If applicable, you can tick the **Activate 90-day free trial** to benefit from 750 GB of free [Multi-AZ class storage](/object-storage/faq/#what-are-the-object-storage-classes-offered-by-scaleway) for buckets in your Organization, across all regions. Refer to our [dedicated FAQ](/object-storage/faq/#how-can-i-benefit-from-the-object-storage-free-trial) for more information.
8. Enter a name for your bucket.
9. Optionally, you can use the cost estimator to simulate your Object Storage costs.
10. Click **Create bucket** to confirm. A list of your buckets displays, showing the newly created bucket.

You can find more information about your bucket by clicking on its name in the **Buckets** list, and then on the **Bucket settings** tab.
