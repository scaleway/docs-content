Created by [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/), InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a decentralized protocol used to store and share content.

Scaleway IPFS Naming allows you to create a key to point to your latest update, and above all maintain this information on the IPFS network and share it through Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs), giving you an extra layer of performance in the region of your choice. This way your records remain available and accessible, even when your local machine is offline.

In this quickstart, we will show you how to create and import an IPNS key and update your records using Scaleway IPFS Naming.

## Scaleway Command Line Interface overview

The [Scaleway Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/) allows you to create and interact with your names. You will be able to create names, manage them, and add/delete value within them.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
- [Installed and configured the Scaleway CLI](/developer-tools/scaleway-cli/quickstart/)

## Creating a name

This operation creates a new key. A [key](/labs/ipfs-naming/concepts/#name), which will be associated with a value to create a record.

Type the following command to create your key using the CLI.

```
scw ipns name create name=my-website value=QmULjVfvvMf3v637XLQuBoYqchFC5MCPYLJmVeTMVcACK2
```

You should get a response like the following, providing details about your newly created name.

```
NameID $NAME_ID
ProjectID 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
Region fr-par
Key -
CreatedAt now
UpdatedAt now
Name my-website
Status queued
Value QmULjVfvvMf3v637XLQuBoYqchFC5MCPYLJmVeTMVcACK2
```

Alternatively, you can also run the following API command. Make sure you replace the values with your own, using the API configuration table below.

```
curl -X POST \
 -H "X-Auth-Token: $SECRET_KEY" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 "https://api.scaleway.com/ipfs/v1alpha1/regions/$REGION_ID/names" \
 -d '{
   "project_id": "$PROJECT_ID",
   "name": "my-website",
   "value": "QmULjVfvvMf3v637XLQuBoYqchFC5MCPYLJmVeTMVcACK2"
 }'
```

| Parameter     | Description |
| :------------ |:----------- |
| `$SECRET_KEY` | The secret part of your [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#api-key)   |
| `$REGION_ID`  | Create a name in this given region. Possible values are `fr-par`, `pl-waw` and `nl-ams`. Default value is `fr-par`. |
| `$PROJECT_ID` | ID of the Project you want to create your key in. Your Project name can only contain alphanumeric characters, spaces, dots, and dashes. To find your Project ID, you can consult the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/organization/) |
| `name`        | Create a key with this given name. |
| `value`       | Assign specific value to your records. |

## Import a key
