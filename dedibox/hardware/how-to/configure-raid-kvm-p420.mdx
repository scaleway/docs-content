The personalized RAID configuration allows you to create a RAID mode that cannot be created via the management console of Online.net (RAID10, for example).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- A [Dedibox dedicated server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/) with an HP Smart Array P420 RAID controller

1. Click **Server** > **Server list** to display the list of your servers. Click the identifier of the server you want to configure. The server information page displays.
2. Click **iLO** in the menu on the right and validate the terms. Then enter your connection's IP address and click **CREATE**. Your iDRAC session credentials display. Login to iDRAC using the credentials shown.
3. The iDRAC dashboard displays. Click **Launch** in the **Virtual Console Preview** section to launch the Java-based KVM-over-IP applet. Once the server's screen output is visible in the KVM applet, reboot the machine.
    <Message type="tip">
      Set your Java security settings to **low** to avoid connection problems.

4. Press **F8** during the boot process to enter the RAID configuration utility:

5. Select the RAID controller from the drop-down menu. The current array configuration displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_p420_03.webp" alt="" />
6. Click **Delete** to delete the existing virtual disk. A pop-up displays. Click **OK** to confirm deletion of the logical drive:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_p420_04.webp" alt="" />

    <Message type="important">
      Deleting your logical drive will erase all data stored on it.
    </Message>
7. Create a new logical array once the previous one is deleted. To do so, click **Create Array**:

8. Select the physical disks you want to use for the virtual device and confirm by clicking **OK**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_p420_07.webp" alt="" />
9. Select the parameters for the array and click **Save** to write the changes to the disks:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway_p420_08.webp" alt="" />
10. Click **Exit ACU** to quit the array configuration and reboot your server.
