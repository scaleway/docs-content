A Scaleway coupon code provides you with a discount or credits to use on our services. You can receive it as part of a promotional campaign or from your account manager. To redeem a coupon code, you need to [create a Scaleway account](/console/my-account/how-to/create-an-account/).

Coupon codes are unique and valid only for a defined period of time only.
