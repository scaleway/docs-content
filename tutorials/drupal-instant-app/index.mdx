Drupal is an open source content managment platform. Drupal helps you build everything from personal blogs to enterprise applications.

## Create and start a new instance using the Drupal InstantApp

Follow the instructions for [creating an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance). When selecting the **image** to run on the Instance, ensure that you choose the **Drupal** image in the **InstantApps** tab.

## Open the mail ports to send e-mail

To avoid spam, remote mail ports cannot be reached from our infrastructure by default. As Discourse requires to send mail, we need to open them. Your account needs to be validated to perform this operation. To get your account reviewed, please [contact our assistance](https://console.scaleway.com/support/).

Click the **Security Groups** tab to enter the security-groups page.
Click the **Create a new Security Group** button and input the security group name and description.
Check the **Enable SMTP** box to unblock the mail ports.

Go back to your servers details end select the security group previously created.
The new Security Group configuration will be applied automatically on Virtual Cloud Instances. BareMetal Cloud Instances need to be hard rebooted from the management console to configure the new rules.

## Finalize Drupal install

To finalize the Drupal installation copy your server public IP address and paste it in your favorite browser.

You land on the Drupal installation wizard.

During the installation, you will be asked for the database login, password and database name.
You can retrieve the database `login` and `password` on the message of the day (MOTD) when you connect your server or on the README file at `/root/README`

To make Drupal use your database, set "Database name" to `drupal` and "Database username" to `root`. You can retrieve the database password on the message of the day (MOTD) when you connect on your server ; or in the README file at located at /root/README. In my case, the password is `a9975ce21d969e0564c07f4313a57fa7253fc6df`.

Configure your profile completing `email`, `username`, `password`, `sitename` and click the "Save and continue" button.
