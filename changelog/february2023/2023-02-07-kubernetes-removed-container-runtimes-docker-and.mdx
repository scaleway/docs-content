All new pools created in Scaleway Kubernetes clusters now use `Containerd` as their default runtime. 

We recommend you [migrate node pools](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/change-container-runtime-interface/) to a supported CRI. You can find more details about migration policies in our [version support policy page](/containers/kubernetes/reference-content/version-support-policy/).
