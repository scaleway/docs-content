  This documentation concerns rescue mode for [Dedibox servers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/). To use rescue mode on [Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/) refer to the corresponding [documentation](/compute/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes/#how-to-use-rescue-mode).

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your SSH key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key)
  - You have performed the [linking process](/bare-metal/dedibox/how-to/link-dedibox-account/) between Dedibox and Scaleway
  - You have [ordered](/bare-metal/dedibox/how-to/order-dedibox) and [installed](/bare-metal/dedibox/how-to/install-dedibox) a Dedibox server

Rescue mode allows you to boot a [Dedibox server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/) from the network. It downloads a rescue operating system, that runs completely in the RAM of the server. This allows you to perform maintenance and data recovery operations, even if the machine is not reachable in normal mode.

1. Click **Dedibox** in the **Bare Metal** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Dedibox dashboard displays.
2. Choose the server you want to reboot into rescue mode from the list. Click its name to display that server's information page.
3. Scroll down to the **Rescue Mode** section.
4. Click **Boot in rescue mode.** A pop-up displays.
5. Select the rescue operating system that fits your server's operating system and click **Boot in rescue mode**.

    The server starts to reboot into rescue mode. 

    <Message type="note">
      Depending on the hardware model of the machine, the reboot may take several minutes.
    </Message>
5. Once rebooted, use a terminal application to log into the machine using SSH with the user account `root`:
    ```bash
    ssh rescue-user@<dedibox>
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      Rescue mode uses the SSH keys registered for your Dedibox server as an authentication method. If you have lost your private key, you can access your server using the credentials displayed in the console:

    </Message>

You are now logged into rescue mode and able to perform maintenance actions on the machine.

<Message type="tip">
  Rescue mode runs completely in the RAM of the server. To access files located on the hard disk, it needs to be mounted. The disk can be mounted automatically by running `mountall.sh`
</Message>

## How to reboot into normal mode

Once the maintenance of the machine is completed, it can be rebooted back into the operating system installed on the hard disk of the server.

To reboot the server into normal mode, click **Switch to normal node** on the server's overview page. The server reboots on the installed system and will be available in normal mode within a few minutes.
