Your RPNv1 gateway may differ from one Dedibox to another for technical reasons.
It is normally pushed by DHCP, and configured automatically. However, in some cases you may need to know the details of the gateway.

You can find the RPNv1 gateway for your Dedibox in the Scaleway console, or by running the following commands.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)
- A [Dedibox dedicated server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox) with an RPN interface

1. Connect to your Dedibox using SSH.
2. Install the `iproute2` package, if not done yet. For Debian and Ubuntu, use the following command to install it:
    ```
    apt install iproute2
    ```
3. Run the `ip route show` command to display your RPNv1 gateway. An output as the following displays:
    ```
    # ip route show
    10.90.0.0/XX via X.X.X.X ...
    ```
    The output contains the following information:
    * `10.90.0.0/XX`: Your RPNv1 IP subnet. The part after the `/` represents the [CIDR netmask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) of your subnet. 
    * `X.X.X.X`: The IP address of the gateway. The gateway is always the first IP of the subnet.

    <Message type="note">
      The gateway does not ping, this is normal behavior.

<Message type="tip">
  If you know your RPN netmask, you can also find your gateway by using `ipcalc`. 
  - Run the following command to calculate the IP address of your RPNv1 gateway:
    ```
    # ipcalc -b [SET_HERE_YOUR_RPN_IP]/[CIDR_NETMASK] | grep HostMin
    HostMin: X.X.X.X
    ```
    The gateway is located at the IP address in place of `X.X.X.X`.
