Scaleway provides 24/7 basic technical support by ticket for free. You can contact the technical assistance directly from your console. You can [upgrade your support level](/console/my-account/how-to/configure-support-plans/) to profit from phone support and a dedicated account manager.

If you have any inquiries and wish to speak to our Support team, you may open a Support ticket by clicking on **Support** in the lower left menu.
