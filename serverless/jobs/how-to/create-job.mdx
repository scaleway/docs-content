This page shows you how to create Serverless Jobs using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/).

You can create a job from the [Scaleway Container Registry](/containers/container-registry/quickstart/), or any other public container registry, such as Docker Hub, AWS Container registries, GitLab container registry, etc.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a Container Registry namespace](/containers/container-registry/how-to/create-namespace/) and [pushed a container image](/containers/container-registry/how-to/push-images/) to it

## Create a job from the Scaleway Container Registry

Scaleway's Serverless Jobs allows you to create jobs from several container [registries](/containers/container-registry/concepts/#registry), including the [Scaleway Container Registry](/containers/container-registry/concepts/#container-registry) which allows you to store, secure and manage all your custom container images effortlessly.

1. Click **Jobs** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The jobs page displays.

2. Click **Create job**. The job creation wizard displays.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Select the **Scaleway** Container Registry.
    - Select the required Container Registry namespace from the drop-down list, and then select the container image and tag.
    - Enter a name or use the automatically generated one. The name can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes.
    - Select the region in which your job will be created.
    - Choose the **resources** to be allocated to your job at runtime. These define the performance characteristics of your job.
    - Add a **cron schedule** in the `* * * * *` format, and select your time zone to run your job periodically. Refer to the [cron schedules documentation](/serverless/jobs/reference-content/cron-schedules/) for more information.
    - Define any **environment variables** you want to inject into your job in the advanced options. For each environment variable, click **+Add new variable** and enter the key/value pair.
        <Message type="note">
        Encode your environment variables to `base64` if they are too large, and contain carriage returns.
        </Message>
    - Add the desired [secret references](/serverless/jobs/how-to/reference-secret-in-job/) to your job.
    - Add a **startup command** to your job. It will be executed every time your job is run.
    - Set a **maximum duration** to your job to stop it automatically if it does not complete within this limit.
    - Verify the **estimated cost**.
4. Click **Create a job definition** to finish. You are directed to the listing of your Serverless Jobs.

5. Click the name of the job you just created. The **Overview** tab displays.

6. Click **Run job** to execute it.

The execution appears in the **Job runs** section of the **Overview** tab.

## Create a job from an external container registry

Scaleway Serverless Jobs allows you to create jobs from external public [container registries](/containers/container-registry/concepts/#registry), such as Docker Hub, AWS container registries, GitLab container registry, etc.

Private external container registries are currently not supported.
