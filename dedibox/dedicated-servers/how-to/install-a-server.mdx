After the delivery of your server, you can begin installing it.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net)
  - You have a [Dedibox server](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/order-a-server)
</Message>

1. From the console, click **Server** > **Server list** on the top menu. A list of your servers displays.
2. Click **Manage** next to the server you want to install. The server install wizard displays.
3. Select the type of operating system you want to install. 
    <Message type="tip">
      For more information about OS types, refer to the [dedicated servers concepts page](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/concepts/#os-type).
    </Message>

    <Message type="note">
      If you wish to complete your installation using [KVM Over IP](/dedibox/kvm-over-ip/), click **Install over KVM** on this page.
    </Message>
4. Choose the operating system, and the OS version. Then, click **Install**. 
5. Personalize the [partitioning](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/concepts/#partioning) configuration:

    You can select the **Filesystem**, **RAID level** and set the **mount point** and **partition size** in MB.

    If the server has two disks, the RAID levels **RAID 0**, **RAID 1** and **No RAID** are proposed. If the server has more than two disks installed, **RAID 5** is also proposed. Set the configuration according to your needs. If a software RAID is configured, ensure the partitioning on all disks of the RAID is identical.

    The following restrictions apply during partitioning:
      - The disks can have a maximum of 4 primary partitions.
      - Do not create a `/var` partition, as the installation will likely fail.
      - The `/` partition must be at least 2048 MB large.
      - Once configured, click **Validate** to confirm the partition layout and to proceed to the next step.

  6. Set a user and eventually administrator password and select SSH keys that will be able to connect to the server. Click **Next Step** once all set.
  7. A configuration summary displays. Confirm the configuration by clicking **Delete all my disks and install the system**. This launches the automatic installation of the server.

    <Message type="important">
      - **This will delete all data present on the disks**. Make sure to have a backup of your data before launching the re-installation of a Scaleway Dedibox to avoid data loss. <br /><br />
      - When you start a CentOS installation with custom partitioning, you must keep about 5 GB of unallocated disk space to prevent the automatic installation system from crashing.
    </Message>
8. Configure the system parameters. You can edit parameters such as the server name, add a username, password and SSH key, and configure monitoring alerts and updates.
    <Message type="note">
      To connect to your server via SSH, it is recommended that you [create and upload your SSH key](/dedibox-console/account/how-to/upload-an-ssh-key/) at this stage so that it can be transferred to your server during installation.
    </Message>
9. Check that all information you entered is correct on the installation summary tab.
    Once the installation completes, your server will reboot on its hard disk.

<Message type="note">
  - Depending on the OS, the installation may take several minutes to complete.
  - Certain operating systems may require additional reboots for completion.
  - We recommend waiting 45 to 60 minutes before connecting to your server.
