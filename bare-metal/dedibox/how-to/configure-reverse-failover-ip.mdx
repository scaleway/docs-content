<Macro id="dedibox-scaleway-migration" />

You can edit the reverse DNS of a failover IP address to a custom value. This can be useful when you want to send emails from your Dedibox, as certain remote mail servers do not accept emails coming from generic reverse hostnames.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Linked](/bare-metal/dedibox/how-to/link-dedibox-account/) your Dedibox and Scaleway accounts
- Ordered a [Dedibox server](/bare-metal/dedibox/how-to/order-dedibox/) and a [failover IP](/bare-metal/dedibox/how-to/order-failover-ip/)

1. Click **Dedibox** in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu.
2. Click the **Failover IPs** tab to display a list of your failover IPs.
3. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the failover IP you want to edit. A drop-down menu displays.
4. Click **Edit reverse**. A pop-up displays.

    <Message type="tip">
      You can click <Icon name="more" /> next to the IP you want to configure in the listing of the failover IPs on the left.
    </Message>
5. Enter a new IPv4 reverse DNS and click **Save changes**.
    <Message type="important">
      Make sure that a valid and corresponding A-Record is set for the reverse DNS you want to configure.
    </Message>

The reverse DNS (PTR-Record) of the failover IP is being updated.
