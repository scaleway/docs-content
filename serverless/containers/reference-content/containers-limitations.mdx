This section contains usage limits that apply when using Serverless Containers.

\* Lower limits may apply before account verification. Contact our support team if you have any questions.

\** Total container memory is the sum of the memory allocated to all your containers at their maximum Scale.

\*** Use [Serverless Jobs](/serverless/jobs/) for longer tasks.

These limits are enforced as [Organization quotas](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/additional-content/organization-quotas/#serverless-containers).

During the execution of the container, if the limits are exceeded, a restart occurs.

## Configuration Restrictions

In order to ensure the proper functioning of the product, we restrict the use of certain ports and environment variables

* Blocked ports:
  * **25**: Due to potential abuse (spam), no outbound traffic is allowed through this port, except from Scaleway Transactional Email SMTP servers.
  * **465**: Due to potential abuse (spam), no outbound traffic is allowed through this port, except from Scaleway Transactional Email SMTP servers.
* Unavailable custom ports
  Do not make your containers listen on these ports which are used by our service.
  * 8008
  * 8012
  * 8013
  * 8022
  * 9090
  * 9091
* Reserved environment variables:
  * `PORT`: Port on which your server should listen to (the default value is 8080)
  * `SCW_*`: Reserved for product configuration (for example: token validation)

## Default values for CPU and memory limits

When container CPU and/or memory are not provided by the client, these default values are automatically used:

| Resources | Default value |
|-----------|---------------|
| CPU       | 140 mvCPU     |
| Memory    | 256 MiB       |

## Architecture

Scaleway Containers only supports `amd64` [architecture](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images#architectures-other-than-amd64/) for
images.

For example, if you build an image using an ARM CPU, such as Apple Silicon, your image will be in the `arm64` architecture, and you will have an error message during deployment.

You must ensure to build your image to target `amd64` architecture.
