The ownCloud application comes with the following packages:

  - `mysql-instance`
  - `ownCloud`
  - `pwgen`

With ownCloud you can sync & share your files, calendar, contacts and more. Access your data from all your devices on an open platform you can extend and modify.

## Deploying ownCloud

1. Click **Create instance** button in the **Compute** section of the control panel.
<Lightbox src="scaleway-nc-create-server.webp" alt="" />

2. Select the ownCloud image in the **InstantApp** section of the Instance creation page.
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-nc-owncloud.webp" alt="" />

3. Click **Create Instance**.

## Configuring ownCloud

Once your Instance is running, you can see the Instance's IP address on the Instance list. 

1. Copy the IP address and paste it on a browser.

You land on the ownCloud configuration page.
<Lightbox src="scaleway-owncloud-installation.webp" alt="" />

2. Add a username and password for the admin account.
   
3. Retrieve the database credentials, as ownCloud uses a MySQL database. To do so, connect your Instance via SSH.

  ```
  ssh root@<your_instance_ip>
  ```

  The MySQL password is shown in the MOTD message that is shown upon your first connection to the Instance:
  
  <Lightbox src="scaleway-owncloud-database.webp" alt="" />

4. Enter the database user and password you retrieve from the MOTD in the ownCloud setup wizard.

5. Set the database name to `owncloud`.

6. Click **Finish Setup**.

## Configuring ownCloud with Object Storage

1. Click **Storage** in the side menu of the console.

2. Click **Create a Bucket** to create a bucket for ownCloud to store files inside.

3. Name your bucket and validate your bucket creation.

4. Click the **Credentials** button in the ownCloud interface.

5. Click your identifier in the top right corner and then on **Settings**.

6. Enter the **Storage** section and click **Enable external Storage**.

7. Choose **Amazon S3** in the Dropdown list and enter your S3 credentials.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-owncloud-configure-s3.webp" alt="" />

    - Folder name
    - Region: `nl-ams`
    - Access Key: your `access key`
    - Secret Key: your `secret_key`
    - Bucket: The name of the bucket you created
    - Hostname: `s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud`

<Message type="important">

Edit the **Region** and **Hostname** parameters to the region of your bucket. It can either be `fr-par` (Paris, France), `nl-ams` (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) or `pl-waw` (Warsaw, Poland).

</Message>

You now have a new folder using Object Storage that allows you to have highly available and unlimited storage.
