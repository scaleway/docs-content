## Problem

The clock of my Serverless Function is slowly drifting.

## Cause

The internal clock of a Serverless Function executed in a [Sandbox v1](/serverless-functions/reference-content/functions-sandbox/) environment is known to slowly drift over time, to reach a clock skew of approximately **two seconds** after 24 hours.

## Solution

[Update the sandbox environment](/serverless-functions/how-to/manage-a-function/) of your Serverless Function to [Sandbox v2](/serverless-functions/reference-content/functions-sandbox/#sandbox-v2) to solve clock drift issues.
