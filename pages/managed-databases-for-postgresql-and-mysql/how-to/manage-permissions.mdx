Permissions define the actions a user can perform on a logical database. A database user is generated automatically when you create your Database Instance and this user is attributed all permissions. However, newly created users have no permissions by default.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A [PostgreSQL or MySQL Database Instance](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/quickstart/)

## Set permissions for an existing user

1. Click **PostgreSQL and MySQL** under **Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.
2. Select the geographical region of the Instance you want to manage from the drop-down.
3. Click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info** to access the Database Instance information page.
4. Go to the **Users** tab. A list of users displays.
5. Click <Icon name="more" /> > **Update permissions** to open the user permissions panel.
6. Select the appropriate permissions for each database.
    <Message type="note">
      Three types of permissions are available:
        - **None:** No access to the database
        - **Read:** Allow users to read tables and fields in a database
        - **Write:** Allow users to write content in databases

    </Message>
7. Click **Update user** to confirm.

## Set permissions for a new user

During user creation, the permissions panel can be accessed through the top tab menu.
For more information, see [how to add users](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/add-users/).

<Message type="note">
  Permissions are applied on existing items **at the moment the configuration is set**, and not applied to any items created afterward.
  When you modify your Database configuration, your configured permissions are automatically set to **Custom**. The **Custom** setting ensures that your permissions are still valid for items created before you reconfigured your Database.
  Any items created after you change your configuration will not have permissions applied to them, you must set new permissions.
