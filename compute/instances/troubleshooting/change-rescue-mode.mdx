The previous Instances rescue mode, which relied on bootscripts, will be discontinued by May 31, 2023. To ensure that your Instances operate correctly, make sure to switch them to either local boot or the new rescue mode before this deadline.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance) using the previous (bootscript-based) rescue mode
  - You have [generated an API key](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) if you want to update rescue mode via the Scaleway API

## Updating rescue mode from the Scaleway console

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu in the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers). The list of your Instances displays.
2. Click the name of the Instance that is using the previous rescue mode. The Instance overview displays.
3. Stop the Instance if it is currently running by using the top right toggle of the Instances overview page.
4. Click the **Advanced Settings** tab.
5. Scroll to the **Boot Mode** section and change the boot mode of your Instance to **local boot**.
6. Power the Instance on again by using the toggle.
    <Message type="tip">
      If you want to utilize rescue mode again, change the boot type back to **rescue mode** to reboot the Instance using the latest rescue mode.

## Updating rescue mode using the Scaleway API

1. [List the Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/#path-instances-list-all-instances) of your Project(s).
2. Filter the returned Instances to keep only the ones with `boot_type: "rescue"`.
3. [Stop the Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/#path-instances-perform-action)
4. [Update the Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/#path-instances-update-an-instance) and set `boot_type: "local"`
  <Message type="tip">
    If you still want to use rescue mode for your Instance(s), update these Instances again and switch back the `boot_type` to “rescue”. They will then use the updated rescue system.
