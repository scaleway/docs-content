## How to create a Public Gateway

1. Click **Public Gateways** in the **Network** section of the side menu.
2. Click **Create Public Gateway** to launch the Public Gateway creation wizard:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-vpc-gw-wiz1.webp" alt="" />
3. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 
    - Choose an **Availability Zone**, which is the geographical location in which your Public Gateway will be created. Note that in order to attach a Public Gateway to a Private Network, they must be in the same Availability Zone.
    - Choose a **Public Gateway Type**, which impacts the pricing and bandwidth of your gateway.
    - Choose an **IP**. You can choose to assign one of your existing flexible IPs to your Public Gateway. Otherwise, a new IP will be automatically assigned here. 
    - Choose a **Name** for your Public Gateway, and (optionally) a description and tags.
    - Verify the **Estimated Cost** of your Public Gateway, based on the specifications you chose.
4. Click **Create Public Gateway** to finish. 

    Your Public Gateway is created and you are redirected to the **Public Gateways** dashboard, where your newly-created Public Gateway now displays.

<Message type="note">
As a temporary measure, when you create a Public Gateway, a new [VPC](/network/vpc/concepts/#vpc) is automatically created for that Public Gateway. This VPC must **not** be deleted, to ensure correct functionality of the gateway. Read our [dedicated documentation](/network/vpc/reference-content/vpc-migration/#public-gateways-and-vpc) for more information.
