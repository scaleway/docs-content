The Scaleway Managed Databases team ran tests on DB-POP2-4C-16G Instances in a Private Network using `pgbench`. Several workloads (including read, oltp and large loads) were simulated with several scale factors (from 1M rows to 200M rows) and concurrent database connections set to 10. They measured the impact of encryption at rest on transactions, per second and latency.

The table below compares the different workload and setup combinations and indicates the perfomance results of each:

| Workload Type        | Setup           | Scale Factor | Performance Impact                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Read Workloads**   | Standalone      | 10           | No impact                                                                          |
|        | Standalone      | 2000         | No real impact with or without encryption at rest                                                |
|                      | HA              | 2000         | 20-30% impact, likely due to disk writes being replicated                         |
| **OLTP Workloads**   | Standalone      | Any          | 15% performance drop with encryption at rest activated                                           |
|         | HA              | 10           | 15% performance drop                                                              |
|                      | HA              | 2000         | Up to 30% performance drop                                                        |
| **Large Data Loads** | Standalone      | Any          | 10% additional latency                                                            |
|           | HA              | Any          | 40% additional latency due to semi-sync replication and encryption overhead       |
