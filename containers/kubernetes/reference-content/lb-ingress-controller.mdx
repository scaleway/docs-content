This document will guide you through deploying a test application on a Kubernetes cluster, exposing it via an ingress object, and using a Scaleway Load Balancer to ensure persistent IP addressing.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Set up a [Kubernetes Kapsule cluster](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster), deploying a TRAEFIK2 ingress controller via the application library using the [Easy Deploy function](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/enable-easy-deploy/)
- Obtained the [kubeconfig](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/edit-cluster/) file for the cluster
- Installed [kubectl](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/connect-cluster-kubectl/) on your local machine

## Exposing the ingress controller using a Scaleway Load Balancer

By default, ingress controllers on Kapsule are deployed using a [hostPort](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/). This ensures accessibility on all cluster nodes via ports 80 and 443. However, for production readiness, you might prefer using a Load Balancer to expose your services to the internet.

<Message type="important">
By default, a new security group that blocks all incoming traffic on the nodes for security purposes is created during cluster configuration. To allow incoming HTTP/80 and HTTPS/443 traffic, you need to modify the security group.

1. In the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/security-groups/), navigate to the **Compute** > **Security groups** section and find the security group named `kubernetes <cluster-id>`.
2. Modify the security group rules to allow incoming traffic on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).
   - Allow TCP traffic on port 80 from all sources (0.0.0.0/0) for HTTP.
   - Allow TCP traffic on port 443 from all sources (0.0.0.0/0) for HTTPS.

### Deploying a test application

1. Deploy the `cafe-ingress` test application:

    ```bash
    kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/main/examples/ingress-resources/basic-auth/cafe.yaml
    ```

2. Create the ingress object (`coffee-ingress.yaml`) using the DNS wildcard provided by Scaleway:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: coffee-ingress
    spec:
      rules:
        - host: YOUR_SCALEWAY_DNS_WILDCARD
          http:
            paths:
              - path: /tea
                pathType: Prefix
                backend:
                  service:
                    name: tea-svc
                    port:
                      number: 80
              - path: /coffee
                pathType: Prefix
                backend:
                  service:
                    name: coffee-svc
                    port:
                      number: 80
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      Your DNS wildcard is composed of your cluster ID (e.g., `68362d3b-57c8-4bea-905a-aeb7f9ab95dc`) followed by `.nodes.k8s.<SCW_REGION>.scw.cloud`. For a cluster located in the Paris region, your DNS wildcard could be, for example: `hotdrinks.68362d3b-57c8-4bea-905a-aeb7f9ab95dc.nodes.k8s.fr-par.scw.cloud`.

3. Apply the configuration:

    ```bash
    kubectl create -f coffee-ingress.yaml
    ```

4. Test the ingress:

    ```bash
    curl http://YOUR_SCALEWAY_DNS_WILDCARD/coffee
    ```

## Using a reserved IP with a Load Balancer

Reserve a flexible Load Balancer IP address [through the Scaleway API](/containers/kubernetes/reference-content/managing-load-balancer-ips/#reserve-a-load-balancer-flexible-ip-address-via-the-api). Take note of the IP address, referred to as `RESERVED_IP` from now on.

### Using the reserved IP in Kubernetes

1. Patch `tea-svc` to use the reserved IP with a `LoadBalancer` service:

   ```bash
   kubectl patch svc tea-svc --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"loadBalancerIP": "RESERVED_IP","type":"LoadBalancer"}}'
   ```

2. Delete `tea-svc`:

   ```bash
   kubectl delete svc tea-svc
   ```

3. Patch `coffee-svc` to use the reserved IP:

   ```bash
   kubectl patch svc coffee-svc --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"loadBalancerIP": "RESERVED_IP","type":"LoadBalancer"}}'
   ```
