## Features

New features are available with PostgreSQL 16:

- The logical replication of databases as a subscriber is now supported. Refer to the [Setting up logical replication as a subscriber in PostgreSQL](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/api-cli/logical-replication-as-subscriber) documentation page for more information.
- Passwords are now encrypted using the `SCRAM-SHA-256` setting. If you upgrade your engine and are currently using MD5, you also have to migrate to SCRAM-SHA-256. Refer to the official [Password Authentication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-password.html#AUTH-PASSWORD) PostgreSQL documentation to learn how to do so.
- Support of the Timescale [pre-restore](https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/administration/#timescaledb_pre_restore) and [post-restore](https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/administration/#timescaledb_post_restore) features. They allow you to restore the database using `pg_restore`.
