Scaleway IPFS provide you with resources to develop, test code and deploy your applications in no time. Instances are designed for modern workflows. They are with you from prototyping to large-scale deployment. You can [create](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance) and manage your Instances from the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/login), via the [API](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/instance/api/) or via the [Scaleway Command Line Interface](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli).

## Scaleway Command Line Interface Overview

[The Scaleway Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli) allows you to pilot your Scaleway infrastructure directly from your terminal, providing a faster way to administer and monitor your resources. Scaleway CLI is easy to set up and use, and an essential tool for operating efficiently in your cloud environment. The CLI provides many functionalities, including the ability to create and manage Instances.

## How to create volume storage IPFS

The volume will serve as a storage area to find the content of all pins, whether they are cids or urls.

Create your volume with CLI command:
```
scw ipfs volume create project-id=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 name=volumename
```

**Sample response**
```
ID         11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
ProjectID  00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
Region     fr-par
CountPin   0
CreatedAt  now
UpdatedAt  now
Name       demo
```

## How add CID in your volume storage IPFS

Now that we have a volume, we can pin cids and urls to it. Let's see how to add a cid using the cli command

1. Add content by cid
  ```
  scw ipfs ipfs add-cid volume-id=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111 cid=yourcid name=newcid
  ```
2. check status about your cid to see if the content is pinned at Scaleway
  ```
  scw ipfs ipfs get-pin-id pin-id=22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222 volume-id=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
  ```

**Sample response**
```
Status          pinned
CreatedAt       5 minutes ago
Cid.Cid         yourcid
Cid.Name        value:"newcid"
Cid.Meta.AppID  00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```
