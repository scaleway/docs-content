You can enable or disable your IoT Hub from the Scaleway console. This can be useful if you want to do maintenance actions on your hub, or if you want to change the [product plan](/managed-services/iot-hub/how-to/change-plan/) of your hub.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created an IoT Hub](/managed-services/iot-hub/how-to/create-hub/)

1. Click **IoT Hub** in the **Managed Services** section of the side menu. The list of your IoT Hubs displays.
2. Click the name of the IoT Hub you want to disable or enable. The hub's overview page displays.
3. Toggle the **Enabled**/**Disabled** switch to change the status of your hub.

4. Confirm the status change by clicking **Disable hub** or **Enable hub** in the pop-up window.
    <Message type="important">
      As long as your hub is disabled, you will not be billed. However, your hub's devices will not be able to connect.
