## Flask Overview

[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a web application framework written
in Python. Flask is easy to get started with as a beginner because
there is little boilerplate code for getting a simple app up and
running.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your SSH key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key)
  - You have [created an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) which is running Ubuntu Bionic Beaver (20.04 LTS)
</Message>

## Setting up the environment

1. [Connect to your Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/) using SSH.
2. Update the apt packet cache and upgrade the software already installed on the Instance:
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```

## Installing Python

If you don't have Python installed on your computer, download the
installer from the Python [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To make sure your Python installation is functional, you can open a
terminal window and type python3, or if that does not work, just python.

```
python3
```

which returns

```
Python 3.8.10 (default, Nov 26 2021, 20:14:08)
[GCC 9.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
```

To exit the interactive prompt, you can type exit() and press Enter. On
the Linux and Mac OS X versions of Python you can also exit the
interpreter by pressing Ctrl-D. On Windows, the exit shortcut is Ctrl-Z
followed by Enter.

## Setting up Flask

In Python, packages such as Flask are available in a public repository,
from where anybody can download and install them. The official
Python package repository is called PyPI, which stands for Python
Package Index.

1. (Optional) If you do not have `pip` installed, launch
    ```
    apt install python3-pip
    ```
2. Install Flask
    ```
    pip install Flask
    ```
3. Create a folder called `FlaskApp`.
    ```
    mkdir FlaskApp
    ```
4. Navigate to the FlaskApp folder and create a file called `app.py`.
    ```
    cd FlaskApp
    nano app.py
    ```
5. Paste the following content to the `app.py` file.
    ```
    from flask import Flask
    app = Flask(__name__)
    @app.route("/")
    def main():
        return "Welcome to the first Flask App!"
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run(host='0.0.0.0')
    ```
6. Save the changes and execute `app.py`.
    ```
    python3 app.py
    ```

    which returns

    ```
      * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
      * Environment: production
        WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production
        environment.
        Use a production WSGI server instead.
      * Debug mode: off
      * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    ```
7. Open you web browser and type the `server_ip:port`. It should display:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-FlaskApp.webp" alt="" />

<Message type="note">
  If you run the server you will notice that the server is only accessible from your own computer, not from any other in the network. This is the default because in debugging mode a user of the application can execute arbitrary Python code on your computer. If you have the debugger disabled or trust the users on your network, you can make the server publicly available simply by adding --host=0.0.0.0 to the command line or editting your `app.py` to match `app.run(host='0.0.0.0')`` This tells your operating system to listen on all public IPs.
</Message>

## Creating URL routes

URL Routing makes URLs in your Web app easy to remember.

We will create several URLs routes:

- /hello
- /writers/
- /writers/tutorials/

1. Copy the code below and save it as `app.py`
    ```
    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route("/")
    def index():
        return "Index!"

    @app.route("/hello")
    def hello():
        return "Hello Cloud Riders!"

    @app.route("/hello")
    def hello():
        return "Hello!"

    @app.route("/writers")
    def writers():
        return "Have a nice day, from the Scaleway Tech Writers!"

    @app.route("/writers/<string:name>/")
    def getWriters(name):
        return name

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run(host='0.0.0.0')
    ```

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run(host='0.0.0.0')
    ```
2. Restart the application using
    ```
    python3 app.py
    ```

    Try the URLs in your browser:

      - http://server_ip:5000/
      - http://server_ip:5000/hello
      - http://server_ip:5000/writers

    Each route should display what is defined in the `app.py` above, for
    instance http://server_ip:5000/hello displays:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-FlaskHello.webp" alt="" />

## Styling Flask Pages

In Flask, templates are written as separate files, stored in a templates folder that is inside the application package. So after making sure that you are in the `FlaskApp` directory, create the directory where templates will be stored.

Following the procedure to create applications shown in the previous steps, we will create a new application called `hello.py` running on port 80. with the following configuration:

```
from flask import Flask, flash, redirect, render_template, request,
session, abort

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def index():
    return "Flask App!"

@app.route("/hello/<string:name>/")
def hello(name):
    return render_template(
        'test.html',name=name)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=80)
```

1. Create a directory called templates
    ```
    mkdir templates
    ```
2. Open a `test.html` file and paste the following
    ```
    nano test.html
    ```
3. Paste the following
    ```html
    {% extends "layout.html" %} {% block body %}

    <div class="block1">
      <h1>Hello {{name}}!</h1>
      <h2>Discover a New Cloud Experience</h2>
      <p>
        "The Disruptive Cloud Computing Platform: Deploy SSD Cloud Servers in
        seconds!!"
      </p>
    </div>
    {% endblock %}
    ```
4. Open a `layout.html` file and paste the following
    ```html
    <html>
    <head>
      <title>Website</title>
      <style>
        @import url(http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Amatic+SC:700);

        body {
          text-align: center;
        }
        h1 {
          font-family: 'Amatic SC', cursive;
          font-weight: normal;
          color: #FD6C9E;
          font-size: 2.5em;
        }
      </style>
    </head>
    <body>
      {% block body %}{% endblock %}
    ```
5. Launch the application
    ```
    python3 hello.py
    ```

    the application should display

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-FlaskHome.webp" alt="" />

## Passing Variables

Let's try and display random Scaleway catch phrase instead of always the same one. We will need to pass both the _name variable_ and the _quote variable_.

1. In the `templates` directory, edit the `test.html` to match the following
    ```html
    {% extends "layout.html" %} {% block body %}

    <div class="block1">
      <h1>Hello {{name}}!</h1>
      <h2>Discover a New Cloud Experience</h2>
      <p>{{quote}}</p>
    </div>
    {% endblock %}
    ```
2. Save and exit
3. In the application called `hello.py` update the configuration to look like this:
    ```
    from flask import Flask, flash, redirect, render_template, request, session, abort
    from random import randint

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route("/")
    def index():
        return "Flask App!"

    #@app.route("/hello/<string:name>")
    @app.route("/hello/<string:name>/")
    def hello(name):
    #    return name
      quotes = [    "Pay as You Go - Enjoy a new cloud experience starting at 0.004euros per hour.",
                  "Multiple Datacenters - Maximize your services reliability by running your infrastructure through autonomous facilities spread across multiple regions.",
                  "Over 5 Tb/s of internet bandwidth - Deliver your content anywhere thanks to our multiple high-end transit providers and the best peerings.",
                  "Limitless Infrastructure Combinations - Additional volumes, movable IPs, security groups and hot snapshots are available on all our servers.",
                  "Developer Tools - Interact with Scaleway and take control of the cloud in minutes with our many tools, resources and third-party applications.",
                  "Hourly Billing - All our cloud resources are billed per hour with monthly capping. Scaleway pricing is predictable and transparent, with no hidden costs."$
      randomNumber = randint(0,len(quotes)-1)
      quote = quotes[randomNumber]

      return render_template(
            'test.html',**locals())

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=80)
    ```

    As you can notice, we updated the `quotes` variable with an array of multiples quotes. These can be accessed as quote[0], quote[1], quote[2] and so on. The function **randint()** returns a random number between 0 and the total number of quotes, one is subtracted because we start counting from zero.

    We also added a **locals()** function which always returns a dictionary of the current namespace.
4. Save and exit
5. Run the application `hello.py`. It will return one of these quotes at random.
    ```
    python3 hello.py
    ```
