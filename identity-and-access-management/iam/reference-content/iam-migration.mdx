This document explains how legacy setups have been automatically migrated with the introduction of [IAM](link).

## Pre-IAM - Legacy features

Prior to the introduction of IAM, Scaleway offered a limited number of account and access management features:

### Organizations and Projects

Organizations and Projects existsed pre-IAM, and persist with the introduction of IAM.

- **Organizations**: As before, when you create a Scaleway account, an [Organization](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts#organization) is automatically created, of which you are the Owner.
- **Projects**: As before, you can create multiple Projects within an Organization, to enable you to group your resources. Each Organization has at least one Project, called **default**, to which all resources you create (Instances, Kubernetes Kapsules, Elastic Metal servers etc) are added if no other Projects are created. When you create new Projects, you can choose which Project to add resources to.

### Members and Roles

You were able to invite other Scaleway users to be a **member** of your Organization. When you did this, you had to select a **role** for them. There were four possible roles, each with different rights and permissions:

- **Owner**: The Owner had full access and permissions within their Organization. You were the Owner of the Organization that was created along with your account. You could not (in most cases) designate another member to be an Owner in your Organization.
- **Administrator**: An Admnistrator had the right to manage and access Projects and billing information. They had all the same permissions as an Owner, exluding the right to edit members’ roles, delete members, manage the support plan or delete the Organization.
- **Editor**: An Editor had the right to create and manage most Organization resources, as well as creating API Keys. They did not have access to billing information nor the right to manage member permissions or alter support plans. Editor members could be granted read access to tickets they did not create, but did not have writing rights.
- **Billing Administrator**: A Billing Administrator had the right only to view and manage the Organization’s billing information. They were not able to view or create resources, add members or manage support plans.

With the introduction of IAM, **members** and **roles** cease to exist. They are replaced by the notions of **guests** and **policies**. Everything that was made possible by members and roles is also possible with IAM, along with many more features including the ability to accord permissions in a much more fine-grained and customised way.

### API keys

Before the introduction of IAM, each user could create one or multiple [API keys]() in order to use the [Scaleway API](). API keys were scoped at Project level, meaning that an Owner, Administrator or Editor would create an API key for each Project they belonged to, and this API key would give them full read/write access to that Project (and only that Project).

With IAM, users will still be able to generate API keys in order to use the Scaleway API. However, API keys will no longer be scoped at Project level, but instead will inherit their permissions from their bearer. See more information [below]().

## IAM - What's new?

### Organizations and Projects

As previously stated, the concepts of Organizations and Projects remain largely unchanged with the introduction of IAM. You are the Owner of the Organization that is created automatically for you with your Scaleway account, and as the Owner you automatically get full permissions and rights for your own Organization. Each Organization will still have a default Project to which all resources are added, though can also create more Projects for the purpose of separating and grouping your Scaleway resources.

If you never used any features such as inviting members to your Organization, assigning roles, or participating as a member in someone else's Organization then you can relax! You don't need to worry about configuring any IAM features and can continue just using your Scaleway account as before.

### Inviting guests and using policies

With IAM, you can invite other Scaleway users to be **guests** in your Organization, and give them the exact permissions and access rights you want them to have via **policies**. Policies are highly flexible and allow you to accord permissions in a very fine-grained way, giving different rights for different resources, Projects or Organization-level features. Check out our documentation to find out how to [invite guests]() and [create policies]().

### IAM users and IAM applications

Human users who are guests in your Organization are called **IAM users**. But IAM also offers you the possibility to create **IAM applications** in order to generate API keys (and set associated permissions via policies) that are not linked to a specific human user but rather to give programmatic access to resources eg for an application or service in a production environment. Read our full documentation on [IAM applications]() to find out more.

### Groups

IAM also lets you create **groups** so you can attach a policy to multiple users and/or applications, giving them all the same permissions. Find out more about groups in our [dedicated how-to]().

### API keys

Previously API keys were [scoped at Project level]() and gave full read/write access to that Project. With IAM, API keys will now be scoped at Organization level and inherit their permissions from their bearer. You can generate one or several API keys for yourself in each of your Organizations, and your API key will inherit the rights that you have in that Organization (ie full access if you are the Owner of the Organization, or else the rights that have been given to you as a guest in that Organization via [policies]()). API keys created for IAM applications work in the same way, giving that application the permissions specified in the policies attached to it. Check out our [API key documentation]() for more information.

## Migrating to IAM

For users exploiting the "old" system, ie those who were members with roles in another Organization (or who had members with roles in their Organization), this functionality has been automatically migrated for you into IAM. You do not need to take any action yourself to transfer your existing set up.

Three **groups** have been created in each Organization: **Administrators**, **Editors** and **Billing Administrators**, each with an attached policy according the exact rights and permissions given by this roles pre-IAM. Any users who had these roles before are now automatically present as IAM users in the relevant Organization and added to the relevant group, preserving their existing rights in that Organization.
