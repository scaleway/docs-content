The RPN (Real Private Network) is a dedicated private network connected to the second network interface of your server.  It allows you to exchange data between your servers over a private network that you control.
This network provides high performance with very low latency and support of jumbo frames as standard. You can easily regroup your servers within your Private Network with a few clicks, regardless of their number or physical location. RPN v2 gives you the flexibility to build your architecture in a secure and isolated environment. You control everything and can setup your own VLANs, IP addresses ranges, subnets, routing tables and network gateways.
RPN v2 also allows you to build security layers to manage your Private Network. Create a public group for your web server applications and place your backend applications in a private group without internet access. All that backed by an insane connectivity for extreme network performances.

## How to create an RPNv2 group

1. Click on **RPN** > **RPN groups** in the menu on top of the console. Then click **Local RPNv2 groups** in the menu on the left. The RPNv2 groups page displays.
2. Click **Add group**. The add RPNv2 groups form displays.
3. Select the type of the group. It can either be **Standard** or **[Q-in-Q](/dedibox-network/rpn/concepts/#q-in-q-mode)**. Then enter the name of the group and select the servers to add to the group. Click **Submit** to confirm.
    <Message type="note">
      A VLAN ID is assigned automatically during the group creation. It is possible to modify the VLAN ID with values between 1 and 3967.

## How to configure the RPN interface

Below you find configuration instructions for the most common operating systems. For more information refer to our how-to about [RPNv2 interface configuration](/dedibox-network/rpn/how-to/configure-rpnv2/).

### How to configure RPNv2 on Debian

1. Install the vlan package by running the following command:
    ```
    sudo apt-get install vlan
    ```
2. Edit your `/etc/network/interfaces` file as follows (assuming your RPN NIC is `eth1` and your VLAN ID is `3900`):
    ```
    auto eth1.3900
    iface eth1.3900 inet static
        address my.pri.vate.address
        netmask my.custom.net.mask
    ```

### How to configure RPNv2 on Ubuntu

<Message type="note">
  The following configuration example uses [Netplan](https://netplan.io/). If you are using a classic network configuration, refer to the [Debian documentation](https://www.debian.org/doc/).

```
network:
    version: 2
    renderer: networkd
    ethernets:
        mainif:
            match:
                macaddress: "de:ad:be:ef:ca:fe"
            set-name: mainif
            addresses: [ "10.3.0.5/23" ]
            gateway4: 10.3.0.1
            nameservers:
                addresses: [ "8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4" ]
                search: [ example.com ]
    vlans:
        vlan15:
            id: 15
            link: mainif
            addresses: [ "10.3.99.5/24" ]
```

### How to configure RPNv2 on CentOS

In the following 'how to' we assume your RPN NIC is `eth1`.

1. Create a configuration file for the parent interface, called `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1`:
    ```
    DEVICE=eth1
    TYPE=Ethernet
    BOOTPROTO=none
    ONBOOT=yes
    ```
2. Create another file for the vlan interface (assuming the VLAN ID is `3900`). The file is called `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1.3900`:
    ```
    DEVICE=eth1.3900
    BOOTPROTO=none
    ONBOOT=yes
    IPADDR=my.pri.vate.address
    PREFIX=CIDR.Netmask
    NETWORK=my.private.address.0
    VLAN=YES
    ```

## How to configure Jumboframes

The RPN supports Jumboframes with a maximum payload of 9000 bytes. You need to configure your RPN interface to send pacekets with a MTU 9000. For more information refer to our how to: [Configuration of Jumboframes](/dedibox-network/rpn/how-to/configure-jumboframes/)

#### CentOS

1. Open the file `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ethX`, where `X` is the number of your interface, in a text editor. Then add the following line to it:
    ```
    MTU="9000"
    ```
2. Restart the network service:
    ```
    service network restart
    ```

#### Debian

1. Open the file `/etc/network/interfaces` in a text editor and insert `mtu 9000` below the line `iface ethX inet static`:
    ```
    auto ethX
    iface ethX inet static
    mtu 9000
    [...]
    ```
2. Restart the network service:
    ```
    service network restart
    ```

#### Ubuntu

1. Open the Netplan configuration file `/etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml` in a text editor and add the line `mtu: 9000` in the configuration of the RPN interface:
    ```
    ethernets:
        enp3s0:
            dhcp4: true
        enp4s0:
            addresses:
                - 192.168.0.10/24
            gateway4: 192.168.0.1
            mtu: 9000
            nameservers:
                addresses:
                    - 1.1.1.1
                    - 2.2.2.2
    ```
2. Save the file, exit the text editor and reload the network configuration:
    ```
    sudo netplan apply
    ```
