## Traefik - Overview

[Traefik](https://containo.us/traefik/) (pronounced traffic) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and Load Balancer designed to make the deploying of microservices easy. Traefik integrates with any HTTP and TCP-based applications and every major cluster technology.

Our goal in this tutorial is to:

- Expose [Traefik 2](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/v2.2/) using a Scaleway Load Balancer
- Deploy a test application on our cluster
- Expose this test application through an ingress object, using [Traefik 2](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/v2.2/) (deployed by Kapsule)
- Expose this application securely (with `https` and [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), using [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager))

This tutorial is divided in two parts:

- First, we will check how to expose the Traefik 2 ingress controller shipped with `Kapsule` with a [Scaleway LoadBalancer](https://www.scaleway.com/en/load-balancer/).
- In the second part, we will deploy a test application expose it in http with a DNS managed by [Scaleway DNS](/network/dns-cloud/concepts), then use `cert-manager` to create a Let's Encrypt certificate and expose this application securely in `https`.

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).
  - You have [created a Kapsule cluster](/compute/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/) with an ingress controller (Traefik 2).
  - You have downloaded the corresponding [kubeconfig](/compute/kubernetes/how-to/edit-cluster/) file and [kubectl](/compute/kubernetes/how-to/connect-cluster-kubectl/) is configured and working.

## Deploying a Load Balancer using the Easy Deploy feature 

<Message type="important">

  You need a Kubernetes Kapsule Cluster deployed with Traefik 2 to follow this tutorial. To deploy your cluster with Traefik 2, use the [easy deploy feature](/compute/kubernetes/how-to/enable-easy-deploy/).

</Message>

1. Click the **Easy Deploy** tab on your clusters overview page. The Easy Deploy feature displays.

2. Click **Deploy an Application**. The application deployment wizard displays.

3. Select **Application Library**, type **Traefik** in the search bar and select the **Traefik 2 Ingress** application. 

<Lightbox src="scaleway_choose_application.webp" alt="" />

4. Enter the name `traefik` for the application and type the `kube-system` namespace name.

<Lightbox src="scaleway_application_name.webp" alt="" />

5. Click **Deploy an application** to deploy the Load Balancer on your cluster.


## Creating a service to deploy a LoadBalancer in front of Traefik 2


To expose Traefik 2 with a Scaleway LoadBalancer, deploy the following `yaml` file on your cluster:

1. Create and open the file `traefik-loadbalancer.yml` in your favorite text editor and copy the following content into it:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: traefik-ingress
    namespace: kube-system
    labels:
      k8s.scw.cloud/ingress: traefik2
  spec:
    type: LoadBalancer
    ports:
      - port: 80
        name: http
        targetPort: 8000
      - port: 443
        name: https
        targetPort: 8443
    selector:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: traefik
  ```

2. Use `kubectl` to deploy the configuration:

  ```
  $ kubectl create -f traefik-loadbalancer.yml
  service/traefik-ingress created
  ```

3. Verify that your LoadBalancer has been deployed correctly:

  ```
  $ kubectl get svc -n kube-system
  traefik-ingress   LoadBalancer   10.37.89.202    195.154.68.108   80:30509/TCP,443:32138/TCP   43s
  ```

  You can see here that the IP address of your LoadBalancer is 195.154.68.108.
  If you 'curl' it you can reach the default backend (saying "404 page not found") as no ingress objects are created and you are reaching it through the IP address:

  ```
  $ curl 195.154.68.108
  404 page not found
  ```

<Message type="note">

It may take some minutes until your cluster is fully deployed and Traefik becomes availale.

</Message>

## Creating a wildcard DNS record and pointing your domain name to the IP address

We will be using the new [DNS product](https://console.scaleway.com/domains/external), available on Scaleway, to create a wildcard record pointing to this IP address (the domain used in this tutorial will be "mytest.com"). A wildcard record (`*.mydomain.com`) allows you to point any sub-domain of your domain to the configured IP address.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-traefik_widlcard.webp" alt="" />

Verify that the domain is pointed to the IP address of your LoadBalancer:

```
$ host foobar.mytest.com
foobar.mytest.com has address 195.154.68.108
```

Your domain is now pointing to your LoadBalancer IP, you can resolve any of your subdomain with that IP.

## Deploying a test application

In this step, we deploy a test application called "tea coffee" which is only printing tea or coffee depending on the subpath you will reach.

1. Use `kubectl` to create the application

  ```
  $ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/master/examples/complete-example/cafe.yaml
  ```

2. Create an associated ingress object pointing to teacoffee.mytest.com by creating and editing the file `ingress-teacoffee.yml` in your favorite text editor:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: Ingress
  metadata:
    name: cafe-ingress
  spec:
    rules:
      - host: teacoffee.mytest.com
        http:
          paths:
            - path: /tea
              pathType: Prefix
              backend:
                service:
                  name: tea-svc
                  port:
                    number: 80
            - path: /coffee
              pathType: Prefix
              backend:
                service:
                  name: coffee-svc
                  port:
                    number: 80
  ```

3. Run the following command to setup the configuration:

  ```
  $ kubectl create -f ingress-teacoffee.yml
  ingress.networking.k8s.io/cafe-ingress created
  ```

4. You can now use `curl` to send a HTTP request this URL. Traefik 2 is working correctly with your wildcard DNS in plain, unencrypted HTTP (web unsecure).

  ```
  $ curl teacoffee.mytest.com/tea
  Server address: 100.64.0.240:8080
  Server name: tea-69c99ff568-c2lc2
  Date: 29/Jun/2020:13:01:19 +0000
  URI: /tea
  Request ID: f3b7f1bcd5dd841d420236906146af9f
  ```

5. To proceed with the tutorial, delete the ingress object created. It will be replaced in future steps.

  ```
  $ kubectl delete ing cafe-ingress
  ```

## Deploying Cert Manager

Cert-manager is in charge of creating [Let's Encrypt](https://www.letsencrypt.org/) TLS certificates to make your website secure, to sum-up:

  - Create an ingress object for a specific subdomain (for instance foobar.mytest.com)
  - Let's Encrypt must be sure that the domain belongs to you. For this reason, Let's Encrypt requests a "challenge", in our case, an HTTP challenge. Meaning here that Let's Encrypt will try to reach `foobar.mytest.com`, and is able to see a specific hash on this page.
  - Cert-manager is serving this page for you by creating an ingress object and using an HTTP server.
  - When the challenge is ok, the certificate is created and added in a certificate object.
  - You can then use this certificate object to serve your website securely (HTTPS).

<Message type="note">

Any modification to the Traefik2 deployed by Kapsule may be overwritten by the reconciliation process, consider [installing it yourself](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/getting-started/install-traefik/) for a production usage.

</Message>

1. Modify the default Traefik 2 daemonset running on Kapsule to do that, add `--entrypoints.websecure.http.tls` in the cmd stanza.

  ```
  $ kubectl edit ds traefik -n kube-system
  daemonset.apps/traefik edited
  []
          - --global.checknewversion
          - --global.sendanonymoususage
          - --entryPoints.traefik.address=:9000
          - --entryPoints.web.address=:8000
          - --entryPoints.websecure.address=:8443
          - --entrypoints.websecure.http.tls
          - --api.dashboard=true
          - --ping=true
          - --providers.kubernetescrd
          - --providers.kubernetesingress
  []
  ```

2. Delete the existing Traefik pods in order to get the new arguments.

  ```
  $ kubectl -n kube-system delete pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=traefik
  ```

3. Use the command below to install cert-manager and its needed CRD ([Custom Resource Definitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)):

  ```
  $ kubectl apply --validate=false -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.7.2/cert-manager.yaml

## Creating the Let's Encrypt issuer

1. Create a cluster issuer that allow you to specify:

    - the Let's Encrypt server, if you want to replace the production environment with the staging one.
    - the mail used by Let's Encrypt to warn you about certificate expiration.

  Copy and paste the following configuration in the file `cluster-issuer.yaml` using your favorite text editor:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
  kind: ClusterIssuer
  metadata:
    name: letsencrypt-prod
  spec:
    acme:
      # You must replace this email address with your own.
      # Let's Encrypt will use this to contact you about expiring
      # certificates, and issues related to your account.
      email: mymail@test.com
      server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
      privateKeySecretRef:
        # Secret resource used to store the account's private key.
        name: issuer-account-key
      # Add a single challenge solver, HTTP01
      solvers:
        - http01:
            ingress:
              class: traefik
  ```

2. Use `kubectl` to apply the configuration:

  ```
  $ kubectl create -f cluster-issuer.yaml
  clusterissuer.cert-manager.io/letsencrypt-prod created
  ```

## Creating and using a Let's Encrypt certificate to serve your website in HTTPS

In this step you will create the Let's Encrypt certificate by specifying:

    - The secret name where the certificate will be stored.
    - The subdomain for which you want to create a certificate.
    - The issuer created before (letsencrypt-prod).

1. Create a edit a file `mycert.yaml` as follows:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
  kind: Certificate
  metadata:
    name: teacoffee-cert
    namespace: default
  spec:
    commonName: teacoffee.mytest.com
    secretName: teacoffee-cert
    dnsNames:
      - teacoffee.mytest.com
    issuerRef:
      name: letsencrypt-prod
      kind: ClusterIssuer
  ```

2. Apply the configuration using `kubectl`:

  ```
  $ kubectl create -f mycert.yaml
  certificate.cert-manager.io/teacoffee-cert created
  ```

3. Check the certificate has been correctly created (you should see "Ready" in the condition):

  ```
  $ kubectl describe certificate -n default teacoffee-cert
  Spec:
    Common Name:  teacoffee.mytest.org
    Dns Names:
      teacoffee.mytest.org
    Issuer Ref:
      Kind:       ClusterIssuer
      Name:       letsencrypt-prod
    Secret Name:  teacoffee-cert
  Status:
    Conditions:
      Last Transition Time:  2021-02-24T16:50:42Z
      Message:               Certificate is up to date and has not expired
      Reason:                Ready
      Status:                True
      Type:                  Ready

    Revision:                1
  Events:

    Normal  Issued     48s   cert-manager  Certificate issued successfully
  ```

4. Create a Standard Ingress, with TLS enabled (with the name of the secret created by the creation of the certificate, in our case: `teacoffee-cert`). To do so create file `mysite.yaml`, copy the following content into it and run kubectl with the collowing command: `kubectl create -f mysite.yaml`

  ```
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: Ingress
  metadata:
    name: testcoffee
    namespace: default
    annotations:
      traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.entrypoints: websecure
  spec:
    tls:
      - secretName: teacoffee-cert
    rules:
      - host: teacoffee.mytest.com
        http:
          paths:
            - path: /tea
              pathType: Prefix
              backend:
                service:
                  name: tea-svc
                  port:
                    number: 80
            - path: /coffee
              pathType: Prefix
              backend:
                service:
                  name: coffee-svc
                  port:
                    number: 80
  ```

5. Check your website is accessible in HTTPS:

    ```
    curl -v https://teacoffee.mytest.com/tea
    *   Trying 195.154.68.108...
    * TCP_NODELAY set
    * Connected to teacoffee.mytest.com (195.154.68.108) port 443 (#0)

6. Access the Traefik 2 dashboard by using this command:

  ```
  $ kubectl port-forward -n kube-system $(kubectl get pods -n kube-system --selector "app.kubernetes.io/name=traefik" --output=name | head -n 1) 9000:9000
  ```

7. You can then access the Traefik 2 dashboard with this address: `http://127.0.0.1:9000/dashboard/` (Note the trailing `/`.)
