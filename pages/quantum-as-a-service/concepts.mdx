### Quantum Computing
Quantum computing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to process information. Unlike classical computers that use **bits** (0 or 1), quantum computers use **qubits**. Qubits can exist in a state of superposition (representing both 0 and 1 simultaneously) and can be entangled. This allows quantum computers to solve specific classes of complex problems—such as optimization, material simulation, and cryptography—exponentially faster than classical supercomputers.

### Hybrid Computing
Quantum computers are not standalone devices; they act as accelerators. **Hybrid Computing** is the practice of orchestrating workflows that combine the best of both worlds:
* **Classical resources (CPU/GPU):** For data pre-processing, post-processing, and managing the workflow.
* **Quantum resources (QPU):** For executing the specific quantum subroutines where they offer an advantage.

Scaleway QaaS is natively hybrid, allowing you to trigger quantum jobs directly from your classical cloud infrastructure.

## QPU (Quantum Processing Unit)
A **QPU** is the physical hardware chip that performs quantum computations. Unlike a CPU, a QPU is extremely sensitive to its environment and often requires cryogenic cooling or vacuum chambers.
* **Nature:** Physical hardware (Photonic, Neutral Atom, Superconducting, etc.).
* **Access:** Often requires reservation (Booking) due to scarcity.
* **Use case:** Final execution, proof of concept, searching for quantum advantage.

### Emulator
An **Emulator** is a software program that mimics the behavior of a QPU. At Scaleway, these emulators run on classical **GPU clusters**.
* **Nature:** Software running on High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure.
* **Access:** On-demand (instant availability).
* **Use case:** Prototyping, debugging, learning, and noise-free verification before deploying to a real QPU.

## Service Architecture

The Scaleway QaaS workflow is built around three main objects: **Platform**, **Session**, and **Job**.

### Platform
A **Platform** is the starting point. It represents a specific combination of hardware and the software stack required to run it. Think of it as a "configuration" or an "image" you select.
* **Uniqueness:** Each Platform ID corresponds to a unique pair of Provider + Technology (e.g., `QPU-ASCELLA-6PQ` for Quandela photonic QPU or `EMU-FRESNEL-100PQ` for Pasqal neutral-atom QPU emulator).
* **Usage:** You must choose a Platform ID to create a **Session**.

### Session
A **Session** is a dedicated time interval during which you have access to a specific Platform to execute your code. It acts as a namespace for your work.

* **Lifecycle:** A session must be explicitly **created** (status: `starting` $\to$ `running`) and **terminated** (status: `stopping` $\to$ `terminated`).
* **Billing:** You are billed for the duration of the session (per minute), from start to stop, regardless of how many jobs you run inside it.
* **Persistence:** Even after a session is terminated, its metadata and the results of the jobs attached to it remain readable (GET/LIST).
* **Constraint:** Once a session is terminated, it cannot be restarted. You must create a new one.

  Think of a Session as "renting the machine". You start the rental, run as many calculations as you want, and stop the rental when you are done.

### Job
A **Job** represents a single unit of work—typically a quantum circuit—submitted to a **Session**.

* **Dependency:** A job is always attached to a **running** session. You cannot submit a job to a stopped session.
* **Immutability:** Once created, a job cannot be deleted (for traceability), though it can be cancelled if it hasn't started processing yet.
* **Statuses:** A job transitions through several states: `waiting` (in queue), `running` (execution on QPU/Emulator), `completed` (results available), or `error`.

## Access modalities

Scaleway QaaS offers two primary ways to access quantum resources, depending on your needs for availability and cost control.

### Emulator - Pay-As-You-Go (On-Demand)
Used only for **Emulators**. You can start a session instantly without prior reservation. The resources (GPUs) are allocated dynamically.
* **Flexibility:** No need to plan ahead. Submit jobs whenever you are ready.
* **Dedicated:** This is your dedicated instance to run emulated quantum **Jobs**, there is no shared queuing.
* **Billing Structure:** You are billed for the **duration** of the **Session** (e.g., per minute or hour), regardless of how many jobs or shots you run during that time.

### QPU - Pay-As-You-Go (On-Demand)
This is the standard access mode for most use cases. Instead of reserving a machine for a specific time, you submit your jobs to a shared queue. You are billed strictly based on the volume of computations performed.

* **Flexibility:** No need to plan ahead. Submit jobs whenever you are ready.
* **Shared Queue:** Your jobs are processed in the order they are received (FIFO), sharing the QPU with other users.
* **Billing Structure:** The cost is calculated based on the number of circuits (jobs) submitted and the total number of "shots" (executions) requested.

<Message type="tip">
  **Formula:** `Total Cost = (Nb_Circuits × Price_per_circuit) + (Total_Shots × Price_per_shot)`
</Message>

#### Example
If you submit **2 quantum circuits**, requesting **1000 shots** for each circuit:
1. **Circuit Fees:** You pay the base fee for 2 circuits.
2. **Shot Fees:** You pay for 2000 shots (2 circuits × 1000 shots).

### QPU - Booking (Reservation)
Because real physical QPUs are scarce resources, **Booking** allows you to reserve a specific hardware backend for a dedicated time slot in the future.

* **Guaranteed Access:** During your booked slot, the hardware is dedicated to you.
* **No Queue:** Your jobs bypass the public queue and are executed immediately.
* **Billing Structure:** You are billed for the **duration** of the reservation (e.g., per minute or hour), regardless of how many jobs or shots you run during that time.
* **Use Case:** Essential for intensive production runs, workshops, or when you need guaranteed throughput on partner hardware (like Pasqal or Quandela).
