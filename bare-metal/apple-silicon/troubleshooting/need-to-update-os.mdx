## Requirements

- Be the [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) of the Organization in which the actions will be performed, or an IAM user with the [necessary permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission)
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- An [SSH key](/console/project/how-to/create-ssh-key/) added to your account
- A [Mac mini](/bare-metal/apple-silicon/how-to/create-mac-mini/)

To update the Operating System installed on your Mac mini, you can use the `softwareupdate` tool.

1. Get a list of all available updates by running the following command:
    ```
    softwareupdate --list
    ```
2. Install all available updates by running the following command:
    ```
    sudo softwareupdate --install
    ```

<Message type="note">
  If you want to upgrade selected packages only, run the following command: `softwareupdate --install package-name`.
