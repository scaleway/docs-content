When hosting healthcare data using Scaleway Block Storage, you must follow the recommendations outlined in the [shared responsibility model](/block-storage/reference-content/storage-shared-responsibility-model/) to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, such as data protection laws, and industry standards.

Adhering to these guidelines helps safeguard sensitive information against unauthorized access, breaches, and data loss, while also clarifying the roles and responsibilities between the cloud provider and the customer.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Signed an HDS contract with Scaleway for the guarantees outlined in the [shared responsibility model](/block-storage/reference-content/storage-shared-responsibility-model/) to apply

## How to create a compliant volume

To host healthcare data in compliance with HDS requirements, you must create a new Block Storage volume.

1. Click **Block Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The Block Storage page displays.
2. Click **+ Create volume**.
3. Follow the steps in the creation wizard:
    - Select an [Availability Zone](/instances/concepts/#availability-zone) within the **PARIS** region.
    - Configure the volume:
        - Enter a name for your volume or leave the automatically generated name.
        - Select an [IOPS](/block-storage/concepts/#iops) option. You cannot edit the IOPS of a volume after its creation.
        - Define a volume size of at least 5 GB.
    - Optionally, select an **HDS-compliant Instance** from the drop-down to attach your volume. The Instance must be within the same Availability Zone as your volume, within the **PARIS** region.
    - Verify the estimated cost.
4. Click **Create volume**. The volume's **Overview** page displays.

## How to encrypt data

To guarantee compliance with HDS requirements, you must proactively encrypt data stored on the Block Storage volume using a reliable mechanism, such as [LUKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup). 

Refer to the dedicated documentation for comprehensive information on [how to encrypt volumes using Cryptsetup with LUKS](/tutorials/encrypt-volumes/).

## How to delete data

Data must be deleted in a compliant way to make sure data cannot be retrieved by any means immediately afterward.

To do so, delete data from your volume as you would with a standard Block Storage volume, then delete the encryption keys used to encrypt the deleted data.

## Prohibited actions on a compliant volume

To host healthcare data, you must comply with the following requirements:

- You must not use an existing Block Storage volume.

- You must not export snapshots to an Object Storage bucket **that is not HDS-compliant**. Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/object-storage/how-to/host-healthcare-data/) to create an HDS-compliant bucket. 

<Message type="important">
Failure to comply with these requirements may lead to voiding compliance on the data contained in the volume.
</Message>

## Compliant volume creation checklist

Make sure that your volume follows the requirements below:

1. Make sure you are using a **new** Block Storage volume.

2. Make sure you have [created your volume](#how-to-create-a-compliant-volume) in an Availability Zone within the **France - Paris** region (`fr-par-1`, `fr-par-2`, `fr-par-3`).

3. Use a [proactive encryption method](#how-to-encrypt-data) to encrypt your data.

4. Follow the provided security best practices at all times.

Refer to the [Storage Shared Responsibility Model](/block-storage/reference-content/storage-shared-responsibility-model/) for comprehensive information on the legal framework to host healthcare data.
