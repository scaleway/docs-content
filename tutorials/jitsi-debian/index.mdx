The tool provides features such as:
* screen sharing
* presentations
* inviting users to a conference through a custom URL

### Installing Jitsi Meet

1. Configure the hostname of the server corresponding to your domain or subdomain.
    ```
    hostnamectl set-hostname jitsi
    sed -i 's/^127.0.1.1.*$/127.0.1.1 jitsi.mydomain.tld jitsi/g' /etc/hosts
    sed -i 's/^127.0.0.1.*$/127.0.0.1 localhost jitsi.mydomain.tld jitsi/g' /etc/hosts
    ```
2. Update the APT package cache and upgrade the software installed on the Instance to the latest version available on the Debian repositories.
    ```
    apt update && apt upgrade
    ```
3. Install an [Nginx](https://nginx.org/) web server. The Jitsi installation tool handles the Nginx configuration if it is present on the system.
    ```
    apt install -y nginx
    systemctl start nginx.service
    systemctl enable nginx.service
    ```

    <Message type="important">
    If you have not installed Nginx or Apache, Jitsi Meet will automatically install [Jetty](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) during the installation.

4. Download the APT key and set up the repositories of Jitsi:
    ```
    wget -qO - https://download.jitsi.org/jitsi-key.gpg.key | apt-key add -
    sh -c "echo 'deb https://download.jitsi.org stable/' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jitsi-stable.list"
    apt update
    ```
5. Launch the installation of Jitsi Meet.
    ```
    apt install -y jitsi-meet
    ```
    When asked:

      - Enter the FQDN of your Instance. For example `jitsi.mydomain.tld` and press **Enter**.
      - Choose the `Generate a new self-signed certificate (You will later get a chance to obtain a Let's Encrypt certificate)` option as an SSL certificate and press **Enter**.
6. Run the following script to generate a [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) SSL certificate for your Instance:
    ```
    /usr/share/jitsi-meet/scripts/install-letsencrypt-cert.sh
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
    If the generation of the Let's Encrypt certificate fails, run the following command: `dpkg-reconfigure jitsi-meet-web-config` to reconfigure the package `jitsi-meet-web-config` before relaunching the certificate request.

7. Open a web browser and type the FQDN of your Instance, for example: `https://jitsi.mydomain.tld`. The following screen displays:
