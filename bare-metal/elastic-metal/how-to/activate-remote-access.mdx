Remote access is available on most Elastic Metal servers. This option allows you to access the keyboard, video, and mouse of the machine remotely through a KVM-over-IP device.
Using remote access, you can access the machine for debugging purposes, even if the installed OS is not working properly. It is also possible to install an Operating System on the machine using a remote ISO file.

  Remote access is an **optional feature** and not available on all Elastic Metal servers. The following steps can be done only on Elastic Metal servers providing remote access.

    <Message type="tip">
      If you can not see the button to activate the remote access feature, it means that this option is not available for your Elastic Metal server.
    </Message>
4. Read and accept the terms and conditions for the remote access feature. Tick the box to confirm you understood the conditions of the option, then click **Activate**.

    <Message type="note">
      Make sure to enter the public IP address of your internet connection, as connections to the remote access device are limited to this IP address for security reasons. Currently, only IPv4 addresses are supported by the remote access feature.
    </Message>

The connection details of your remote access displays. Use the credentials provided to log in at the connection URL.

<Message type="note">
  * Each remote access session has an expiration date when the generated credentials become invalid for new connections. You have to regenerate access then.
  * The remote access option remains active for 48 hours after activation, or until you [deactivate remote access](#deactivating-remote-access) from your console.
</Message>

## Renewing a remote access session

Each remote access session has a limited lifetime for security reasons. To renew a remote access session, scroll to the **Remote access** section on your servers' information page. Then click **Create remote access**.

### Resetting access credentials

You can regenerate new access credentials at any time, even before your session has expired. To do so, click **Reset access** in the remote access session. It will reset the password and generate a new one.


## Deactivating remote access

To deactivate the remote access feature, scroll to the **Remote access** section on your servers' information page. Then click **Disable remote access**.
