<Message type="iam">
If you have [activated IAM](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/activate-iam), you may need appropriate [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) to follow some steps in this document. This could mean:
  - you are the [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) of the [Organization](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#organization) or
  - you are an IAM user of the Organization, with a [policy](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#policy) granting you the necessary [permission sets](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/)
