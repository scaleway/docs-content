This page shows how to create your first [Mac mini M1](/bare-metal/apple-silicon/concepts/#mac-mini-m1) with the Scaleway console.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created your SSH key and added it to your account](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
</Message>


<Message type="important">
  Due to license constraints, the minimum lease for Apple silicon is 24 hours. As a result, a Mac mini M1 can only be deleted after 24 hours have passed from when you initiated the lease.

1. Click **Apple silicon** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Apple silicon creation page displays.

      If you have existing Mac mini M1s in your account, you will see a list of
      these instead of the creation page, alone with the <Icon name="plus" />
      button for creating a new Mac mini M1.
