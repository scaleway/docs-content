Cockpit does not support Grafana-managed alerting. It integrates with Grafana to visualize metrics, but alerts are managed through the Scaleway alert manager. You should use Grafana only to define alert rules, not to evaluate or receive alert notifications. Once the conditions of your alert rule are met, the Scaleway alert manager evaluates the rule and sends a notification to the **contact points you have configured in the Scaleway console**.

This page shows you how to create alert rules in Grafana for monitoring Scaleway resources integrated with Cockpit, such as Instances, Object Storage, and Kubernetes. These alerts rely on Scaleway-provided metrics, which are preconfigured and available in the **Metrics browser** drop-down when using the **Scaleway Metrics data source** in the Grafana interface. This page explains how to use the `Scaleway Metrics` data source, interpret metrics, set alert conditions, and activate alerts.

<Macro id="requirements" />

  - A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
  - Scaleway resources you can monitor
  - [Created Grafana credentials](/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/) with the **Editor** role
  - [Enabled](/cockpit/how-to/enable-alert-manager/) the Scaleway alert manager
  - [Created](/cockpit/how-to/add-contact-points/) at least one contact point **in the Scaleway console**, otherwise, alerts will not be delivered
  - Selected the **Scaleway Alerting** alert manager in Grafana

## Switch to data source managed alerts rules

Data source managed alerts rules allow you to configure alerts managed by the data source of your choice, instead of using Grafana's managed alerting system which is not supported by Cockpit.

1. [Log in to Grafana](/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards/) using your credentials.
2. Click the **Toggle menu** then click **Alerting**.
3. Click **Alert rules** and **+ New alert rule**.
4. In the **Define query and alert condition** section, scroll to the **Grafana-managed alert rule** information banner and click **Switch to data source-managed alert rule**. This step is **required** because Cockpit does not support Grafana’s built-in alerting system, but only alerts configured and evaluated by the data source itself. You are redirected to the alert creation process.

## Define your metric and alert conditions

Switch between the tabs below to create alerts for a Scaleway Instance, an Object Storage bucket, a Kubernetes cluster pod, or Cockpit logs.

<Tabs id="install">
  <TabsTab label="Scaleway Instance">
    The steps below explain how to create the metric selection and configure an alert condition that triggers when **your Instance consumes more than 10% of a single CPU core over the past 5 minutes.**

    1. Type a name for your alert.
    2. Select the data source you want to configure alerts for. For the sake of this documentation, we are choosing the **Scaleway Metrics** data source.
    3. Click the **Metrics browser** drop-down.
        <Lightbox src="scaleway-metrics-browser.webp" alt="" />
        <Lightbox src="scaleway-metrics-displayed.webp" alt="" />
    4. Select the metric you want to configure an alert for. For example, `instance_server_cpu_seconds_total`.
        <Message type="tip">
         The `instance_server_cpu_seconds_total` metric records how many seconds of CPU time your Instance has used in total. It is helpful to detect unexpected CPU usage spikes.
        </Message>
    5. Select the appropriate labels to filter your metric and target specific resources.
    6. Choose values for your selected labels. The **Resulting selector** field displays your final query selector.
        <Lightbox src="scaleway-metric-selection.webp" alt="" />
    7. Click **Use query** to validate your metric selection. Your selection displays in the query field next to the **Metrics browser** button. This prepares it for use in the alert condition, which we will define in the next steps.
    8. In the query field, paste the following query. Make sure that the values for the labels you have selected (for example, `resource_id` and `resource_name`) correspond to those of the target resource.
        ```bash
        rate(instance_server_cpu_seconds_total{resource_id="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",resource_name="name-of-your-resource"}[5m]) > 0.1
        ```
    9. In the **Set alert evaluation behavior** field, specify how long the condition must be true before triggering the alert.
        <Message type="note">
         For example, to wait until the condition has been met continuously for 5 minutes, type `5` and select `minutes` in the drop-down.
        </Message>
    10. Enter a namespace in the **Namespace** field to help you categorize and manage your alert, then click **Enter**.
    11. Enter a name in the **Group** field to help you categorize and manage your alert, then click **Enter**.
    12. Optionally, add a summary and a description.
    13. Click **Save rule** in the top right corner of your screen to save and activate your alert.
    14. Optionally, check that your configuration works by temporarily lowering the threshold. This will trigger the alert and your [contact point](/cockpit/concepts/#contact-points) should receive an email informing them that the alert is firing.
  </TabsTab>
  <TabsTab label="Object Storage bucket">
    The steps below explain how to create the metric selection and configure an alert condition that triggers when **the object count in your bucket exceeds a specific threshold**.

    1. Type a name for your alert.
    2. Select the data source you want to configure alerts for. For the sake of this documentation, we are choosing the **Scaleway Metrics** data source.
    3. Click the **Metrics browser** drop-down.
        <Lightbox src="scaleway-metrics-browser.webp" alt="" />
        <Lightbox src="scaleway-metrics-displayed.webp" alt="" />
    4. Select the metric you want to configure an alert for. For example, `object_storage_bucket_objects_total`.
        <Message type="tip">
         The `object_storage_bucket_objects_total` metric indicates the total number of objects stored in a given Object Storage bucket. It is useful to monitor and control object growth in your bucket and avoid hitting thresholds.

        ```bash
        object_storage_bucket_objects_total{region="fr-par", resource_id="my-bucket"} > 2000
        ```
    9. In the **Set alert evaluation behavior** field, specify how long the condition must be true before triggering the alert.
