Data Lab for Apache Spark™ is a product designed to assist data scientists and data engineers in performing calculations on a remotely managed Apache Spark infrastructure.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Optionally, an [Object Storage bucket](/object-storage/how-to/create-a-bucket/)
- A valid [API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)

1. Click **Data Lab** under **Data & Analytics** on the side menu. The Data Lab for Apache Spark™ page displays.

2. Click **Create Data Lab cluster**. The creation wizard displays.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Choose an Apache Spark version from the drop-down menu.
    - Select a worker node configuration.
    - Enter the desired number of worker nodes.
      <Message type="note">
      Provisioning zero worker nodes lets you retain and access you cluster and notebook configurations, but will not allow you to run calculations.
      </Message>
    - Activate the [persistent volume](/data-lab/concepts/#persistent-volume) if required, then enter a volume size according to your needs.
      <Message type="note">
      Persistent volume usage depends on your workload, and only the actual usage will be billed, within the limit defined. A minimum of 1 GB is required to run the notebook.
      </Message>
    - Enter a name for your Data Lab.
    - Optionally, add a description and/or tags for your Data Lab.
    - Verify the estimated cost.
