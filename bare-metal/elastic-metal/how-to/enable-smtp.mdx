By default, the SMTP ports (25, 465, 587) of your Elastic Metal server are closed, and cannot be reached from our infrastructure.

If you want to send emails from your server, you can enable SMTP for each Availability Zone from the console.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner/) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission/) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An Elastic Metal server [installed](/bare-metal/elastic-metal/quickstart/#how-to-create-an-elastic-metal-server/)
- [Verified your identity](/console/account/how-to/verify-identity/)

  This guide explains how to enable SMTP on Elastic Metal servers. If you want to enable SMTP on other resources, follow our documentation on [how to send emails from your Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/send-emails-from-your-instance/) and [how to enable SMTP on Public Gateways](/network/public-gateways/how-to/configure-a-public-gateway/#how-to-enable-smtp/).

1. Click **Elastic Metal** in the **Bare Metal** section on the side menu of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/).
2. Click the **General Settings** tab. The SMTP configuration displays.
    <Message type="important">
      You have to [verify your identity](/console/account/how-to/verify-identity/) before you can enable the SMTP ports.

3. Toggle the switch to **ON** beside each Availability Zone for which you want to enable SMTP.
