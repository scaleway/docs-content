This page shows how to create your first Scaleway Instance. An [Instance](/compute/instances/concepts/#instance) is a virtual machine in the cloud. Just like a physical machine, it has resources - virtualized CPU, RAM, storage etc. - which vary depending on the [Instance type](/compute/instances/reference-content/choosing-instance-type/) you choose. After you have created your Instance you can [connect](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/) to it and use it for a wide range of computing use cases depending on the Instance type you chose, from running small scale tests and personal projects, to hosting applications and development environments, to setting up a production server.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

Select a tab below for instructions on how to create an Instance via either our [console](https://console.scaleway.com), our [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/), or our [CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli).

      - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
      - You have [created your SSH key and added it to your account](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
    </Message>

    1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Instance creation wizard displays.
        <Lightbox src="scaleway-instance-creation-page.webp" alt="" />

        <Message type="note">
          If you have existing Instances in your account, you will see a list of
          these Instances instead of the Instance creation page, and the <Icon name="plus" />
          button for creating new Instances.
        </Message>
    2. Click **Create Instance**. The Instance creation wizard displays.
        <Lightbox src="scaleway-instance-creation-wizard.webp" alt="" />
    3. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 
        - Choose an **Availability Zone**, which is the geographical region where your Instance will be deployed.
        - Choose an **Instance type**. Different Instance types have different prices, processing power, memory, storage options and bandwidth. See our [dedicated documentation](/compute/instances/reference-content/choosing-instance-type/) to help choose the best Instance type for your needs.
        - Choose an **Image** to run on your Instance. This can be an operating system, an InstantApp or a custom image. A complete list of all available Linux distributions and InstantApps can be found [here](https://www.scaleway.com/en/imagehub/)
        - Add **Volumes**. Volumes are storage spaces used by your Instances. 
          - For **GP1 Instances** you can leave the default settings of a maximum local storage, or choose how much [local](/compute/instances/concepts/#local-volumes) and/or [block](/compute/instances/concepts/#block-volumes) storage you want. Your **system volume** is the volume on which your Instance will boot. The system volume can be either a local or a block volume.
          - **PLAY2**, **PRO2**, and **Enterprise** Instances boot directly [on block volumes](/compute/instances/concepts/#boot-on-block). You can add several block volumes and define how much storage you want for each. 
          <Message type="important">
             - Ensure that a volume with an OS image has a minimum capacity of 10 GB. For a GPU OS, the recommended size is 125 GB.
             - When multiple Block Storage volumes are linked to your Instance, the primary volume will host the OS and is essential for booting the Instance. However, once the Instance is created, you have the option to [modify your boot volume]((/compute/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes/#how-to-change-the-boot-volume)).
             - Booting from a volume that either lacks an OS or is among multiple volumes with identical operating systems can lead to inconsistent boot outcomes.
          </Message>
        - Assign a public IP to the Instance.
          - By default, a public IP is assigned to your Instance. You can choose either to use a **NAT public IP** (a public IP address that uses a carrier-grate NAT to translate the Instances private IP address) or a **Routed public IP** (a dedicated public IP address routed to your Instance that allows direct communication between the Instance and the Internet). If you are unsure which to use, we recommend a routed public IP for ease of use and improved performance.
          - Select whether you want to allocate a new IPv4 to the Instance, or use one of your existing IP(s).
          - If you want to create an Instance without a public IPv4 address, toggle the switch to disable IPv4.
          - Tick the checkbox to assign a globally routed IPv6 address to your Instance.
          - You can attach up to 5 IPs to an Instance, combining both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. 
        - Enter a **Name** for your Instance, or leave the randomly-generated name in place. Optionally, you can add [tags](/compute/instances/concepts/#tags) to help you organize your Instance. 
        - Click **Advanced options** if you want to configure a [cloud-init configuration](/compute/instances/concepts/#cloud-init). Otherwise, leave these options at their default values. 
        - Verify the [SSH keys](/console/my-account/concepts/#ssh-key) that will give you access to your Instance.
        - Verify the **Estimated cost** of your Instance, based on the specifications you chose.
    4. Click **Create Instance** to finish. The creation of your Instance begins, and you will be informed when the Instance is ready.

        Your Instance is now created, and you are redirected to the **Overview** tab. From here, you can see information including your Instance's Public IP, the SSH command to use to [connect to it](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/), and other information, settings, and actions for the Instance.

    1. Open a terminal and configure your environment variables with the `export` commands shown below.

        <Message type="note">
          This is an optional step that seeks to simplify your usage of the API. Ensure that you replace the variables represented by triangle brackets in the example below with your own customized values:
            - The API [access key and secret key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#api-key) that you created.
            - The Project ID of the [Project](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#project) you want to create the Instance in. You can find your Project ID in the [**Settings** tab](https://console.scaleway.com/project/settings) of the relevant Project in the Scaleway console.
            - The [Availability Zone](/compute/instances/concepts/#availability-zone) you want to create the Instance in, e.g. `fr-par-1`.
        </Message>

        ```bash
        export SCW_ACCESS_KEY="<API access key>"
        export SCW_SECRET_KEY="<API secret key>"
        export SCW_PROJECT_ID="<Project ID>"
        export SCW_DEFAULT_ZONE="<Availability Zone>"
        ```
      
    2. Customize the **payload** for your API call. This payload specifies the configuration of the Instance you want to create. We provide an example payload below with all the required parameters, and a table of information to help you adapt it to your needs.

        ```
        {
          "name": "my-new-instance",
          "project": "'""$SCW_PROJECT_ID""'",
          "commercial_type": "GP1-S",
          "image": "544f0add-626b-4e4f-8a96-79fa4414d99a",
          "enable_ipv6": true,
          "volumes 
              "0": {
                "name": "my-volume",
                "size": 300000000000,
                "volume_type": "l_ssd"
              }
          }
        }
        ``` 
        
        | Parameter       | Description                                         | Valid values                           |
        |-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
        | name            | A name of your choice for the Instance (string)     | Any string containing only alphanumeric characters, dots, spaces and dashes, e.g. `"my-new-instance"`. |
        | project         | The Project in which the Instance should be created (string)| Any valid Scaleway Project ID (see above), e.g. `"b4bd99e0-b389-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002"` |
        | commercial-type | The commercial Instance type to create  (string)    | Any valid ID of a Scaleway commercial Instance type, e.g. `"GP1-S"`, `"PRO2-M"`. Use the [List Instance Types](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/#path-instance-types-list-instance-types) endpoint to get a list of all valid Instance types and their IDs.   |
        | image           | The image to install on the Instance, e.g. a particular OS (string) | Any valid Scaleway image ID, e.g. `"544f0add-626b-4e4f-8a96-79fa4414d99a"` which is the ID for the `Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish` image. Use the [Marketplace API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/marketplace/) endpoint to find available images and their IDs. |
        | enable_ipv6     | Whether to enable IPv6 on the Instance (boolean)    | `true` or `false`                   |
        | volumes         | An object that specifies the storage volumes to attach to the Instance. Must respect the volume constraints of the `commercial_type` (i.e. for each type of Instance, a minimum amount of storage is required, and there is also a maximum that cannot be exceeded. Some Instance types support only Block Storage (`b_ssd`), others also support local storage (`l_ssd`) ). These constraints are available at the [List Instance Types](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/#path-instance-types-list-instance-types) endpoint, via the `volume_constraints` parameter for each type listed in the response | A (dictionary) object with a minimum of one key (`"0"`) whose value is another object containing the parameters `"name"` (a name for the volume), `"size"` (the size for the volume, in bytes), and `"volume_type"` (`"l_ssd"`, `"b_ssd"` or `"unified"`). Additional keys for additional volumes should increment by 1 each time (the second volume would have a key of `1`.) Further parameters are available, and it is possible to attach existing volumes rather than creating a new one, or create a volume from a snapshot. For full details see [here](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/#path-volumes).  |

    3. Use the following curl command, replacing the payload with the one you specified at step 2, to create your Instance.

        ```
        curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
        "https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/{$ZONE}/servers" \
        -d '{"name": "my-new-instance", "project": "'"$PROJECT_ID"'", "commercial_type": "GP1-S", "image":"544f0add-626b-4e4f-8a96-79fa4414d99a","enable_ipv6": true, "volumes":{"0":{"name": "my-volume","size": 300000000000,"volume_type": "l_ssd"}}}'
        ```

    Valid Instance creation results in a `201` response containing a `server` object which confirms the attributes of your Instance.

    <Message type="tip">
      To make this response more readable, try adding `| jq '.'` to the end of the command shown in step three. This tells your shell to use the [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) JSON processor to parse the response received from this call and display it in a formatted way.
    </Message>

    <Message type="tip">
      When creating an Instance via the API, it is in a powered off state by default. To power it on, call the [Perform action](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/#path-instances-perform-action) endpoint, passing it the ID of your Instance (returned in the 201 response at step 3) and `poweron` as the `action` to perform.
