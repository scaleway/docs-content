If you want to scale up the size of your Database for Redis™, you can edit your node settings to either:

  - **scale vertically**: upgrade to a bigger node type to allow increased traffic for the same endpoint.
  - **scale horizontally**: add more nodes to your Database Instance to increase your number of endpoints and distribute cache. This setting is only avaialble for Database Instances in cluster mode.
