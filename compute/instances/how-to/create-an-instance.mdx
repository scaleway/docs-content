This page shows how to create your first Scaleway Instance. An [Instance](/compute/instances/concepts#instance) is a computing unit, either virtual or physical, that provides resources to run your applications on. After you have created your Instance, you can connect to it as root and use it as you wish.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created your SSH key and added it to your account](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)

## How to create an Instance

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Instance creation page displays.

  If you have existing Instances in your account, you will see a list of
  these Instances instead of the Instance creation page, and the <Icon name="plus" />
  button for creating new Instances.

2. Click **Create an Instance**. The Instance creation wizard displays.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 

    - Choose an **Availability Zone**, which is the geographical region where your Instance will be deployed.
    - Choose an **Image** to run on your Instance. This can be an operating system, an InstantApp or a custom image. A complete list of all available Linux distributions and InstantApps can be found [here](https://www.scaleway.com/en/imagehub/).

  <Message type="note">

    InstantApps are not available on [Enterprise Instances](/compute/instances/concepts#enterprise-instance)

    - Choose an **Instance type**. Different Instance types have different prices, processing power, memory, SSD disks and bandwidth. 
    - Add **Volumes**. This is an optional step. Volumes are storage spaces used by your Instances. You can leave the default settings of a minimum local storage, or choose to add more [block](/compute/instances/concepts#block-volumes) or [local](/compute/instances/concepts#local-volumes) storage to your Instance. 
    - Enter a **Name** for your Instance, or leave the randomly-generated name in place. Optionally, you can also add tags (/compute/instances/concepts#tags) to help you organize your Instance. 
    - Click **Advanced Options** if you want to configure a [flexible IP](/compute/instances/concepts#flexible-ip), a local bootscript or a [cloud-init configuration](/compute/instances/concepts#cloud-init). Otherwise, leave these options at their default values. 
    - Verify the [SSH Keys](/console/my-account/concepts#ssh-key) that will give you access to your Instance.
    - Verify the **Estimated Cost** of your Instance, based on the specifications you chose.

4. Click **Create a new Instance** to finish. The creation of your Instance begins, and you will be informed when the Instance is ready.

Your Instance is now created and you are redirected to the **Overview** tab. From here, you can see information including your Instance's Public IP, the SSH command to use to [connect to it](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/), and other information, settings, and actions for the Instance.
