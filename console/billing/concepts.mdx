## Billing alerts

The Billing Alerts functionality within the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) allows users to oversee and control their expenses efficiently. This feature allows you to create alerts that notify [users](/en/docs/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#user) when predefined budget thresholds are met. Your alerts can be seamlessly delivered through SMS, email, or API webhook channels.

## Billing API

Scaleway's [Billing API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/billing/) allows you to obtain a quick overview of your cloud consumption and to monitor your expenses programmatically.

## Billing contact

The billing contact is an additional contact who will receive the invoice or payment alerts by email. This allows you to add a person who may not have access to the Scaleway console, but who should be aware of billing, payment documents and notifications. You can add a billing contact directly from the user account section of your [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).

## Billing cycle

Scaleway issues invoices each month based on the resource consumption from the previous month. Our reference billing period is the definition of a calendar month in the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) time zone. The automatic payment of invoices occurs in the first few days of the month, once the invoice is issued and processed using the preferred [payment method](#payment-methods) of your account.

## Billing information

Consists of information about the Organization that will be billed. They will appear on the invoice and can be modified on the Scaleway console. Find out more about [how to read an invoice](/en/docs/faq/billing/#how-to-read-my-invoice).

## Consumption pie chart

The consumption pie chart reflects the amount of money spent on the products you've used. Its monetary value is calculated in real-time, providing an instant overview of your expenses. Click **Billing** in the Organization drop-down menu of your Scaleway console to view your current consumption.

## Cost Manager

Cost manager is a comprehensive and user-friendly tool to monitor and analyze cloud resource consumption, costs, and trends. It offers a clear and detailed view of consumption data, enabling users to accurately reconcile costs for re-invoicing purposes.

## Free Tier

Scaleway offers free tiers for certain products. This means these products can be used at no cost, up to the specified usage limit of the free tier. These limits do not have an expiration date but may be subject to change. Eligible customers can enjoy these select services free of charge when creating an account, with a usage limit in place.

## Free Trial

A free trial provides users access to specific products at no cost. However, it is available only for a limited duration and usage quantity.

## IAM billing permission

IAM billing permissions can be given to users to allow them to read and/or manage the Organization's billing. There are two permission sets linked to billing:

Billing read only: List and read access to billing information. This allows the user to view consumption, invoices, discounts, budget alerts and payment methods.
Billing Manager: Full access to billing management. This allows the user to list, read and edit billing contact information, payment information, billing alerts and invoices.

<Message type="note">

You can give users permissions via [policies](/en/docs/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#policy), or by adding them to a [group](/en/docs/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#group) already attached to a relevant policy.

## Pay as you go

Scaleway offers public cloud services that follow a 'pay as you go' model, ensuring you pay only for what you use. Some products offer additional plan options. Your monthly invoice, calculated at the end of the month, is based on exact resource usage and may include additional invoices for upfront payments during the month.

## Payment methods

The payment methods registered on your account are used to pay your invoice. You can set one of your payment methods as the default and manage your different payment methods from the console.

## Project

A Project is a grouping of Scaleway [resources](/en/docs/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#resource). Each Scaleway Organization comes with a default Project, and you can create new Projects if necessary. Projects are cross-regional, meaning resources located in different [regions](/compute/instances/concepts/#region) can be grouped into one single Project. When grouping resources into different Projects, you can use [IAM](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#iam) to define custom access rights for each Project.

## Pro-rata billing

You are billed pro-rata on Dedibox and Web Hosting services for the initial month of a subscription. This means the charge is adjusted to reflect the portion of the first month you used the service. Starting from the second month and onwards, you are billed in full at the beginning of each month, covering the entire upcoming billing period in advance. This billing model ensures that you pay for the service based on your actual usage for the first month and then in advance for subsequent months.

## Support plan

Scaleway provides four different types of [support plans](https://console.scaleway.com/support/plans): Basic, Bronze, Silver and Gold. Your support plan determines the level of service and dedicated assistance you have access to, and the guaranteed response time of your support requests. You can [configure your support plan in the console](/console/account/how-to/configure-support-plans/).



## Voucher

A Scaleway voucher provides you with a discount or credits to use on our services. You may receive one as part of a promotional campaign or from your account manager. To redeem a voucher, you need to [create a Scaleway account](/console/account/how-to/create-an-account) and have a valid payment method. Voucher codes are unique and valid only for a defined period.
