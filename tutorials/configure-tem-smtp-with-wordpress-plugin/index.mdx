## Configuring and logging in to your WordPress website

6. Click **Activate** under the plug-in.

## Configuring the WordPress plug-in

1. Hover over **WP Mail SMTP** in the WordPress left-side menu, and click **Settings**. You are redirected to the **General** tab.
2. Click the **Launch Setup Wizard** to configure the plug-in. You are redirected to the WP Mail SMTP welcome page.

5. Enter `smtp.tem.scw.cloud` in the **SMTP Host** field.
