## Problem

I get error messages when testing private Serverless Functions using the Scaleway Console.

### Cause

[Private](/serverless/functions/concepts/#privacy-policy) functions require a `X-Auth-Token` HTTP header when being run or tested.

### Possible solutions

Make sure that you have [created an authentication token](/serverless/functions/how-to/create-auth-token-from-console/) from the Scaleway console, and passed it as a HTTP header while [testing your function](/serverless/functions/how-to/test-a-function).
