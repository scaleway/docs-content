The snapshot transfer feature allows you to export or import Instance snapshots. Snapshots are created using the QCOW2 format and stored in a Scaleway Object Storage Bucket.

A snapshot (a valid QCOW2 image) stored in a Scaleway Object Storage bucket can be imported into any Availability Zone, as long as it is in the same region as the bucket. This allows you to create Instances in other Availability Zones within the same region. For example, you can deploy Instances in `fr-par-2` based on the snapshot exported from an Instance in `fr-par-1`.

More information on the QCOW2 file format, and how to use it can be found in the [QEMU documentation](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html#cmdoption-image-formats-arg-qcow2).

## Creating a snapshot from your existing Instance

<Message type="note">

For the sake of this how-to guide, we assume you have an Instance running in the `fr-par-1` Availability Zone, your Object Storage bucket is located in the region `fr-par`, and you want to create the new Instance in the `fr-par-2` Availability Zone.

1. Go to the [Instances section](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) of the Scaleway console and click the **Snapshots** tab. 

2. Click **+ Create a new snapshot**. The snapshot creation wizard displays. Enter a name and select the volume to snapshot. Then click **Create a new snapshot**. The snapshot is created, and the list of all your snapshots displays.

3. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the relevant snapshot, and select **Copy to bucket**. A pop-up displays. Enter the file name for your exported snapshot copy and select the destination bucket. Then click **Create a copy**.

## Importing the snapshot into the destination AZ

1. Enter the [Object Storage section](https://console.scaleway.com/object-storage/buckets) of the Scaleway console and click on the bucket you have exported the snapshot into. The snapshot copy displays in the list of your objects.

  <Message type="note">

  Depending on the size of your snapshot, the export to Object Storage may take some time. It is ready once the status indicator changes to green.

2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the snapshot object, then click **Import as snapshot**. A pop-up displays. Enter the name of the snapshot, select the destination AZ and choose the snapshot type.

  <Message type="important">

  Make sure that the QCOW / QCOW2 image file you want to import, uses the file extension `.qcow` or `.qcow2` to avoid issues while importing the image.

  </Message>

  The type can be either **Local SSD**, **Block SSD** or **Unified**. Use **Unified** if you want to be able to create both **Local SSD** and **Block SSD** volumes from this snapshot. Click **Create a copy** to import the snapshot into the destination AZ.

  <Message type="important">

  Imported snapshots should have a volume size of between one gigabyte and one terabyte.

## Creating Instances from the imported snapshot

1. Go to the [Instances section](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) of the Scaleway console and click **+Create an Instance**.

2. Select the Availability Zone into which you have imported the snapshot and the desired Instance type. Under **Choose an Image**, click **My Snapshots** to select the imported snapshot.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-snapshot-imported.webp" alt="" />

3. Optionally add additional volumes, enter a name and optional tags. Once your configuration is complete, click **Create a new Instance** to launch the Instance creation process.

You can now connect to your new Instance using SSH. It uses the same software configuration as the source Instance.
