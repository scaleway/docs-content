A **bucket policy** is a resource-based policy option. It allows you to grant more granular access to Object Storage resources.

By default, all Object Storage resources in a project are private and can be accessed only by users or applications with IAM permissions to do so. Adding a bucket policy to a bucket allows you to specify who can perform which actions on a bucket and the objects it contains. You can use different combinations of the policy's component strings to customize your permissions for different purposes as required.
