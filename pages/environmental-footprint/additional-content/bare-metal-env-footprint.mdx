Bare Metal

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-allocation-rules-customer-it-equip.webp" alt="" />

  For bare metal servers, the allocation of environmental impact is straightforward due to the direct association between a user and a server. The environmental impact of a bare metal server is entirely attributed to the user utilizing it. This encompasses the energy consumption during its operation, as well as a portion of the impact from the server's manufacturing process.

  The manufacturing impact is prorated based on the server's lifespan and the duration of its use by the customer. By dividing the total manufacturing impact by the expected lifetime of the server and then allocating it according to the specific usage period, we ensure that each user is accountable for their fair share of the server's overall environmental footprint.

    Currently, our calculations for Elastic Metal GPU servers do not include the environmental impact of GPU manufacturing due to insufficient data from the manufacturer. While the impact of CPUs, RAM, disk, and energy consumption is accounted for, the absence of GPU manufacturing data means the figures provided today are underestimated.

    We will update our methodology as soon as more reliable data on GPU manufacturing becomes available.

  ##### Calculation example

    For the use of an Elastic Metal server, with a lifespan of 6 years (52 560 hours) and power of 110w, for 100 hours and considering via Boavizta estimates that the impact of the manufacturing of this server is 850 kgCo2e, we make the following calculation:

    ```math
    ServerManufacturing = (100 / 52560) * 850 = 1,62 kgCO2e
    ```

    Therefore 1,62 kgCO2e is added to the total manufacturing impact for the use of this server.
