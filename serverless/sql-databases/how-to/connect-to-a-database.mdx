This page shows you how to set up the connection to a Serverless SQL Database using the Scaleway Console.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">

    </Message>

3. Set up the **Connection string**:

    - If you already have a secret key, paste it in the connection string in place of the ``[INSERT_SECRET_KEY_HERE]`` placeholder.

    - If you do not have a secret key, click **Generate new secret key**.

4. Copy your connection string and store it securely.

5. In a terminal, run the following command:

    ```bash
    psql "[YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING]"
    ```

An output similar to the following response displays:

    ```bash
    psql (15.3, server 14.8 (Debian 14.8-1pgsg120+1))
    SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, compression: off)
    Type "help" for help.
    ```
