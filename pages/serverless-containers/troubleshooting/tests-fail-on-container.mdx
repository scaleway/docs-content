## Problem

I get error messages when testing Serverless Containers using the Scaleway Console.

## Cause

Testing **Private** Serverless Containers is not possible using the Scaleway console due to CORS limitations.

## Possible solutions

- Change the visibility of your function to **public**. Public containers can be executed anonymously.

- Make sure you have created an [authentication token](/serverless-containers/how-to/create-auth-token-from-console/) for your private function, then exexute a `curl` request from a terminal, as shown below:
    ```sh
    curl -H "X-Auth-Token: <YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>" \ <YOUR_CONTAINER_ENDPOINT>
    ```
