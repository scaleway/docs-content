## Attach

Attaching storage to your Scaleway Instance enables you to use additional or shared storage beyond its [Local Storage](/local-storage/).

## Availability Zone

<Macro id="availability-zone" />

## Block volumes

<Macro id="block-volumes" />

## File Storage

Scaleway File storage allows you to keep data in an organized hierarchy of files and folders. This hierarchy can be shared across a network, so multiple compute instances can work on the same collection of files.

## File system

A file system provides a structured way to manage files and directories in the cloud, so that Instances can access, read, and write data as if it were on a local disk. File systems can be shared by several [Instances](/instances/).

## IOPS

IOPS or Input/Ouptut Operations Per Second, is a unit of measurement that indicates how many read/write operations a storage device is performing per second.

Scaleway File Storage offers two IOPS limits:

- 5 000 IOPS (5K IOPS)
- 15 000 IOPS (15K IOPS)

## Mount

Mounting a storage volume allows you you to assign a directory (mount point) to an [attached](#attach) storage volume. The files on that storage become available via the assigned directory. This allows you to read and write files on the storage as if they were part of your local file system.

## Region
