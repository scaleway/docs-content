Prometheus is a flexible monitoring solution that is in development since 2012. The software stores all its data in a time series database and offers a multi-dimensional data-model and a powerful query language to generate reports of the monitored resources.

In this tutorial you learn, how to use a Prometheus Monitoring Instance with a Grafana dashboard.

## Preparing your environment

1. Run the following command to create a user for Prometheus and Node Exporter. In this tutorial, we will create it without the login option.

    To achieve this, we use the parameter `--no-create-home` which skips the creation of a home directory and disable the shell with `--shell /usr/sbin/nologin`.

    ```
    useradd --no-create-home --shell /usr/sbin/nologin prometheus
    useradd --no-create-home --shell /bin/false node_exporter
    ```
2. Create the folders required to store the binaries of Prometheus and its configuration files.
    ```
    mkdir /etc/prometheus
    mkdir /var/lib/prometheus
    ```
3. Set the ownership of these directories to our `prometheus` user, to make sure that Prometheus can access to these folders.
    ```
    chown prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus
    chown prometheus:prometheus /var/lib/prometheus
    ```

## Downloading and installing Node Exporter

As your Prometheus is only capable of collecting metrics, we want to extend its capabilities by adding **Node Exporter**, a tool that collects information about the system including [CPU, disk, and memory usage](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter#enabled-by-default) and exposes them for scraping.

1. Download the latest version of Node Exporter:
    ```
    wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.5.0/node_exporter-1.5.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    ```
2. Unpack the downloaded archive. This will create a directory `node_exporter-1.5.0.linux-amd64`, containing the executable, a readme and license file:
    ```
    tar xvf node_exporter-1.5.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    ```
3. Copy the binary file into the directory `/usr/local/bin` and set the ownership to the user you have created in step previously:
    ```
    cp node_exporter-1.5.0.linux-amd64/node_exporter /usr/local/bin
    chown node_exporter:node_exporter /usr/local/bin/node_exporter
    ```
4. Remove the leftover files of Node Exporter, as they are not needed any longer:
    ```
    rm -rf node_exporter-1.5.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz node_exporter-1.5.0.linux-amd64
    ```
5. To run Node Exporter automatically on each boot, a systemd service file is required. Create the following file by opening it in Nano:
    ```
    nano /etc/systemd/system/node_exporter.service
    ```
6. Copy the following information in the service file, save it and exit `nano`:
    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=Node Exporter
    Wants=network-online.target
    After=network-online.target

    [Service]
    User=node_exporter
    Group=node_exporter
    Type=simple
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/node_exporter

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      Collectors are used to gather information about the system. By default, a set of collectors is activated. You can see the details about the set in the [README file](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/blob/master/README.md/#enabled-by-default). If you want to use a specific set of collectors, you can define them in the `ExecStart` section of the service. Collectors are enabled by providing a` --collector.<name>` flag. Collectors that are enabled by default can be disabled by providing a `--no-collector.<name>` flag.
    </Message>
7. Reload Systemd to use the newly defined service.
    ```
    systemctl daemon-reload
    ```
8. Run Node Exporter by typing the following command.
    ```
    systemctl start node_exporter.service
    ```
9. Verify that the software started successfully.
    ```
    systemctl status node_exporter.service
    ```

    You will see an output like the following, showing you the status `active (running)` as well as the main PID of the application:

    ```
    ● node_exporter.service - Node Exporter
        Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/node_exporter.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)
        Active: active (running) since Thu 2023-02-23 14:27:05 UTC; 10s ago
      Main PID: 1603 (node_exporter)
          Tasks: 5 (limit: 4111)
        Memory: 2.7M
            CPU: 14ms
        CGroup: /system.slice/node_exporter.service
                └─1603 /usr/local/bin/node_exporter
    ```
10. If everything is working, enable Node Exporter to start upon boot.
    ```
    systemctl enable node_exporter.service
    ```

## Downloading and installing Prometheus

1. Download and unpack [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/download/) latest release of Prometheus. In this tutorial, we use version 2.42.0.
    ```
    apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
    wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.42.0/prometheus-2.42.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    tar xfz prometheus-*.tar.gz
    cd prometheus-2.42.0.linux-amd64/
    ```

    The following two binaries are in the directory:
      - prometheus - Prometheus' main binary file
      - promtool

    The following two folders (which contain the web interface, configuration files examples and the license) are in the directory:
      - consoles
      - console_libraries
2. Copy the binary files into the `/usr/local/bin/`directory:
    ```
    cp ./prometheus /usr/local/bin/
    cp ./promtool /usr/local/bin/
    ```
3. Set the ownership of these files to the `prometheus` user previously created:
    ```
    chown prometheus:prometheus /usr/local/bin/prometheus
    chown prometheus:prometheus /usr/local/bin/promtool
    ```
4. Copy the `consoles` and `console_libraries` directories to `/etc/prometheus`:
    ```
    cp -r ./consoles /etc/prometheus
    cp -r ./console_libraries /etc/prometheus
    ```
5. Set the ownership of the two folders, as well as of all files that they contain, to our `prometheus` user:
    ```
    chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/consoles
    chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/console_libraries
    ```
6. In our home folder, remove the source files that are not needed anymore:
    ```
    cd .. && rm -rf prometheus-\*
    ```

## Configuring Prometheus

Prior to using Prometheus, it needs basic configuring. Thus, we need to create a configuration file named `prometheus.yml`

<Message type="note">
  The configuration file of Prometheus is written in [YAML](https://yaml.org/) which strictly forbids to use tabs. If your file is incorrectly formatted, Prometheus will not start. Be careful when you edit it.
</Message>

1. Open the file `prometheus.yml` in a text editor:
    ```
    nano /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    ```

    Prometheus' configuration file is divided into three parts: `global`, `rule_files`, and `scrape_configs`.

    In the `global` part we can find the general configuration of Prometheus: `scrape_interval` defines how often Prometheus scrapes targets, `evaluation_interval` controls how often the software will evaluate rules. Rules are used to create new time series and for the generation of alerts.

    The `rule_files` block contains information of the location of any rules we want the Prometheus Instance to load.

    The last block of the configuration file is named `scape_configs` and contains the information which resources Prometheus monitors.

    Our file should look like this example:

    ```
    global:
      scrape_interval:     15s
      evaluation_interval: 15s

    rule_files:
      # - "first.rules"
      # - "second.rules"

    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'prometheus'
        scrape_interval: 5s
        static_configs:
          - targets: ['localhost:9090']
    ```

    The global `scrape_interval` is set to 15 seconds which is enough for most use cases.

    We do not have any `rule_files` yet, so the lines are commented out and start with a `#`.

    In the `scrape_configs` part we have defined our first exporter. It is Prometheus that monitors itself. As we want to have more
    precise information about the state of our Prometheus Instance we reduced the `scrape_interval` to 5 seconds for this job.
    The parameters `static_configs`and `targets` determine where the exporters are running. In our case it is the same Instance, so we use `localhost` and the port `9090`.

    As Prometheus scrapes only exporters that are defined in the `scrape_configs` part of the configuration file, we have to add Node Exporter to the file, as we did for Prometheus itself.

    We add the following part below the configuration for scrapping Prometheus:

    ```
    - job_name: 'node_exporter'
      scrape_interval: 5s
      static_configs:
        - targets: ['localhost:9100']
    ```

    Overwrite the global scrape interval again and set it to 5 seconds. As we are scarping the data from the same Instance as Prometheus is running on, we can use `localhost` with the default port of Node Exporter: `9100`.

    If you want to scrape data from a remote host, you have to replace `localhost` with the IP address of the remote Instance.

    <Message type="tip">
      For all information about the configuration of Prometheus, you may check the [configuration documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/).
    </Message>
2. Set the ownership of the file to our `Prometheus` user:
    ```
    chown prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    ```

Our Prometheus Instance is ready to run for the first time.

## Running Prometheus

1. Start Prometheus directly from the command line with the following command, which executes the binary file as our `Prometheus` user:
    ```
    sudo -u prometheus /usr/local/bin/prometheus --config.file /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml --storage.tsdb.path /var/lib/prometheus/ --web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles --web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries
    ```

    The Instance starts displaying multiple status messages and the information that the Instance has started:

    ```
    ts=2023-02-23T14:32:10.321Z caller=main.go:556 level=info msg="Starting Prometheus Server" mode=Instance version="(version=2.42.0, branch=HEAD, revision=225c61122d88b01d1f0eaaee0e05b6f3e0567ac0)"

    ts=2023-02-23T14:32:10.336Z caller=main.go:978 level=info msg="Server is ready to receive web requests."
    ```
2. Open your browser and type `http://IP.OF.YOUR.SERVER:9090` to access the Prometheus interface. If everything is working, we end the task by pressing on `CTRL + C` on our keyboard.
    <Message type="note">
      If you get an error message when you start the Instance, double check your configuration file for possible YAML syntax errors. The error message will tell you what to check.
    </Message>
3. The Instance is working now, but it cannot yet be launched automatically at boot. To achieve this, we have to create a new `systemd` configuration file that will tell your OS which services should it launch automatically during the boot process.
    ```
    nano /etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service
    ```

    The service file tells `systemd` to run Prometheus as `prometheus` and specifies the path of the configuration files.
4. Copy the following information in the file and save it, then exit the editor:
    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=Prometheus Monitoring
    Wants=network-online.target
    After=network-online.target

    [Service]
    User=prometheus
    Group=prometheus
    Type=simple
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/prometheus \
    --config.file /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
    --storage.tsdb.path /var/lib/prometheus/ \
    --web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles \
    --web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries
    ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```
5. To use the new service, reload `systemd`:
    ```
    systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

    We enable the service so that it will be loaded automatically during boot:

    ```
    systemctl enable prometheus.service
    ```
6. Start Prometheus:
    ```
    systemctl start prometheus.service
    ```

Your Prometheus Instance is ready to be used.

We have now installed Prometheus to monitor your instance.

## Prometheus Web Interface

Prometheus provides a basic web Instance running on `http://your.Instance.ip:9090` that provide access to the data collected by the software.

We can verify the status of our Prometheus Instance from the interface:

<Lightbox src="scaleway-prometheus_targets.webp" alt="" />

You can perform queries with the collected data.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-prometheus_graph.webp" alt="" />

The interface we set up is lightweight. The Prometheus team, therefore, recommends using a tool like [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) if you want to do more than testing and debugging the installation.

## Installing Grafana

1. Install Grafana on our Instance which queries our Prometheus Instance.
    ```
    apt-get install -y adduser libfontconfig1
    wget https://dl.grafana.com/oss/release/grafana_9.3.6_amd64.deb
    dpkg -i grafana_9.3.6_amd64.deb
    ```
2. Enable the automatic start of Grafana by `systemd`:
    ```
    systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl enable grafana-Instance.service && systemctl start grafana-Instance.service
    ```

Grafana is running now, and we can connect to it at `http://your.Instance.ip:3000`. The default user and password is `admin` / `admin`.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-grafana_dashboard.webp" alt="" />

Now you have to create a Prometheus data source:

- Click the cogwheel icon on the sidebar
- Click **Data Sources**
- Choose **Add data source**
- Select **Prometheus** as the data source
- Set the Prometheus Instance URL (in our case: http://localhost:9090/)
- Click **Save & test** to test the connection and to save the new data source

Your settings should look like this:

<Lightbox src="scaleway-grafana_datasource.webp" alt="" />

You are now ready to create your first dashboard from the information collected by Prometheus. You can also import some dashboards from a collection of [shared dashboards](https://grafana.com/dashboards?dataSource=prometheus)

Below is an example of a dashboard that uses the CPU usage of our node and presents it in Grafana:

<Lightbox src="scaleway-grafana_stats.webp" alt="" />
