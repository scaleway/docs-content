Local testing allows you to run your code on your development environment with a short deploy time.

Scaleway Serverless Functions can run outside Scaleway infrastructures. This is useful to set up, develop, and test functions locally. You can run functions directly on your machines to debug them and analyze logs.

Each local testing framework is written in its respective language and emulates the calls made to functions by the Scaleway infrastructure.
The result is a language-specific executable or script that users can connect to with their favorite debugging and logging tools.

## Local testing quickstarts

<Tabs id="frameworks">

<TabsTab label="NodeJS">

Refer to the [NodeJS local testing repository](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-functions-node) for more information on testing your function locally using Node.

**Quickstart**

1. Install the Scaleway Serverless Functions package using `npm`:
    ```sh
    npm i @scaleway/serverless-functions 
    ```

2. Add the following code to the file containing your handle:
  
    For ES modules
    ```js
    // handler.js

    import { pathToFileURL } from "url";

      function handle(event, context, callback) {
        return {
          statusCode: 201,
          body: JSON.stringify({
            message: "Hello World!",
          }),
          headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
          },
        };
      }

      // This part will execute when testing locally, but not when the function is deployed online
      if (import.meta.url === pathToFileURL(process.argv[1]).href) {
        import("@scaleway/serverless-functions").then(scw_fnc_node => {
          scw_fnc_node.serveHandler(handle, 8080);
        });
      }
      ```

      For common JS:
      ```js
      // handler.js

      const url = require("url");

      module.exports.handle = (event, context, callback) => {
        return {
          statusCode: 201,
          body: JSON.stringify({
            message: "Hello World!",
          }),
          headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
          },
        };
      };

      // This part will execute when testing locally, but not when the function is deployed online
      if ("file://" + __filename === url.pathToFileURL(process.argv[1]).href) {
        import("@scaleway/serverless-functions").then(scw_fnc_node => {
          scw_fnc_node.serveHandler(exports.handle, 8080);
        });
      }
      ```
3. In a terminal, run the command below to execute your file and start the local webserver:

    ```sh
    node handler.js
    ```

4. In another terminal session, run the command below:
    ```sh
    curl -X GET http://localhost:8080
    ```
  
  The function returns the content of its body:

  ```js
  {"message":"Hello World!"}%
  ```

<TabsTab label="Python">

Refer to the [Python local testing repository](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-functions-python) for more information on testing your functions locally using Python.

**Quickstart**

1. Install the Scaleway Serverless Functions package using `pip`:
    ```sh
    pip install scaleway-functions-python
    ```

2. Add the following code to the file containing your handle:

    ```python
    # handler.py

    # Standard entrypoint to a Scaleway serverless function
    def handler(event, context):
        if event["httpMethod"] != "GET":
            return {"statusCode": 405, "body": "Invalid method!"}
        return "Hello World!"

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        # The import is conditional so that you do not need
        # to package the library when deploying on Scaleway Functions.
        from scaleway_functions_python import local
        local.serve_handler(handler, port=8080)
    ```

3. In a terminal, run the command below to execute your file and start the local webserver:

    ```sh
    python handler.py
    ```

4. In another terminal session, run the command below:
    ```sh
    curl http://localhost:8080
    ```
  
    The function returns the expected output:

    ```python
    Hello World!
    ```

    <Message type="note">
    The function above only processes GET requests, as declared in its code. Other requests will return the defined error message:

    ```sh
     curl -X POST http://localhost:8080
    > Invalid method!
    ```

    </Message>

<TabsTab label="Go">

Refer to the [Go local testing repository](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-functions-go) for more information on testing your functions locally using Go.

**Quickstart**

1. Install the Scaleway Serverless Functions package using `go get`:
    ```sh
     go get github.com/scaleway/serverless-functions-go
    ```

2. In a new folder, create a file named `handler.go` and add the following code to it:
    ```go
    package handler

    import (
      "encoding/json"
      "net/http"
    )

    // This handle function comes from our examples and is not modified.
    func Handle(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
      response := map[string]any{
        "message": "We're all good",
        "healthy": true,
        "number":  4,
        "headers": r.Header,
      }

      responseBytes, err := json.Marshal(response)
      if err != nil {
        w.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)
        return
      }

      // Set the header explicitly depending the returned data
      w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")

      // Customize status code
      w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)

      // Add content to the response
      _, _ = w.Write(responseBytes)
    }
    ```

3. Create a `main.go` file in a new `cmd` subfolder, then add the following code to it:

    ```go
    package main

    import (
      // "localfunc" is the module name located in your go.mod. To generate a go.mod with "localfunc" as a name, you can use the following command : go mod init localfunc.

      // Otherwise, you can replace "localfunc" with the name of your own module.
      localfunc "github.com/scaleway/serverless-functions-go/examples/handler"
      "github.com/scaleway/serverless-functions-go/local"
    )

    func main() {
      // Replace "Handle" with your function handler name if necessary
      local.ServeHandler(localfunc.Handle, local.WithPort(8080))
    }
    ```

4. Run the commands below to generate a `mod` file, then automatically add the modules to it:

    ```sh
    go mod init localfunc && go mod tidy
    ```

5. Run the command below to create a new function for local testing:

    ```sh
    go run cmd/main.go
    ```

6. In another terminal session, run the command below:
    ```sh
    curl http://localhost:8080
    ```
  
    The function returns the expected output:

    ```json
    {
      "headers": {
        "Accept": [
          "*/*"
        ],
        "Forwarded": [
          "for=localhost:8080;proto=http"
        ],
        "K-Proxy-Request": [
          "activator"
        ],
        "User-Agent": [
          "curl/8.4.0"
        ],
        "X-Envoy-External-Address": [
          "localhost:8080"
        ],
        "X-Forwarded-For": [
          "localhost:8080",
          "127.0.0.1",
          "127.0.0.2"
        ],
        "X-Forwarded-Proto": [
          "http"
        ],
        "X-Request-Id": [
          "5283e1ee-e88e-11ef-ab6e-acde48001122"
        ]
      },
      "healthy": true,
      "message": "We're all good",
      "number": 4
    }
    ```

## Requirements

Testing your function locally will create a local web server that listens to a given port.

You need to be able to install packages with the dependency manager of the runtime you use, such as `pip`, `go get`, etc.

## Limitations

Each local testing library tries to best replicate the Serverless Functions environment, but cannot fully emulate
the surrounding infrastructure. Therefore, although being able to run your function locally is a good indicator
that it will work, it may still fail due to the execution environment used in Scaleway Serverless Functions.

The most significant difference is that, when running in Scaleway Serverless Functions, your function is packaged into a custom Docker image using our build pipeline.
This means that at runtime, your function may be launched in a different operating system,
with different libraries available to your local development environment.

Performance during local testing can differ from the deployed Serverless Functions environment, and will involve [limitations](/serverless-functions/reference-content/functions-limitations/) around resource usage and quotas.
