The intended audience of this image is Python developers who want to bootstrap or test a Python application easily, in seconds.

Common packages have been installed:

- various SCM: git, mercurial, svn
- system wide dependencies of Python package `mysql-python`
  (libmysqlclient-dev, python-dev). You can then run `pip install mysql-python`.
- system wide dependencies of Python package `psycopg2` (libpq-dev,
  python-dev). You can then run `pip install psycopg2`.
- `virtualenv`, so you can isolate your development environment

Also, a web environment is bootstrapped so you can deploy your web
application easily.

To understand why this image is useful, let's deploy a simple Django application.

## Create and start a new instance using the Python InstantApp

Follow the instructions for [creating an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance). When selecting the **image** to run on the Instance, ensure that you choose the **Python** image in the **InstantApps** tab.

## Run a Django web application

This image makes it super easy to deploy your Django application, with nginx
and uWSGI. The commands below can also be used to deploy another Python web
application.

First of all, install Django and create your project:

```bash
$> pip install django
$> cd /var/www
$> django-admin startproject my_django_project
```

Then, enable the nginx template to configure the virtualhost:

```bash
$> ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/my_website /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

Also, you need to enable the uWSGI template:

```bash
$> ln -s /etc/uwsgi/apps-available/my_django_project.ini /etc/uwsgi/apps-enabled/
```

Finally, restart services:

```bash
$> service uwsgi restart
$> service nginx restart
```

And you can open your browser and visit your IP to view your super new website!

<Message type = "important">

You may want to customize the nginx and uWSGI configuration templates we provided! We created these files only to help, because it's always a pain to setup a web stack.

## Installing a database

This image doesn't contain databases, but you can install one according to your preference:

To install MySQL, run:

```bash
$> apt-get install mysql-server
```

And/or PostgreSQL:

```bash
$> apt-get install postgresql
```
