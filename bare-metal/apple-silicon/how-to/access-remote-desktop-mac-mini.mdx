This guide provides detailed instructions on how to access your [Mac mini](/bare-metal/apple-silicon/concepts/#mac-mini) using remote desktop clients.

The macOS on your Mac mini uses the VNC protocol with additional Apple-specific enhancements to provide a remote desktop access.
Remote desktop allows you to visualize the graphical screen output of a remote computer and interact with it using your local keyboard and mouse.
The VNC protocol is platform-independent, supporting Linux, Windows, and macOS, ensuring a seamless connection experience regardless of your operating system.

- An [SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)

  <TabsTab label="macOS">
    If your local machine runs macOS, you can use the Scaleway console to connect to your Mac mini using the built-in Apple ARD client.

    1. Click **Apple Silicon** in the **Bare Metal** section of the side menu. A list of your Mac minis will be displayed.
        <Lightbox src="scaleway-apple-silicon-dashboard.webp" alt="Scaleway Apple Silicon Dashboard" />
    2. Click the Mac mini you want to connect to. The **Overview** page of your Mac mini will be displayed.
    3. Click the **VNC** button to launch a remote desktop session on your Mac mini.

        Your remote desktop client opens, and you can log in to the graphical environment of macOS using the remote user and your password (available on the **Overview** page of your Mac mini).

        <Message type="note">
          macOS may ask for your password once logged into the remote desktop session. Change the keyboard layout of macOS to your computer's local keyboard layout before entering the password. Click "U.S. keyboard" in the top right corner to display a list of all available keyboard layouts.

    You are now logged in and can use your Mac mini as if you were physically present.

### Comparison matrix of remote desktop clients

Below is a matrix to compare the different features of the free versions of these remote desktop clients:

|---------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| ARD (integrated)                | macOS         | ✅ (except for password)                   | ❌                       | ✅ auto                                           | ⭐⭐⭐                       | ⭐⭐⭐                   |
| RealVNC                         | Windows, Linux, macOS           | 〰️ (some issues)                          | ❌ (not with free version) | ❌ (manual tunnel) | ❌                         | ⭐ (not recommended)   |
| Remmina                         | Linux         | ✅ (manual, only from local to server)     | ❌                       | ❌ (manual tunnel)                               | ❌                         | ⭐                    |
| Devolutions Remote Desktop Manager | Windows, Linux, macOS       | ✅                                        | ❌                       | ✅ (requires additional setup - SSH tunnel)      | ❌                         | ⭐⭐                    |

<sup>*</sup> These remote desktop clients don't allow audio streaming. If you need audio streaming, we recommend using [Reemo](/tutorials/access-mac-mini-with-reemo/). You need to configure the connection with Reemo using a VNC connection. We recommend first setup an other VNC connection and using this remote desktop client to then configure Reemo.
