When running the `upgrade_package` command with `cloud-init` the Nvidia drivers may break causing the GPU to become unavailable. This problem persists even after a manual reboot of the Instance and the following error displays: 

```
The GPU is not usable. The driver not loaded, with the following errors in the system journal

[FAILED] Failed to start NVIDIA Persistence Daemon.
```

This error is caused by the way the `upgrade_package ` command [handles the upgrade](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/examples.html#additional-apt-configuration-and-repositories) of the packages installed on the system. It runs `apt-get dist-upgrade` instead of `apt upgrade`.

To avoid this issue, use the following `cloud-init` script with your GPU Instances:

```
#cloud-config

system_info:
apt_get_upgrade_subcommand: "upgrade"

# Upgrade the instance on first boot and reboot if needed
package_upgrade: true
package_reboot_if_required: true
```
