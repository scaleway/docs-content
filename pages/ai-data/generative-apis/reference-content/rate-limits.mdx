## What are the limits?

Any model served through Scaleway Generative APIs gets limited by:
- Tokens per minute
- Queries per minute

<Message type="tip">
These limits only apply if you created a Scaleway Account and registered a valid payment method. Otherwise, stricter limits apply to ensure usage stays within Free Tier only.
