AI-powered coding is transforming software development by automating repetitive tasks, generating code, improving code quality, and even detecting and fixing bugs. By integrating AI-driven tools, developers can significantly boost productivity and streamline their workflows. 
This guide provides a step-by-step guide on how to integrate AI-powered code models into VS Code using Continue and Scaleway's Generative APIs.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) for API authentication
- Installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on your local machine

## Install Continue in VS Code

You can install Continue directly from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue) or via the command line:

```bash
code --install-extension continue.continue
```

### Configure Continue to use Scaleway’s Generative APIs

#### Configure Continue through the graphical interface

To link Continue with Scaleway's Generative APIs, you can use built-in menus from Continue in VS Code.

- Click **Continue** in the menu on the left.
- In the prompt section, click on **Select model** dropdown, then on **Add Chat model**.
- Select **Scaleway** as provider.
- Select the model you want to use (we recommend `Qwen 2.5 Coder 32b` to get started with).
- Enter your **Scaleway secret key**.
    <Message type="tip">
     To start with, we recommend you use a Scaleway secret key having access to your `default` Scaleway project.
    </Message>

These actions will edit automatically your `config.json` file. To edit it manually, see [Configure Continue through configuration file](#configure-continue-through-configuration-file).

<Message type="note">
  Embeddings and autocomplete models are not yet supported through graphical interface configuration. To enable them, you need to edit the configuration manually, see [Configure Continue through configuration file](#configure-continue-through-configuration-file).
</Message>

#### Configure Continue through a configuration file

To link Continue with Scaleway's Generative APIs, you can configure a settings file:

- Create a `config.json` file inside your `.continue` directory.
- Add the following configuration to enable Scaleway's Generative API:
    ```json
    {
      "models": [
        {
          "model": "qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct",
          "title": "Qwen2.5 Coder",
          "provider": "scaleway",
          "apiKey": "###SCW_SECRET_KEY###"
        }
      ],
      "embeddingsProvider": {
        "model": "bge-multilingual-gemma2",
        "provider": "scaleway",
        "apiKey": "###SCW_SECRET_KEY###"
      },
      "tabAutocompleteModel": {
        "model": "qwen2.5-coder-32b",
        "title": "Qwen2.5 Coder Autocomplete",
        "provider": "scaleway",
        "apiKey": "###SCW_SECRET_KEY###"
      }
    }
    ```
- Save the file at the correct location:
  - Linux/macOS: `~/.continue/config.json`
  - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.continue\config.json`

<Message type="tip">
  For more details on configuring `config.json`, refer to the [official Continue documentation](https://docs.continue.dev/reference).
  If you want to limit access to a specific Scaleway Project, you should add the field `"apiBase": "https://api.scaleway.ai/###PROJECT_ID###/v1/"` for each model (ie. `models`, `embeddingsProvider` and `tabAutocompleteModel`) since the default URL `https://api.scaleway.ai/v1/` can only be used with the `default` project.

### Activate Continue in VS Code

After configuring the API, open VS Code and activate Continue:

- Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
- Type `"Continue"` and select the appropriate command to enable AI-powered assistance.

<Message type="important">
  Enabling tab completion **may lead to higher token consumption** as the model generates predictions for every keystroke. Be mindful of your API usage and adjust settings accordingly to avoid unexpected costs. For more information, refer to the [official Continue documentation](https://docs.continue.dev/reference#tabautocompleteoptions).
</Message>

### Going further

You can add additional parameters to configure your model behaviour by editing `config.json`.
For instance, you can add the following `systemMessage` value to modify LLM messages `"role":"system"` and/or `"role":"developer"` and provide less verbose answers:
```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "model": "...",
      "systemMessage": "You are an expert software developer. You give concise responses."
    }
  ]
}
```
