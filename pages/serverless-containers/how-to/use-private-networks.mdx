[Private Networks](/serverless-containers/concepts/#private-networks) allow your Serverless Containers to communicate in an isolated and secure network without needing to be connected to the public internet. Each container can be connected to one or several Private Networks, letting you build your own network topologies.

For full information about Scaleway Private Networks and VPC, see our [dedicated documentation](/vpc/) and [best practices guide](/vpc/reference-content/getting-most-private-networks/).

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a Private Network](/vpc/how-to/create-private-network/)


## How to create a Private Network

This action must be carried out from the Private Networks section of the console. Follow the procedure detailed in our [dedicated Private Networks documentation](/vpc/how-to/create-private-network/).
