## Retrieving content using a Kubo client

Once your content is pinned on our service, you can retrieve it via any other [Kubo client](/labs/ipfs-pinning/api-cli/ipfs-cli/), compatible with Linux, Mac, and Windows.

1. Run the following CLI command to initialize your local IPFS node:

    ```
      ipfs init
    ```

2. Run the following CLI command to launch the IPFS background process, effectively turning your device into a functioning node in the IPFS network:

    ```
    ipfs daemon
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
        If you wish to use the same terminal for future commands, you need to run `ipfs daemon &`. This will run the daemon in the background and return control to the terminal.
    </Message>

3. Run the following command to fetch your content using its CID and store it in a file. Make sure to replace the example values with your own:

    ```
    ipfs get <YOUR_PINNED_CID> > myFile
    ```
    <Message type="note">
        Your content will be stored in a file called `myFile`.
    </Message>

## Retrieving content using an HTTP gateway

There are different ways to access data over the HTTP or HTTPS protocols. You can either use a web browser or the [curl](https://curl.se/) command.

Paste the following link into your web browser to retrieve public content via an IPFS gateway. Make sure to replace the example value with your own:

```
https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<YOUR_PINNED_CID>
```

Alternatively, run the following `curl` command to retrieve it via a local client. Also make sure to replace the example value with your own:

```
curl https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<YOUR_PINNED_CID>
```

## Retrieving content using a Go client

You can also retrieve pinned content via the Go program. To do so, we recommend using the official [kubo client rpc](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/tree/master/client/rpc).

In this case, you need to run an IPFS node (like Kubo) to perform operations with the IPFS network.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"github.com/ipfs/boxo/files"
	"github.com/ipfs/kubo/client/rpc"
	"github.com/ipfs/kubo/core/commands/cmdutils"
)

func main() {
	// Create an IPFS RPC client for the local API
	api, err := rpc.NewLocalApi()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error creating IPFS RPC client:", err)
		return
	}

	// CID of the content you want to retrieve
	cid := "<YOUR_PINNED_CID>"

	// Convert the CID to a path
	p, err := cmdutils.PathOrCidPath(cid)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error resolving path:", err)
		return
	}

	// Send get command to ipfs node
	ctx := context.Background()
	file, err := api.Unixfs().Get(ctx, p)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error getting content:", err)
		return
	}

	// Write the content to the file
	err = files.WriteTo(file, "myFile")
	if err != nil {
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	// Write the content to the file with cid filename by default
	//res := files.ToFile(file)
}
```
