The **notification manager** allows you to configure different types of notifications about Organization events, for the users in your Organization. These events include incidents, technical issues or maintenance, security alerts and billing. The notification manager also provides shortcuts to your [Budget alerts](/billing/how-to/use-billing-alerts/), [Cockpit alerts](/cockpit/how-to/enable-alert-manager/), and the Scaleway [status page](https://status.scaleway.com/).

## How to notify users in your Organization

1. Open the **Settings** page of your Organization.
2. Scroll down to the [User notification](https://console.scaleway.com/settings/organization/notifications#notifications-user) section of the side menu, under **Organization notifications**.
3. Check the box(es) next to the email of the user for whom you want to set up notifications. Four [types of notifications](#types-of-notifications) are available: **Incident**, **Technical**, **Security**, and **Billing**.
    <Message type="note">
      The emails displayed in the list belong to users in your Organization. [Create a new Member](/iam/how-to/manage-members/#how-to-create-a-member) to see them on the list and manage their notification settings.
    </Message>

When you check the box, the user is automatically subscribed to the notifications.

<Message type="note">
  You can uncheck the box(es) to unsubscribe a user from notifications.
</Message>

### Types of notifications

The notification manager lets you decide who receives each type of notification. Here are some examples of the different types of notifications:

| **Notification type** | **Examples**                                                 |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Incident              | Service downtime detected, outage resolved                   |
| Technical             | Scheduled maintenance, update required                       |
| Security              | Suspicious login attempt detected, MFA activated/deactivated |
| Billing               | New invoice sent, credit card expired                        |

## How to notify users outside of your Organization

1. Navigate to the **External notifications** section.
2. Click the **Add contact** button.
3. Enter the contact’s **name** and **email address**.
4. Click **Select notification type**.
5. Check boxes for the [notification types](/account/how-to/manage-notifications/#types-of-notifications) the contact should receive (e.g., Incident, Billing).
6. Click **Add contact** to confirm.
