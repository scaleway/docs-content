Openclaw is an agent framework that enables advanced AI workflows, including multi-agent coordination, tool usage, and channel-based communication. You can integrate Openclaw with Generative APIs models to build a personal AI assistant that send emails and manage your calendar.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) for API authentication
- Installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) >= 22.22.0 on your local machine
- Installed [Openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) on your local machine

## Configure Openclaw

After installing Openclaw, a `.openclaw` directory is created in your local user directory (`~/.openclaw`). Configure Openclaw to use Scaleway's Generative APIs:

1. Rename the default configuration file `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json.old`
    ````
     mv ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json.old
     ````
2. Create a new `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` file with the following content:


   ```json
   {
     "models": {
       "mode": "merge",
       "providers": {
         "custom-proxy": {
           "baseUrl": "https://api.scaleway.ai/v1",
           "apiKey": "{SCW_SECRET_KEY}",
           "auth": "api-key",
           "api": "openai-completions",
           "authHeader": true,
           "models": [
             {
               "id": "devstral-2-123b-instruct-2512",
               "name": "Devstral 2 - SCW",
               "api": "openai-completions",
               "reasoning": false,
               "input": [
                 "text"
               ],
               "cost": {
                 "input": 0.4,
                 "output": 2,
                 "cacheRead": 0,
                 "cacheWrite": 0
               },
               "contextWindow": 128000,
               "maxTokens": 8192,
               "compat": {
                 "maxTokensField": "max_completion_tokens"
               }
             }
           ]
         }
       }
     },
     "agents": {
       "defaults": {
         "model": {
           "primary": "custom-proxy/devstral-2-123b-instruct-2512"
         },
         "workspace": "/Users/{USER_NAME}/.openclaw/workspace",
         "compaction": {
           "mode": "safeguard"
         },
         "maxConcurrent": 4,
         "subagents": {
           "maxConcurrent": 8
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   - Replace `{SCW_SECRET_KEY}` with your Scaleway IAM secret key.
   - Replace `/Users/{USER_NAME}` with the path to your `.openclaw` folder. You can find this path using:
     ```bash
     echo ~
     ```

3. Run the following command to continue Openclaw configuration:
   ```bash
   openclaw onboard
   ```
   - Read risks carefully and select **Yes** if you understand them.
   - For onboarding mode, choose **Quickstart**.
   - For config handling, select **Use existing values**.
   - For model authentication provider, select **Skip for now**.
   - For filter models by providers, select `custom-proxy`. If this option does not appear, ensure `openclaw.json` is correctly configured and in the right location.
   - For default model, select **Keep current** (should display `custom-proxy/devstral-2-123b-instruct-2512`).
   - For channel configuration, select `Skip for now channel configuration for now (unless you want to set one up, such as Discord).
   - For skills, select **Skip for now**.
   - For hooks, select **Skip for now**.
   - If the Gateway service is already installed and configuration displays, select **Restart**.
   - For how do you want to hatch your bot, select **Hatch in TUI**.

4. The Openclaw dashboard initial conversation displays in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:18789/overview` and your terminal. You can also start it with:
     ```bash
     openclaw dashboard
     ```
     The initial conversation should display:
     ```
     Hey! I just came online. Who am I? Who are you? Let's figure this out together.
     ```
   
You can now send message to the agent and ask it to perform some actions.

## Using Openclaw with a Channel

1. You can configure Openclaw to access a discord channel with:
  ```bash
  openclaw channels add
  ```
  and following the instructions.

2. Once you have configured a Discord channel, you can send messages using:
  ```bash
  openclaw message send --channel discord --target example828494791929 --message "Hi from Openclaw"
  ```
  Replace `example828494791929` with your Discord channel ID.

  Alternatively, you can instruct the bot to send messages via chat, such as:
  ```bash
  "Send a welcome message in the form of a poem about lobsters to Discord channel example828494791929"
  ```

## Going Further

- Customize your configuration based on [Generative APIs' supported models](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/generative-apis/reference-content/supported-models/) (model, context size...)
- Explore additional channels and skills. Ensure you understand the security implications and limit permissions before enabling new features.
- Run Openclaw in an isolated environment on [Apple Silicon](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/apple-silicon/quickstart/) for additional security or local LLM execution.
