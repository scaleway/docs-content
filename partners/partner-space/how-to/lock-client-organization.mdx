If you are confronted with a client who does not respect Scalewayâ€™s Terms of Service, you can lock their Organization. 

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- Scaleway Partner status
- [Added a client](/partners/partner-space/how-to/add-client/)
 
 <Message type="important">
     Locking an Organization prevents its owner from ordering or managing resources.
    </Message>

1. Go to the Partner Space. A list of your clients displays. 
2. Locate the row corresponding to the client whose Organization you want to lock.  
3. Click <Icon name="more" /> at the end of the row. 
4. Click **Lock Organization**. A pop-up displays.
5. Type **LOCK** in the text area.
6. Click **Lock** to confirm.
