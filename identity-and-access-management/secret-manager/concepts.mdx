## Folder

Folders are the underlying structure for organizing and grouping your secrets in one place. Folders are always within a [path](#path).

## Path

A path refers to the directory structure to access your folders and secrets. Paths contain your folders, subfolders, secrets, and versions. Each path is prefixed with a slash.

For example, if you create a folder `my-folder` within the path `/my-path`, your folder can be accessed at the `/my-path/my-folder` path.

<Message type="important">
  - A path can only contain folder names of 1 to 255 alphanumeric characters (per folder), dots, underscores, and dashes.
  - If you leave the path name field empty when creating your folders or secrets, the default path will be `/`. Your folders and secrets will be stored under the `/` path.

## PEM

A PEM or **Privacy Enhanced Mail** file is a security certificate file used to establish a secure communication channel between a web server and a browser. It is encoded in Base64 and may contain a private key, a server certificate and/or a combination of other certificates.

## Region

A region is the geographical area in which your folders, secrets, and versions are stored and run. They are duplicated on all [Availability Zones](/compute/instances/concepts/#availability-zone) of the selected region (Paris, Amsterdam, or Warsaw).

Secret Manager allows you to select your resources by region. This allows you to better sort through your resources, if you have created them in different regions but with the same name, for example.

## Secret

Secrets are logical containers made up of zero or more immutable versions, that hold sensitive data.

## Secret Manager

Secret Manager is a solution that provides a centralized location where your secrets can be stored and accessed. Its primary purpose is to securely store secrets, thus eliminating the need for developers to hard code sensitive information in applications or configuration files.

With Secret Manager, you can also share sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, and certificates.

Scaleway's Secret Manager can be managed using [APIs](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/secret-manager/) and the Scaleway [CLI](https://www.scaleway.com/en/cli/), which allow authorized applications or services to retrieve secrets securely. This enables you to automate a deployment by fetching your passwords stored on Secret Manager through the API, and storing them in your environment variables, which will then be used by your application.

## Secret protection

Secret protection is a feature that prevents the deletion of your secrets. Users holding the `SecretManagerFullAccess`, `SecretManagerSecretWrite`, and `AllProductsFullAccess` [permission sets](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/) can enable it, ensuring that although your secrets can be accessed and modified, they remain **impossible to delete**.
This ensures the protection of critical information against accidental deletion while maintaining secret management flexibility.

## Tag

Tags allow you to organize your secrets. This gives you the possibility of sorting and filtering your secrets in any organizational pattern of your choice, which in turn helps you arrange, control and monitor your secrets.

## Version

Versions store the data contained in your secret (API keys, passwords, or certificates).
