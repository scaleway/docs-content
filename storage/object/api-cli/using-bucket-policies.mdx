## How to apply a bucket policy

1. Create the `bucket-policy.json` file in your environment using a text editor, such as `nano` or `vim`. You can edit the contents of the configuration according to your preference. Refer to [Understanding bucket policies](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/) for more details about each string. 
    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Id": "MyBucketPolicy",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "DelegateAccess",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": {
                    "SCW": "project_id:<PROJECT_ID>"
                },
                "Action": [
                    "s3:ListBucket",
                    "s3:GetObject"
                ],
                "Resource": [
                    "<BUCKET_NAME>",
                    "<BUCKET_NAME>/*"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
2. Run the command below to apply the policy. Replace `<BUCKET_NAME>` by the name of your bucket. 
    ```
    aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket <BUCKET_NAME> --policy file://bucket-policy.json
    ```

## How to import a copy of objects from a bucket in a different project

Import a copy of your objects in a bucket to another bucket using the [AWS-CLI](/storage/object/api-cli/object-storage-aws-cli/).

See [related content](/storage/object/api-cli/import-copy/).

## How to manage bucket permissions for IP addresses or ranges of IP

You can stipulate which IP addresses or IP ranges have access or permission to perform S3 operations on your buckets by creating a [bucket policy](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/) with the `IpAddress` or `NotIpAddress` conditions. 

See [related content](/storage/object/api-cli/manage-bucket-permissions-IP/).

## How to share buckets in read-only mode

It is possible to implement a [bucket policy](/storage/object/api-cli/bucket-policy/) to grant a Scaleway organization or project viewing rights to a bucket in a different project. 

See [related content](/storage/object/api-cli/share-buckets-read-only/).
