Creating an Edge Services pipeline for your Load Balancer helps to reduce load on your Load Balancer's backend servers. The origin configuration you define is used by Edge Services to connect to your Load Balancer and request content, which is then stored in the cache. Then, when your Load Balancer origin is accessed via its customizable Edge Services endpoint, the requested content is served from the cache (if present), without the need to fetch this content via the Load Balancer and its backend servers.

The user connects to the customizable Edge Services endpoint (with its SSL/TLS certificate), which fetches content from the Edge Services cache, which itself fetches content to cache from an origin which is either an Object Storage bucket or Load Balancer" />

Edge Services lets you:

- Define the specific origin (Load Balancer, frontend port, and host) for a given pipeline and its associated cache
- Choose the TTL for cached objects, and purge the entire cache or specific cached objects at any time (cache invalidation)
- Configure a [Web Application Firewall (WAF)](/edge-services/how-to/configure-waf/) to protect your origin from threats and malicious activity
- Customize your Edge Services pipeline endpoint using a subdomain of your own domain
- Add an SSL/TLS certificate so that Edge Services can serve content over HTTPS for your subdomain

An Edge Services pipeline can be created for any Load Balancer with a public IP address. Load Balancers with frontends/backends using both TCP and/or HTTP are supported. [Private Load Balancers](/load-balancer/reference-content/public-private-accessibility/#private-load-balancers) are not compatible with Edge Services.
