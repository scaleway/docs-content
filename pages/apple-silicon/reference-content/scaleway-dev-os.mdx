Dev OS is a developer-optimized operating system based on a recent version of macOS (Dev OS 15 is based on macOS Sequoia). It comes pre-configured with a curated set of development tools, runtimes, and dependencies aligned with the software stack used in GitHub Actions runner images.

## Pre-installed software & developer tooling

Dev OS ships with a complete set of development tools and packages, including Apache, Xcode, web browsers, multiple programming language runtimes, SDKs, and more.  
Choosing Dev OS eliminates the need for time-consuming manual installations. All installed components closely follow the configuration of the [GitHub Actions macOS-15 runner image](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/macos/macos-15-Readme.md), ensuring consistency between environments.

<Message type="important">
  Although all software is pre-installed, **users are responsible for configuring tools according to their specific needs** (e.g., setting default Python versions, initializing Homebrew, configuring Git credentials, enabling Apache modules) and for **keeping this software up to date**.
</Message>

This ready-to-use toolkit typically saves developers **6–10+ hours** of initial setup time and helps prevent configuration drift across teams.

## Disk space requirements

Because Dev OS includes a large number of tools, runtimes, and dependencies, the system has a **base footprint of approximately 270 GB**.

<Message type="note">
  Keep in mind:
  - Available user storage is significantly reduced compared to standard macOS installations.
  - Dev OS is not compatible with Mac minis offering less than **512 GB** of storage.
</Message>

## Kernel extension support & system integrity

Dev OS is configured to support specific **whitelisted kernel extensions (KEXTs)** to enable advanced development and file system use cases.

- **MacFUSE support is enabled**, allowing users to mount custom file systems (e.g., cloud storage, encrypted volumes, or distributed file systems).
- Unlike standard macOS deployments, **no reboot into Recovery Mode is required** to approve or load these extensions.
- Apple’s System Integrity Protection (SIP) remains enabled; approved KEXTs are pre-authorized through configuration profiles.

<Message type="note">
  Full documentation on installing and using MacFUSE will be published soon. This functionality is particularly useful for developers working with remote file systems or custom storage backends.

## Software licensing & user agreement

By requesting and using a Dev OS machine, users acknowledge and agree to the **license terms of all pre-installed software**.

This includes, but is not limited to:
- Apple’s Xcode and macOS software licenses
- Open-source licenses (MIT, GPL, Apache, etc.) for tools such as Homebrew, Node.js, and Python
- Third-party SDKs and binaries distributed via their official sources

Users **must comply** with all applicable licensing terms. Scaleway is not responsible for misuse or non-compliance with third-party software licenses.
