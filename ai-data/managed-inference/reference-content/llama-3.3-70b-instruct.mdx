## Model introduction

Released December 6, 2024, Meta’s Llama 3.3 70b is a fine-tune of the [Llama 3.1 70b](/ai-data/managed-inference/reference-content/llama-3.1-70b) model.
This model is still text-only (text in/text out). However, Llama 3.3 was designed to approach the performance of Llama 3.1 405B on some applications.

## Why is it useful?

- Llama 3.3 uses the same prompt format as Llama 3.1. Prompts written for Llama 3.1 work unchanged with Llama 3.3. 
- Llama 3.3 supports 7 languages in addition to English: French, German, Hindi, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Thai

## How to use it

### Sending Managed Inference requests

To perform inference tasks with your Llama-3.3 deployed at Scaleway, use the following command:

```bash
curl -s \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <IAM API key>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--request POST \
--url "https://<Deployment UUID>.ifr.fr-par.scaleway.com/v1/chat/completions" \
--data '{"model":"meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:bf16", "messages":[{"role": "user","content": "There is a llama in my garden, what should I do?"}], "max_tokens": 500, "temperature": 0.7, "stream": false}'
```

Make sure to replace `<IAM API key>` and `<Deployment UUID>` with your actual [IAM API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) and the Deployment UUID you are targeting.

<Message type="tip">
  The model name allows Scaleway to put your prompts in the expected format.
</Message>

<Message type="note">
  Ensure that the `messages` array is properly formatted with roles (system, user, assistant) and content.
</Message>

### Receiving Inference responses

Upon sending the HTTP request to the public or private endpoints exposed by the server, you will receive inference responses from the managed Managed Inference server. 
Process the output data according to your application's needs. The response will contain the output generated by the LLM model based on the input provided in the request.
