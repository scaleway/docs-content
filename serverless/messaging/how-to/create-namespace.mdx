This page shows how to create a [Messaging and Queuing namespace](/serverless/messaging/concepts#namespace). Two types of namespaces are available: [NATS](/serverless/messaging/concepts#nats) and [SQS/SNS](/serverless/messaging/concepts#sqssns). The type of namespace that you choose determines the messaging system used to distribute and queue your messages.

## How to create a namespace

1. Click **Messaging** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The Messaging and Queuing namespace creation page displays.
2. Click **Create namespace**. The namespace creation wizard displays.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard:
    - Choose a **region**, which is the geographical region in which your namespace will be created.
    - Choose a namespace **type**. The namespace type determines the message system used to distribute and queue your messages. Currently, two types are available:
        - **NATS**: Choose this namespace type if you want to use the [NATS](/serverless/messaging/concepts#nats) messaging system. When you later create credentials, they will be scoped at the namespace level and give full access to all streams related to the namespace.
        - **SQS/SNS**: Choose this namespace type if you want to use the [SQS](/serverless/messaging/concepts#sqssns) and/or [SNS](/serverless/messaging/concepts#sns) messaging systems. When you later create credentials, they will be scoped at the namespace level and you can select the required level of access (read/write/manage) for each set of credentials. 
    - Choose a **name** for your namespace, or use the randomly-generated name suggested.
4. Click **Create namespace** to finish.

    Your namespace is created. You are taken to the list of all your namespaces, where your newly-created namespace now appears.
