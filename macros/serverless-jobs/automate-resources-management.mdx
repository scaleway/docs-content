[Scaleway Serverless Jobs](/serverless-jobs/quickstart/) allows you to create and automate recurring tasks. This page shows how to create jobs to perform any operation available with the [Scaleway CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/blob/master/docs/commands/config.md) to automate the management of your Scaleway resources.

<Message type="note">
To automate complex commands, such as piped or `xargs` commands, refer to the [dedicated documentation](/serverless-jobs/how-to/execute-complex-commands/).
</Message>

Serverless Jobs are perfectly adapted for these autonomous tasks, as we do not need autoscaling or exposure via a web server. Refer to the [documentation on differences between jobs, containers, and functions](/serverless-jobs/reference-content/difference-jobs-functions-containers/) for more information.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com).
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization.

## Creating the job definition

1. In the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com), click **Jobs** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The jobs page displays.

2. Click **Create job**. The job creation wizard displays.

3. For **Container Image**, select **External**, and in **Image URL**, set: `scaleway/cli:latest`.

4. Enter a name or use the automatically generated one.

5. Select the region in which your job will be created.

6. Keep the default **resources** values, as this job requires little compute capability.

7. Set a **cron schedule** in the `* * * * *` format (such as `0 0 * * *` to run the job every day at midnight), and select the relevant time zone to run the job at the desired frequency. Refer to the [cron schedules documentation](/serverless-jobs/reference-content/cron-schedules/) for more information.

8. Define the following environment variables:
    - `SCW_ACCESS_KEY`: your API access key.
    - `SCW_SECRET_KEY`: your API secret key.
    - `SCW_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID`: your Project ID.
    - `SCW_DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ID`: your Organization ID.
    - `SCW_DEFAULT_REGION`: desired region.

    <Message type="note">
        We recommend using [Secret Manager](/secret-manager/quickstart/) to store the `SCW_ACCESS_KEY` and `SCW_SECRET_KEY`.
    </Message>

    For more details about variables used by `cli`, refer to the [CLI config documentation](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/blob/master/docs/commands/config.md).

9. In the **Execution** tab, define the desired Scaleway CLI command, as shown in the examples below:
    - **Power Instances on and off**
        ```bash
        # Power on
        /scw instance server start 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111

        # Power off
        /scw instance server stop 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
        ```
    - **Create a snapshot of an Instance volume**
        ```bash
        /scw instance snapshot create volume-id=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
        ```
    - **Create a backup of an Instance**
        ```bash
        /scw instance server backup 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
        ```
10. Click **Create job**.

Your Serverless Job will run the command periodically according to the [cron schedule](/serverless-jobs/reference-content/cron-schedules/) you defined.

## Running the job

From the **Overview** tab of the Serverless Job you just created, click **Actions**, then select **Run job** from the contextual menu.

The execution appears in the **Job runs** section. You can access the logs of your job by clicking <Icon name="more" /> next to the job run ID, and selecting **See on Cockpit**.
