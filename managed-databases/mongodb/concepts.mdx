## Block Storage Low Latency

Block Storage Low Latency is a storage type similar to [Basic Block Storage](#basic-block-storage) that provides lower latency and high resiliency through 5k IOPS. You can increase your volume size to up to 10 TB.

Refer to the [Block Storage Low Latency documentation section](/storage/block/concepts/) to learn more about this volume type.

<Message type="note">
  Block Low Latency volumes are only available with new-generation node types and in the PAR and AMS regions.

## Database Instance

A Database Instance is made up of multiple (at least 1) dedicated compute nodes, and is running a single Database Engine. Exactly one database engine is running on each node.

## Database snapshot

A [Snapshot](/managed-databases/document-database/how-to/manage-snapshots/) is a consistent, instantaneous copy of the Block Storage volume of your Database Instance at a certain point in time. They are designed to recover your data in case of failure or accidental alterations of the data by a user. They allow you to quickly create a new Instance from a previous state of your database, regardless of the size of the volume. Snapshots can only be stored in the same location as the original data.

## Document database

Document databases enable users to store and retrieve data in a document format, such as json. Compared to traditional relational databases where data is stored in a table-like format, document-type storage supports storing multiple nested keys and values in each document key.

## Endpoint

A point of connection to a database. The endpoint is associated with an IPv4 address and a port, and determines whether the endpoint is read-write or not.

## Engine

A database engine is the software component that stores and retrieves your data from a database. Currently, FerretDB 1.2.0 is available. It runs on PostgreSQL 14.8. Users do not have direct access to the PostgreSQL layer when using FerretDB.

## Logs

Logs can contain useful information for debugging or to know more about the behavior and activity of your databases.

## Managed Database

Compared to traditional database management, which requires customers to provision their infrastructure and resources to manage their databases, managed databases offer the user access to a Database Instance without setting up the hardware or configuring the software.

## Region and Availability Zone

## Replica-set 1-node

An Instance of MongoDB™ that runs as a single server and does not provide redundancy or high availability.

## Replica-set 3-nodes

A group of 3 MongoDB™ servers (1 primary and 2 standby nodes) that maintain the same data set. Replica sets provide redundancy and high availability and are the basis for all production deployments. If the main node fails for any reason, one of the remaining standby nodes is assigned and can take over requests, reducing downtime.
