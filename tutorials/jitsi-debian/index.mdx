[Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/) is a free and fully encrypted open source video conferencing service solution providing high quality and audio without subscription or the need to create an account which can be installed easily on a virtual instance, running on [Debian 10 Buster](https://www.debian.org).

The tool provides features like:

- Sharing of desktops, presentations, and more
- Inviting users to a conference via a simple, custom URL
- Editing documents together using Etherpad
- Trading messages and emojis while video conferencing, with integrated chat.

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your SSH Key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
  - You have a [Scaleway Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) running Debian Buster (for a better performance, we recommend that you use an instance with **at least 4 GB of RAM** - DEV1-M or larger)
  - You have a domain or subdomain pointed to your Instance

### Installing Jitsi Meet

1. Configure the hostname of the server corresponding to your domain / subdomain name:

  ```
  hostnamectl set-hostname jitsi
  sed -i 's/^127.0.1.1.*$/127.0.1.1 jitsi.mydomain.tld jitsi/g' /etc/hosts
  sed -i 's/^127.0.0.1.*$/127.0.0.1 localhost jitsi.mydomain.tld jitsi/g' /etc/hosts
  ```

2. Update the apt packet cache and upgrade the software installed on the instance to the latest version available on the Debian repositories:

  ```
  apt update && apt upgrade
  ```

3. Install a [Nginx](https://nginx.org) web server before installing Jitsi Meet. The Jitsi installation tool will take care about the configuration of Nginx, if it is present on the system. Run the following commands to install and enable Nginx:

  ```
  apt install -y nginx
  systemctl start nginx.service
  systemctl enable nginx.service
  ```

  <Message type="important">

    If Nginx or Apache are not installed, Jitsi Meet will automatically install [Jetty](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) during the installation.

4. Download the APT key and setup the repositories of Jitsi, to install the software via `apt`:

  ```
  wget -qO - https://download.jitsi.org/jitsi-key.gpg.key | apt-key add -
  sh -c "echo 'deb https://download.jitsi.org stable/' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jitsi-stable.list"
  apt update
  ```

5. Launch the installation of Jitsi Meet:

  ```
  apt install -y jitsi-meet
  ```

  When asked, enter:

    - The FQDN of your instance. For example `jitsi.mydomain.tld` and press Enter.
    - When asked about the SSL certificate choose the `Generate a new self-signed certificate (You will later get a chance to obtain a Let's Encrypt certificate)` option and press Enter.

6. Run the following script to generate a [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) SSL certificate for your instance:

  ```
  /usr/share/jitsi-meet/scripts/install-letsencrypt-cert.sh
  ```

  <Message type="tip">

    In case the Let's Encrypt certificate generation fails, run the following command: `dpkg-reconfigure jitsi-meet-web-config` to reconfigure the package `jitsi-meet-web-config` before relaunching the certificate request.

  </Message>

  The Jitsi Meet instance is configured and ready for a first conference call.

7. Open a Web-browser and type the FQDN of your instance, for example: `https://jitsi.mydomain.tld`. The following screen will appear:

8. Enter a name for your conference and press `Go` to enter the conference room. It is now possible to share the link, to set a password, configure the audio and video quality and more for the conference.

9. Happy conferencing :)
