You can now generate and download annual environmental footprint reports directly from the Scaleway console or via the API. The report provides a consolidated overview of your infrastructure's carbon emissions and water usage for the previous calendar year.

This feature provides quick access to a downloadable PDF summary, supports ESG and CSRD  (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) compliance by providing structured environmental data, and allows you to track your infrastructure's environmental performance over time. 

The report is available for all active projects and covers the full previous year. Access it now in the [**Environmental Footprint** section](https://console.scaleway.com/environmental-footprint/reports) of the console.
