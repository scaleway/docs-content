This page shows you how to change the [retention](/cockpit/concepts/#retention) period for your data sources. Refer to the [Cockpit FAQ](/cockpit/faq/) for detailed information on pricing.

<Message type="note">
 **Pricing update for Cockpit custom retention** <br /><br />

 On January 1st, 2025, Cockpit pricing plans were deprecated and replaced by the custom [retention](/cockpit/concepts/#retention) feature, available for free during beta.
 On May 1st, 2025, this feature reaches general availability and **becomes billable**. <br /><br />

 **Logs and traces**: free retention for 7 days, then charged €0.002/GB/day

 **Metrics**: free retention for 31 days, then charged €0.0002/10 million samples/day

 Ingestion of custom data remains billable at [the current pricing](/cockpit/faq/#how-am-i-billed-for-using-cockpit-with-custom-data).

         - Reducing the retention period of a data source will permanently delete all observability data in that data source beyond the selected timeframe. This deletion is irreversible and takes effect a few minutes after the retention period is reduced, even if the retention period is later increased.
