[mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) lets you publish modern online books, for product, API documentation, tutorials, course material or anything that requires a clean, easily navigable, and customizable presentation.

This tutorial uses `mdbook` to publish simple documentation but the main goal of this tutorial is to show how simple it is to pick a project, package it inside an image, and deploy it on Serverless Containers.

<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed on your local machine

## Why deploy on a Serverless infrastructure?

Serverless products are perfect for cost efficiency with a pay-as-you-go model, and scale very well.

With zero infrastructure management and many tools to integrate in CI/CD environments, an `mdBook` deployment is well suited to Serverless Containers.

## Setting up mdBook locally

1. Follow the [installation instructions](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html) of mdBook.

2. Run the following command to create a sample book:
    ```
    mdbook init my-first-books
    ```

3. Run the following command to access the folder created by the previous `init` command:
    ```
    cd my-first-book
    ```

4. Optionally, you can edit the content of the book to publish.

5. Test the book using the command below:
    ```
    mdbook test
    ```

## Preparing the Container Registry

<Message type="note">
  We recommend using [Scaleway Container Registry](/container-registry/) instead of external registries to avoid rate limiting errors, and risks linked to CGU and pricing changes.
</Message>

1. Create a file named `Dockerfile` in the previously created folder, and add the following code to it:

    ```docker
    FROM debian:bookworm-slim

    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy the necessary files (add your custom files here)
    COPY book.toml /app/
    COPY src/* /app/src/

    # Install the mdbooks binary
    RUN apt-get -y update; apt-get -y install curl;
    RUN mkdir /home/mdbooks
    RUN curl -sSL https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/releases/download/v0.4.40/mdbook-v0.4.40-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz | tar -xz --directory=/home/mdbooks
    ENV PATH="$PATH:/home/mdbooks"

    # Serve the book
    # 0.0.0.0 is required to listen on public interface, otherwise mdbook will only listen for localhost
    # 8080 port is used to match the Serverless Container settings.
    ENTRYPOINT ["mdbook", "serve", "-n", "0.0.0.0", "-p", "8080" ]
    ```

2. Open the Scaleway console in a web browser, and navigate to the [Container Registry](https://console.scaleway.com/containers/).

3. Click **+ Create namespace**. [Namespaces](/container-registry/concepts/#namespace) allow you to easily manage the images stored in your Container Registry.

4. Enter a name for your namespace, or keep the automatically generated one, then click **Create namespace**.

<Message type="note">
  For more information on creating a Container Registry namespace, refer to [the dedicated documentation](/container-registry/how-to/create-namespace/).

## Building and pushing the image

<Message type="note">
Remember to replace the placeholders with the corresponding values in the steps below.
</Message>

1. Run the following command in a terminal to sign in to your Container Registry namespace:
    ```
    docker login rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/<namespace_name> -u nologin --password-stdin <<< "$SCW_SECRET_KEY"
    ```
    The message `Login Succeeded` appears once you are signed in.

2. Run the command below to build and tag your image locally.

    ```
    docker build -t rg.<region>.scw.cloud/<namespace_name>/<image_name>:<tag_name> .
    ```

    * The **region** and **namespace_name** can be found in the **Namespace settings** tab of the namespace you created.
    * **image_name**: use the name you want to identify your image, such as `my-mdbook`.
    * **tag_name**: use tags to identify the version of your image, such as `v1`.

3. Run the command below to push the image to the Scaleway Container Registry:
    ```
    docker push rg.<region>.scw.cloud/<namespace>/<image_name>:<tag>
    ```

## Deploying the Serverless Container

1. In the [Serverless Containers](https://console.scaleway.com/containers/namespaces/) section of the Scaleway console, click **+ Create namespace**.

2. Enter a name for your namespace, or keep the automatically generated one, then click **Create namespace and add container**.

3. Select your image from the registry:
    * Select the **Scaleway Container Registry**.
    * From the drop-down menu, select the **registry namespace** previously created.
    * Enter the **port** previously configured in the Dockerfile (`8080` by default)
    * From the drop-down menus, select the **container** and **tag** you created before using the dropdown lists.
    * **Name**: You can change the default name to use a more meaningful one.

4. Enter a name for your Serverless Container, or keep the automatically generated one.

5. Keep the default **resources** and **scaling** values. You can fine-tune them later without any downtime.

3. Click **Deploy container** to proceed. The initial deployment of your container can take up to a few minutes.

Your Serverless Container is deployed and ready. You can access it via its **endpoint**.
