## Log in to the console with a Magic Link

Instead of using your password, you can use a **Magic Link** to authenticate yourself when you log into the Scaleway console. This provides quick and secure access to your account without the hassle of remembering your password. When you choose to sign in with Magic Link, you receive a unique link sent directly to your email inbox which you can use one time only to authenticate your login. Afterward, it automatically becomes invalid.

1. Open your web browser and go to the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).
2. Enter your email address in the form and click **Send a Magic Link**.
   A magic link will be sent to your email inbox.
3. Check your email inbox for an email with the subject **Scaleway - Passwordless Authentication** and open it.
4. Click **Authenticate Myself** to connect to the Scaleway console.

You will be redirected to and logged into your management console.

A confirmation email is sent to your inbox, confirming that you have authenticated using the Magic Link.

<Message type="note">
  The Magic Link becomes invalid as soon as you have used it. If you log out from the console and want to log in again without your password, you will need to request a new magic link by repeating the steps above.
