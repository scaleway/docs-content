Serverless SQL Databases support the most popular [PostgreSQL extensions](#install-an-extension). Due to autoscaling and built-in connection pooling, some [advanced features of extensions might be limited or require workarounds](#supported-extensions).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created a Serverless SQL Database](/serverless/sql-databases/how-to/create-a-database/)

## Install an extension

1. [Connect to your Serverless SQL Database](/serverless/sql-databases/quickstart/#how-to-connect-to-a-database) with a PostgreSQL client (such as `psql`):
    ```bash
    psql "postgres://[user-or-application-id]:[api-secret-key]@[database-hostname]:5432/[database-name]?sslmode=require"
    ```

2. Run the following command to create an extension using SQL:
    ```sql
    CREATE EXTENSION extension_name;
    ```

3. Use the supported features of the extension.
    For instance, if you installed `pgvector` with `CREATE EXTENSION vector`, you can create a vector and query it:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE songs (id bigserial PRIMARY KEY, embedding vector(3));
    INSERT INTO songs (embedding) VALUES ('[1,1,1]'), ('[2,2,2]'), ('[0,1,2]');
    SELECT * FROM songs ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,3,3]' LIMIT 5;
    ```
    This example will find the nearest vectors (using L2 distance) from '[3,3,3]':
    ```sql
     id | embedding 
    ----+-----------
     2  | [2,2,2]
     1  | [1,1,1]
     3  | [0,1,2]
    ```

## Supported extensions

The following PostgreSQL extensions are available with Serverless SQL Databases:
