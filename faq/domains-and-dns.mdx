## What is the DNS feature?

Domain Name System (DNS) is a domain name management service that allows you to avoid browsing the Internet only by IP. It provides human management of addressable resources on the Internet. It is possible to create zones and records to manage a subdomain (e.g. `test.mydomain.com`) or specific configurations such as the MX of your mailbox.

## What are the prerequisites to register a Domain name?

To register a domain name you need:
- A valid email address to make sure your information is updated during the whole period of registration.
- A valid debit or credit card.

## Which rights are associated with the owner of a domain?

The owner of a domain can update all the technical and administrative parameters referring to their domain name. During the public beta, you must contact the support team if you want to modify the contacts you have entered.

## What are the responsibilities of the domain name holders?

The domain name holders must:

- comply with the terms and conditions posted by their Registrar, including applicable policies from their Registrar, the Registry, and ICANN.
- review their registrar's current registration agreement, along with any updates.
- assume sole responsibility for the registration and use of their domain name.

## What do I do if the domain name I want to register is not available?

## Is domain renewal automatic?

No. You must renew your domain name before the end of its validity period.
If you enable the [auto-renew feature](/network/domains-and-dns/how-to/configure-autorenew/), your domain name will be automatically renewed. 

<Message type="tip">
  You will be notified by email 60 days before your domain name expires. Your domain name will then switch to “late renew” status. 
</Message>

## Why has my current registrar opposed my request for change of domain name registrar?

The reasons for refusal are generally the following:
- The domain name is locked with the status ```client transfer prohibited```: the applicant forgot to remove the padlock from the registrar before requesting the transfer of the domain name.
- The domain name was registered for less than 60 days.
- The domain name was the subject of a previous transfer for less than 60 days.
- The domain name has expired.
- The domain name is the subject of a dispute in progress (UDRP procedure for example).
- The owner notified his/her refusal to transfer the domain name to another Registrar.
