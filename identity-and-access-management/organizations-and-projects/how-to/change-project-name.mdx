## How to change the name of your default Project

Each Scaleway Organization has at least one associated Project. Upon account creation, this Project is called **default**. The Project name can be changed after account and Organization creation.

It is possible to change the name of your default Project by following the procedure above.

When you change the default name, no changes occur in your configurations. For example, if you have an IAM policy configured with the previous Project name as a scope, it will not change if the Project name changes.

This happens because your configurations use the Project ID as an identifier, rather than the project name.

The default Project always takes on the Organization ID, and does not change when you change the Project name.

The default status cannot be transferred to other Projects.

<Message type="important">
  Make sure you denote exactly which of your Projects is the default one, as it will no longer take on this name to ensure the distinction.
