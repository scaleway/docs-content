You may experience loss of connectivity between resources in a VPC or Private Network, or problems accessing your private resources via SSH.

This page helps you solve potential errors that related to VPC access and reachability.

## I can't connect to a resource attached to a Private Network via SSH

### SSH bastion connection problems

You may be attempting to connect to a Scaleway Instance via [SSH bastion](/public-gateways/how-to/use-ssh-bastion/), and experience errors such as:

- `UNREACHABLE: Failed to connect to the host via ssh: Connection closed by remote host`
- `Connect failed: No address associated with hostname: Connection closed by UNKNOWN port 123`

### SSH bastion connection solutions

**Try using an IP address instead of a hostname**. An error such as `No address associated with hostname` suggests a problem with DNS resolution of the resource hostname. Try using the resource's private IP address in your connection command instead of its hostname.

**Check the validity of your Private Network and/or resource names**. Issues can be caused when:
    - Names contain dots. Replace dots with dashes (`my.instance` —> `my-instance`). We generally recommend avoiding using dots in your resource names to avoid issues.
    - Private Network names share the same name as a TLD. See our [dedicated troubleshooting docment](/vpc/troubleshooting/pn-name/#tld-naming-problem-with-private-networks).
    - A [legacy Public Gateway](/public-gateways/concepts/#legacy-gateway) is attached to a Private Network, and its DNS is [taking priority over that of the Private Network](/public-gateways/concepts/#legacy-gateway). Ensure you are using correct hostnames in accordance with your Public Gateway in this case.

**Ensure your SSH keys are up to date**. If you add new SSH keys to your Project credentials after activating SSH bastion, you will need to perform a reimport to update the bastion with the new keys. [Follow instructions in the dedicated documentation](/public-gateways/how-to/use-ssh-bastion/#how-to-reimport-ssh-keys).

**Ensure your Instance is not overloaded**. An error such as `Connection closed by UNKNOWN port 123` could be linked to excessive traffic on this port of your Instance, an overload of the Instance's resources (CPU, RAM etc.), or an excessive number of simultaneous connections.

Check the load on the Instance, and try again.

## SSH connection problems (non-bastion)

You may be attempting to connect to a Scaleway Instance that is attached to a Private Network, via SSH using its public IP address, and experiencing timeout errors.

### SSH connection solutions (non-bastion)

**Use SSH bastion**. If the Instance is attached to a Private Network on which there is also a Public Gateway advertising the default route, it is normal that you cannot connect using the public IP. Use SSH bastion instead: see our [dedicated troubleshooting page](/public-gateways/troubleshooting/cant-connect-to-instance-with-pn-gateway/)

## Resources cannot communicate in a VPC


- Check status

- MAC address issue 
loss of connectivity between resources in the same VPC. Reason: L’adresse MAC a été dupliqué entre votre proxmox de par1 et de par2. Basculer une même MAC d'une zone à l'autre n'est pas compatible avec le routage du VPC. Nous vous suggérons très fortement de ne plus basculer cette VM, car cela risque d’engendrer à nouveau les désagréments rencontrés. Nous vous recommandons de changer la MAC de votre VM, puis d'envoyer une gratuitous ARP dans le PN (avec arping par exemple), de manière à ce que les autres VMs soient à jour avec la nouvelle MAC.

- Different VPCs/Projects cannot communicate (no peering)

- DNS?
