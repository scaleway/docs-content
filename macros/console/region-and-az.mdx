A Region is as a geographical area such as France (Paris: `fr-par`) or the Netherlands (Amsterdam: `nl-ams`) in which Scaleway products and resources are located. It can contain multiple Availability Zones.

An Availability Zone refers to the geographical location within a region, such as `waw-1`(Warsaw, Poland), in which your Scaleway resource will be created. The latency between multiple AZs of the same region is low, as they have a common network layer.

For an extensive list of which regions and AZ a resource is available in, refer to our [Products availability guide](/console/account/reference-content/products-availability)
