## Problem

In some cases 502 errors can occur on Serverless Containers during autoscaling process: when the system creates new instances of the Container.

### Cause

When the new instance is created, Serverless healthcheck verification is by default done on the HTTP port. Once it's opened, the ressource is considered ready and traffic starts to be forwarded to it.

This is commonly due to the traffic being sent too early to the newly created Container.

### Possible solutions

To ensure the Serverless Container is completly ready, not only the HTTP port opened but also in the software scope the solution is to use **custom healthchecks**.

**Custom healthchecks** are available via the API, in this case it's recommended to implement a custom http route on the Container that returns the readiness status.

* [Link to API documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-containers/#path-containers-update-an-existing-container): look for `health_check`.

<Message type="tip">
  A simple health check to implement is just a simple `GET` on `/` to make sure the HTTP server is properly listening.

  Example (incomplete) settings:
  ```
  health_check: {
    http: {
        path: "/"
    }
    }
  ```

    Custom healthcheck feature will be available in the Scaleway console for Q1 2025.
