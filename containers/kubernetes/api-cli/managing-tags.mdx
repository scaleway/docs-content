<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/) a Scaleway Kubernetes cluster
</Message>

The Scaleway Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) will also synchronize the tags of Scaleway Instances to Kubernetes Labels on the nodes.

<Message type="note">
  When using Scaleway's managed Kubernetes, Kapsule, the tags on the pool will be transformed into tags on the pool's Instances, so applying to all Kubernetes nodes of the pool.
</Message>

## Labels

In order for a tag to be synced to a label, it needs to be of the form `foo=bar`.
In this case, the Kubernetes nodes will have the label `k8s.scaleway.com/foo=bar`.

Once the tag is removed from the instance, it will also be removed as a label on the node.

### Non prefixed labels

It is possible to add labels not prefixed with `k8s.scaleway.com`. The downside, is that when you delete the associated tag, the label will not get removed.
In order to have non prefixed labels, you should prefix the tag with `noprefix=`.

For instance the tag `noprefix=foo=bar` will yield the `foo=bar` label on the Kubernetes nodes.

This is the only way to add custom prefixed labels like `node.kubernetes.io`.

## Taints

In order for a tag to be synced to a taint, it needs to be of the form `taint=foo=bar:Effect`, where `Effect` is one of `NoExecute`, `NoSchedule` or `PreferNoSchedule`.
In this case, the Kubernetes nodes will have the taint `k8s.scaleway.com/foo=bar` with the effect `Effect`.

Once the tag is removed from the instance, it will also be removed as a taint on the node.

### Non prefixed Taints

It is possible to add taints not prefixed with `k8s.scaleway.com`. The downside, is that when you delete the associated tag, the taint will not get removed.
In order to have non prefixed taints, you should prefix the taint with `taint=noprefix=`.

For instance the tag `taint=noprefix=foo=bar:Effect` will yield the `foo=bar` taint on the Kubernetes nodes with the `Effect` effect.

This is the only way to add custom prefixed taints like `node.kubernetes.io`.

## Special Kubernetes labels

- `node.kubernetes.io/exclude-from-external-load-balancers` can be set on the Kubernetes nodes if this same value is set as a tag on the Instance. It will have the value `managed-by-scaleway-ccm` and will be deleted if deleted from the tags.
