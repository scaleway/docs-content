Scaleway LLM Inference service, a scalable and secure inference engine for machine learning models.

Scaleway LLM Inference is a fully managed service that allows you to run machine learning models in a production environment.
With Scaleway LLM Inference, you can easily deploy, manage, and scale your inference models without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

Here are some of the key features of Scaleway Inference:

* **Easy deployment**: Deploy your inference models with just a few clicks. Scaleway Inference provides a simple and intuitive interface for uploading and deploying models.
* **Auto-scaling**: Scaleway LLM Inference automatically scales your inference instances based on the demand, ensuring that your models are always available and responsive.
* **Security**: Scaleway provides a secure environment for running your inference models. Our platform is built on top of a secure architecture, and we use state-of-the-art security.

## How to create a LLM Inference deployment


1. Navigate to the **AI & Data** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/), and select **LLM Inference** from the side menu to access the LLM Inference dashboard.
2. Click on **Create deployment** to launch the deployment creation wizard.
3. Provide the necessary information:
    - Select the desired model and the quantization to use for your deployment from the available options:
        - Llama-2-70b
        - Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1
        - WizardLM-70b-V1.0
        <Message type="note">
          Some models may require acceptance of an end-user license agreement. If prompted, review the terms and conditions and accept the license accordingly.

    - Choose the geographical **region** for the deployment.
    - Specify the GPU Instance type to be used with your deployment.
4. Enter a **name** for the deployment, along with an optional description and tags to aid in organization.
5. Configure the **network** settings for the deployment:
    - Enable **Private Network** for secure communication and restricted availability within Private Networks. Choose an existing Private Network from the drop-down list, if applicable.
    - Enable **Public Network** to access resources via the public IP address of the GPU Instance.
    <Message type="important">
      - Once configured, network settings cannot be modified after deployment creation. 
      - Enabling both private and public networks will result in two distinct endpoints (public and private) for your deployment.
