## Which dedicated server should I choose?
We offer five ranges of Dedibox servers: **Start**, **Pro**, **Core**, **Store**, and **GPU**. Check the [Dedibox website](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/) to find detailed information on their specifications and discover the one that best fits your needs.

## How long does it take to deliver my dedicated server?
The delivery of Dedibox dedicated servers is ultra-fast: 2 minutes on average. Next, choose your operating system in our library or install your ISO image directly. Any configuration displayed on our website is available in stock for instant delivery.

## Where are the Dedibox dedicated servers hosted?
All Dedibox servers and associated services are hosted in our Paris & Amsterdam data centers. We also have a Warsaw data center.

## Is my data secure?
Scaleway does not have access to your data; however, you are responsible for your backups and the redundancy systems to be put in place to ensure continuity of service even in the event of hardware failure.

## I need help, who can I talk to?
When choosing your servers for your use case, you can contact our solution advisors [here](https://www.scaleway.com/en/contact/). For technical assistance on the configuration and use of your servers, our experts are at your disposal.

## What is your policy regarding IP addresses?
Public IPv4 addresses have become a rare and expensive resource. Each dedicated server is provided with a public IPv4 address at no extra cost. Additional addresses are available for an additional charge with the “IP Failover” option.

## How is the price of my server calculated?
Our prices are updated daily based on demand, available stocks, and component and energy market prices. Some components, such as RAM memory and SSD disks, have high volatility. Do not worry, the price at the time of order is guaranteed for the first 12 months of your subscription.

## How long is my server contract?
Your server operates on a monthly contract, with the billing cycle running from the first to the last day of each month. When placing an order, you will be billed pro rata for the current month, unless you pay via SEPA direct debit. In that case, your first invoice will be issued during your first complete month and include both the pro rata amount for the current month and the full amount for the following month.

## What are Dedibox commitment plans?
A commitment plan allows you to commit to keeping your Dedibox for a period of 12 or 36 months. By choosing a commitment period, you benefit from lower monthly rent for your server and free setup, depending on the plan you choose.

## Can I benefit from a commitment plan on a server I'm already renting?
No, commitment plans are available only for new subscriptions.

## Will my server options also benefit from the discount?
No, the discount applies only to the Dedibox server.

## Is there an automatic renewal of the commitment?
Yes, by default, your commitment is renewed automatically at the end of the commitment period. You can disable the automatic renewal in your server's options.

## At the end of the commitment, what will the price for my Dedibox be?
At the end of the commitment, you will pay the standard price at the time of the subscription. Your commitment discount will no longer apply.

## Can I terminate a Dedibox during the commitment period?
You can request termination at any time, but it will only be effective after the end of the commitment period. You will retain access to your server until the commitment period ends.

## Can I change the commitment period?
No, the commitment period cannot be changed after the subscription.

## Are there commitment plans for Elastic Metal or Dedibox VPS?
No, commitment plans are only available for eligible Dedibox dedicated servers.

## How much does a Windows Server license cost?

Windows Server 2019 and 2022 licenses are billed monthly (no prorating) based on the following factors:
- Number of physical CPUs
- Number of cores per CPU
- Operating System version: Standard or Datacenter

**Important:**
Starting **February 1, 2025**, the price of Windows licenses for new and existing Dedibox customers will increase due to a price adjustment from Microsoft.

Below is a comparison of the current and updated pricing for Windows licenses on Dedibox servers:
