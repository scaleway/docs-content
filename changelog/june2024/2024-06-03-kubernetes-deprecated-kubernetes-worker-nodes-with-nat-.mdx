Starting this deprecation cycle, existing Kubernetes Kapsule or Kosmos worker nodes can move from NAT IPs to Routed IPs. 

With Routed IPs, your worker nodes will receive a flexible IP address, maintaining IP consistency even if the Instance is restarted or the hypervisor is changed.

NAT IPs will be at End of Life on October 1st, 2024.
