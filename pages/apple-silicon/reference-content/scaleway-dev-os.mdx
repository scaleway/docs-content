Dev OS is a developer-optimized operating system based on a recent version of macOS. It comes pre-configured with a complete set of development tools, runtimes, and dependencies aligned with the software stack used in GitHub Actions runner images.

## Pre-installed software & developer tooling

Dev OS comes pre-installed with a complete set of development tools and packages, including Apache, Xcode, web browsers, multiple programming language runtimes, SDKs, and more.  
Choosing Dev OS eliminates the need for time-consuming manual installations. All installed components closely follow the configuration of the [GitHub Actions macOS-15 runner image](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/macos/macos-15-Readme.md), ensuring consistency between environments.

<Message type="important">
  Although all software is pre-installed, **users are responsible for configuring tools according to their specific needs** (e.g., setting default Python versions, initializing Homebrew, configuring Git credentials, enabling Apache modules) and for **keeping this software up to date**.
</Message>

This ready-to-use toolkit typically saves developers **6–10+ hours** of initial setup time and helps prevent configuration drift across teams.

## Disk space requirements

Because Dev OS includes a large number of tools, runtimes, and dependencies, the system has a **base footprint of approximately 270 GB**.

<Message type="note">
  Keep in mind:
  - Available user storage is significantly reduced compared to standard macOS installations.
  - Dev OS is not compatible with Mac minis offering less than **512 GB** of storage.

## Software licensing & user agreement

By requesting and using a Dev OS machine, users acknowledge and agree to the **license terms of all pre-installed software**.

This includes, but is not limited to:

* Apple’s Xcode and macOS software licenses
* Open-source licenses (MIT, GPL, Apache, etc.) for tools such as Homebrew, Node.js, and Python
* Third-party SDKs and binaries distributed via their official sources

Each of these software packages is subject to its own license terms, which must be reviewed and accepted by the customer. The corresponding license information is available in the SBOM file included with the assets, accessible [here](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/releases/tag/macos-15-arm64%2F20251210.0068).

Users **must comply** with all applicable licensing terms. Scaleway is not responsible for any misuse of, or non-compliance with, third-party software licenses.
