When deploying large Helm releases on Scaleway Kapsule Kubernetes, you might encounter errors like the following:

```bash
rpc error: code = ResourceExhausted desc = etcd quota exceeded: size 55000000/55000000, burst 424242/100000000
```

This happens because Helm stores release information in Kubernetes **Secrets** or **ConfigMaps**, which are limited to 1 MB due to **etcd** storage constraints.

To resolve this issue, you can configure Helm to use an SQL storage backend such as **PostgreSQL**, bypassing the etcd size limitations and enabling larger Helm releases.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Created a [Kubernetes Kapsule cluster](/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/)

## Setting up a PostgreSQL database

You can set up a PostgreSQL database using one of the two options below.

### Option A: Scaleway's managed PostgreSQL Service
1. [Create a PostgreSQL instance](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/create-a-database/) using Scaleway's Managed Database service to create a PostgreSQL database.
2. [Whitelist your cluster's IPs](/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/manage-allowed-ip-addresses/) to allow your Kubernetes cluster to connect to the database.
3. Note down the connection details. Save the host, port, database name, username, and password for later use.

### Option B: Deploy PostgreSQL in Kubernetes
1. Deploy PostgreSQL using Helm in your cluster:
   ```bash
   helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
   helm install helm-postgres bitnami/postgresql \
       --set auth.username=helm,auth.password=yourpassword,auth.database=helm_db
   ```
2. [Expose](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/expose/expose-intro/) the PostgreSQL service within the cluster.

<Message type="important">
    **Update security group rules**<br />
    When you create a Scaleway Kapsule cluster, a new security group blocks incoming traffic by default. To allow external traffic (if needed):

    1. Navigate to **Compute > Security Groups** in the Scaleway console.
    2. Locate the security group associated with your cluster (e.g., `kubernetes-<cluster-id>`).
    3. Modify rules to allow:
    - TCP traffic on port `80` for HTTP (from `0.0.0.0/0`).
    - TCP traffic on port `443` for HTTPS (from `0.0.0.0/0`).

## Configuring Helm to use the SQL backend

To use PostgreSQL as Helm's storage backend, set the following environment variables in your terminal:
```bash
export HELM_DRIVER=sql
export HELM_DRIVER_SQL_CONNECTION_STRING="postgresql://username:password@host:port/database"
```
<Message type="note">
    Replace `username`, `password`, `host`, `port`, and `database` with your PostgreSQL details.
</Message>

Once set, Helm will store release metadata in the specified PostgreSQL database instead of Kubernetes Secrets or ConfigMaps.

## Verifying the configuration

To confirm Helm is configured correctly, run:
```bash
helm list --all-namespaces
```

Expected output:

- A list of Helm releases managed by the PostgreSQL backend.
- If there are no releases, ensure the connection string is correct and PostgreSQL is reachable.

If configured correctly, Helm will use the SQL backend, and you will not encounter etcd size limitations.

## Migrating existing releases (if applicable)

Helm does not automatically migrate releases between storage backends. Follow these steps to manually migrate existing releases:

### Backup existing releases

- Run the following command to back up your existing releases:
    ```bash
    kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -l "owner=helm" -o yaml > helm-backup.yaml
    ```

### Reinstall releases

- Redeploy the releases using the SQL backend:
    ```bash
    helm upgrade --install <release-name> <chart-name> --namespace <namespace>
    ```
    <Message type="note">
    Ensure you use the same release names and namespaces.
    </Message>

### Verify releases

- Run the following command to verify your releases:
    ```bash
    helm list --all-namespaces
    ```

### Clean up old secrets (after confirming everything works)

- Use the following command to delete your backup (after confirming everything works):
    ```bash
    kubectl delete -f helm-backup.yaml
    ```

## Troubleshooting common issues and solutions

| Issue                               | Solution                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Connection timeout or authentication failures | Verify network connectivity, firewall rules, and database credentials. |
| Errors persist after switching to SQL backend | Check `HELM_DRIVER` and `HELM_DRIVER_SQL_CONNECTION_STRING` variables. |
| Missing previous releases           | Releases in Secrets/`ConfigMaps` are not auto-migrated. Redeploy them.    |
