import Requirements from '@macros/iam/requirements.mdx'


<Requirements />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Installed [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) or [Docker Egine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Created a Scaleway Container Registry namespace](/container-registry/how-to/create-namespace/) and [logged into it](/container-registry/how-to/connect-docker-cli/)


## Create and host a simple HTML static page

To host a static HTML page on Serverless Containers, you first need to create a simple HTML page that will serve as your website. Next, you will write a Dockerfile to containerize your application, specifying how your HTML file should be served. You will then build the container image locally, and push it to the [Scaleway Container Registry](/container-registry/), before deploying it to [Scaleway Serverless Containers](/serverless-containers/).

1. In a terminal, run the command below to create a new folder and access it:

  ```sh
  mkdir my-static-website
  cd my-static-website
  ```

2. Create a new `index.html` file and add the example code below to it:

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
  <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <title>Simple HTML Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>This is a simple paragraph.</p>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```

3. In the same folder, create a new `dockerfile` file and add the following code to it:

  ```dockerfile
  FROM nginx:alpine
  COPY ./my-website /usr/share/nginx/html
  EXPOSE 80
  ```

4. Run the command below to build, tag, and push your image to the Scaleway Container registry:

  ```sh
  docker build --platform linux/amd64 \
  --push \
  -t <CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT>/my-static-website:latest .
  ```

  <Message type="note">
  You can find your Container Registry endpoint in the **Settings** tab of your Container Registry Endpoint in the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/registry/namespaces)
  </Message>

5. [Deploy a Serverless Container](/serverless-containers/how-to/deploy-container/) with the following parameters:

  - **Registry**: Scaleway Container Registry
  - **Registry namespace**: the Container Registry namespace you pushed your image to.
  - **Container port**: `8O` as it is the [port](/serverless-containers/reference-content/port-parameter-variable/) exposed in the dockerfile.
  - **Resources**: `100 mVCPU` and `256 MB` memory
  - **Autoscaling**: according to your needs. Refer to the [autoscaling documentation](/serverless-containers/reference-content/containers-autoscaling/) for more information.

  The deployment of your container can take up to a minute to complete.

6. Once your container is **ready**, click the **container endpoint** from its **Overview** tab. Your web page displays, and is available to anyone with the link.
