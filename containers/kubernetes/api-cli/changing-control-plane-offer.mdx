Different Kubernetes [cluster types](/faq/kubernetes/#can-i-choose-the-type-of-control-plane-for-my-cluster) are available.

You can use the CLI to specify your cluster type of choice when [creating a new cluster](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/blob/master/docs/commands/k8s.md#create-a-new-cluster), as well as changing the cluster type once the cluster has already been created.

In this tutorial, we show you how to change your cluster type using the Scaleway CLI (v2).

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
  - You have generated your [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
  - You have downloaded and installed the most recent version of the [Scaleway CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli#scaleway-cli-v2)
  - You have [created a cluster](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster)

1. Run the following command to list the viable cluster types.
    ```
    scw k8s cluster-type list
    ```

    The output provides the details of each type, such as available stock, features and commitment:

    ```
    $ scw k8s cluster-type list
    NAME                     AVAILABILITY  MAX NODES  COMMITMENT DELAY  SLA
    kapsule                  available     150        0 seconds         0
    kapsule-dedicated-4      available     250        30 days           99.5
    kapsule-dedicated-8      available     500        30 days           99.5
    kapsule-dedicated-16     available     500        30 days           99.5
    multicloud               available     150        0 seconds         0
    multicloud-dedicated-4   available     250        30 days           99.5
    multicloud-dedicated-8   available     500        30 days           99.5
    multicloud-dedicated-16  available     500        30 days           99.5
    ```
2. Run the following command to know which of the clusters are available and compatible with your current type. The availability is defined by the current type, commitment and overall stock.

    Replace `<cluster-id>` with the ID of your current cluster.

    ```
    scw k8s cluster list-available-types <cluster-id>
    ```

    An output like the following displays:

    ```
    ClusterTypes.0.Name             kapsule
    ClusterTypes.0.Availability     available
    ClusterTypes.0.MaxNodes         150
    ClusterTypes.0.CommitmentDelay  0 seconds
    ClusterTypes.0.SLA              0
    ClusterTypes.0.Resiliency       standard
    ClusterTypes.0.Memory           4.0 GB
    ClusterTypes.0.Dedicated        false
    ClusterTypes.1.Name             kapsule-dedicated-4
    ClusterTypes.1.Availability     available
    ClusterTypes.1.MaxNodes         250
    ClusterTypes.1.CommitmentDelay  30 days
    ClusterTypes.1.SLA              99.5
    ClusterTypes.1.Resiliency       high_availability
    ClusterTypes.1.Memory           4.0 GB
    ClusterTypes.1.Dedicated        true
    ClusterTypes.2.Name             kapsule-dedicated-8
    ClusterTypes.2.Availability     available
    ClusterTypes.2.MaxNodes         500
    ClusterTypes.2.CommitmentDelay  30 days
    ClusterTypes.2.SLA              99.5
    ClusterTypes.2.Resiliency       high_availability
    ClusterTypes.2.Memory           8.0 GB
    ClusterTypes.2.Dedicated        true
    ClusterTypes.3.Name             kapsule-dedicated-16
    ClusterTypes.3.Availability     available
    ClusterTypes.3.MaxNodes         500
    ClusterTypes.3.CommitmentDelay  30 days
    ClusterTypes.3.SLA              99.5
    ClusterTypes.3.Resiliency       high_availability
    ClusterTypes.3.Memory           16 GB
    ClusterTypes.3.Dedicated        true
    TotalCount                      4
    ```
3. Retrieve the details of your cluster to determine the commitment period.
    ```
    scw k8s cluster get <cluster-id>
    ```

    <Message type="important">
    Dedicated control plane environments come with a commitment to keep the environment for at least 30 calendar days. Keep in mind that:
      - Upgrading to a higher tier cluster type restarts the 30 days of commitment
      - Downgrading a cluster’s control plane is not possible during an active commitment period
      - No commitment extensions are applied for downgrades after the commitment period. Once the commitment period is completed, migrating to a lower tier is possible from the console.

    ```
4. Change the cluster type.
    ```
    scw k8s cluster set-type <cluster-id> type=<cluster-type> region=<region-of-cluster>
    ```

    Replace `<cluster-id>`, `<cluster-type>` and `<region-of-cluster>` with their respective values.

    <Message type="important">
    The region of your cluster cannot be changed.

    If your cluster is located in a region other than `fr-par`, you must specify which one in the command. Otherwise, an error will be returned.
    </Message>

    If the operation is successful, your cluster starts updating to the new cluster type.
