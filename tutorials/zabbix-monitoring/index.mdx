Zabbix is a powerful open-source software that offers real-time monitoring for servers, virtual machines, network devices, and web applications. Monitoring metrics such as network utilization, CPU load, and disk space consumption are collected by Zabbix and then stored in a database.

This monitoring tool enables users to determine the health status of their IT infrastructure and analyze data over time. The insights provided by Zabbix can be used to plan upgrades to the infrastructure when requirements grow.

In this tutorial, we will use two Scaleway [Production-Optimized](/compute/instances/reference-content/choosing-instance-type/) Ubuntu Jammy Jellyfish (22.04 LTS) Instances. One Instance will be a server hosting the Zabbix application, while the other will be a client being monitored. Following this tutorial will teach you how to set up Zabbix and take control of your IT infrastructure.

<Message type="tip">
  We recommend you follow this tutorial using a [Production-Optimized Instance](/compute/instances/reference-content/choosing-instance-type/).

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />
 
<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your SSH key](/console/project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
  - You have sudo privileges or access to the root user.
  - You have two [Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/) running Ubuntu Jammy Jellyfish (22.O4 LTS)
  - The Instance acting as server should have a [LEMP-Stack](/tutorials/installation-lemp-ubuntu-bionic/) installed
</Message>

## Installing the Zabbix server

<Message type="important">
  Make sure that a [LEMP-Stack](/tutorials/installation-lemp-ubuntu-bionic/) is installed on the Instance before continuing.
</Message>

1. Download the repository configuration package. Refer to the [Zabbix website](https://www.zabbix.com/download) for the latest version of the repository.
    ```
    wget https://repo.zabbix.com/zabbix/6.4/ubuntu/pool/main/z/zabbix-release/zabbix-release_6.4-1+ubuntu22.04_all.deb
    ```
    <Message type="tip">
      The version of Zabbix available across Ubuntu repositories is outdated. We strongly recommended you download the latest version directly from the Zabbix repositories.
    </Message>
2. Install the repository configuration with the help of `dpkg`.
    ```
    dpkg -i zabbix-release*
    ```
3. Update the APT package cache to use the newly installed repository.
    ```
    apt update
    ```
4. Install the Zabbix server, the web frontend and `zabbix-agent` which collects information about the Instance itself.
    ```
    apt -y install mariadb-server zabbix-server-mysql zabbix-frontend-php zabbix-nginx-conf zabbix-sql-scripts zabbix-agent
    ```

## Setting up the MariaDB database

Data of the Zabbix server is stored in a rational database and the application comes with support for [MariaDB (MySQL)](/tutorials/mariadb-ubuntu-bionic/) and [PostgreSQL](/tutorials/install-postgresql). It is also possible to store data in nosql databases, like [Elasticsearch](/tutorials/collecting-visualizing-logs-elastic-stack/).

This tutorial uses a **MariaDB** database with Zabbix.

<Message type="important">
  Make sure to [initalize](/tutorials/mariadb-ubuntu-bionic/#securing-mariadb) your MariaDB server before configuring the database.
</Message>

1. Log into MariaDB with the user **root** and the password set during the installation.
    ```
    mysql -uroot -p
    ```
2. Create the Zabbix database and set the charset to UTF-8.
    ```
    create database zabbix character set utf8mb4 collate utf8mb4_bin;
    ```
3. Create a user for the Zabbix server and set their password to `secure_zabbix_mariadb_password`. Then, grant the user access to the previously created database, so they can use it.
    ```
    create user zabbix@localhost identified by 'secure_zabbix_mariadb_password';
    grant all privileges on zabbix.* to zabbix@localhost;
    ```
4. Flush the privileges to apply the new configuration.
    ```
    flush privileges;
    ```
5. Exit the MariaDB console.
    ```
    quit;
    ```
6. Set up the database schema and import the data into the database that was previously created. Since the file is compressed, use `zcat`. When prompted, enter the password for the MariaDB user that was previously created. If the data is imported successfully, there will be no output.
    ```
    zcat /usr/share/zabbix-sql-scripts/mysql/server.sql.gz | mysql --default-character-set=utf8mb4 -uzabbix -p zabbix
    ```
7. Disable the `log_bin_trust_function_creators` option after importing the schema into your database.
    ```
    mysql -uroot -p
    password
    mysql> set global log_bin_trust_function_creators = 0;
    mysql> quit;
    ```
7. Set the password in the Zabbix configuration file by opening it in a text editor (i.e. `nano`).
    ```
    nano /etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf
    ```

    Scroll down to this section.

    ```
    ### Option: DBPassword
    #       Database password.
    #       Comment this line if no password is used.
    #
    # Mandatory: no
    # Default:
    # DBPassword=
    ```

    Uncomment the line `# DBPassword` by removing the leading hash and set the password (`DBPassword=secure_zabbix_mariadb_password`) for the Zabbix MariaDB user. Then safe the file and quit the text editor.

## Configuring Nginx

1. Create an Nginx configuration file for the Zabbix web interface and open it in a text editor. Make sure to replace `zabbix.example.com` with the hostname of your Instance.
    ```
    nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/zabbix.example.com
    ```
2. Copy the following content into the configuration file.
    ```json
    server {
            listen          8080;
            server_name     zabbix.example.com;

            root    /usr/share/zabbix;

            index   index.php;

            }

            location /vendor {
                    deny            all;
                    return          404;
            }

    <Message type="important">
      For security reasons, we recommend that you use an encrypted connection to the Zabbix web interface. A free certificate can be obtained from [Let's Encrypt](/tutorials/installation-lemp-ubuntu-bionic/#configuring-ssl-with-let's-encrypt).
    </Message>
3. Create a symlink to activate the new server block
    ```
    ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/zabbix.example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
    ```
4. Check the spelling syntax of the Nginx configuration.
    ```
    nginx -t
    ```
5. If no errors were detected, restart Nginx to activate the new configuration.
    ```
    systemctl restart nginx.service
    ```
6. Start the Zabbix service and enable it to be started automatically during the system startup.
    ```
    systemctl restart zabbix-server zabbix-agent nginx php8.1-fpm && systemctl enable zabbix-server zabbix-agent nginx php8.1-fpm

## Configuring Zabbix agent

<Message type="important">
  The following steps must be carried out on the second Instance which will be monitored by Zabbix.
</Message>

1. Log into the second Instance via SSH.
2. Download and install the repository configuration. As on the server, the Zabbix repository needs to be added to apt, to be able to use the latest release of the tool.
    ```
    wget https://repo.zabbix.com/zabbix/6.2/ubuntu/pool/main/z/zabbix-release/zabbix-release_6.2-4%2Bubuntu22.04_all.deb
    dpkg -i zabbix-release*
    ```
3. Update the APT package index.
    ```
    apt update
    ```
4. Install `zabbix-agent`.
    ```
    apt install zabbix-agent
    ```
5. Generate a [pre-shared key (PSK)](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/6.2/manual/encryption/using_pre_shared_keys) to secure the connection between server and agent.
    ```
    sh -c "openssl rand -hex 32 > /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.psk" && cat /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.psk
    ```

    <Message type="important">
      Zabbix also supports [TLS certificates](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/6.2/manual/encryption/using_certificates) for authentication. In this tutorial PSKs are used as a basic authentication method.
    </Message>

    An output as the following displays. Take a note of it, as it will be required later.

    ```
    01134cd49a5a27cc07d8469ebe9610841ce4062337d7cbaa337a4290682b6acc
    ```
6. Open the Zabbix Agent configuration file in a text editor (i.e. `nano`).
    ```
    nano /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.conf
    ```
7. Scroll down until the following block displays on screen.
    ```
    ### Option: Server
    #       List of comma delimited IP addresses, optionally in CIDR notation, or DNS names of Zabbix servers and $
    #       Incoming connections will be accepted only from the hosts listed here.
    #       If IPv6 support is enabled then '127.0.0.1', '::127.0.0.1', '::ffff:127.0.0.1' are treated equally
    #       and '::/0' will allow any IPv4 or IPv6 address.
    #       '0.0.0.0/0' can be used to allow any IPv4 address.
    #       Example: Server=127.0.0.1,192.168.1.0/24,::1,2001.db8::/32,zabbix.example.com
    #
    # Mandatory: yes, if StartAgents is not explicitly set to 0
    # Default:
    # Server=

    Server=127.0.0.1
    ```

    Replace `127.0.0.1` with the IP of the Zabbix server instance.
8. Scroll down further in the configuration file until the `TLSConnect` block displays on screen.
    ```
    ### Option: TLSConnect
    #       How the agent should connect to server or proxy. Used for active checks.
    #       Only one value can be specified.
    #               unencrypted - connect without encryption
    #               psk         - connect using TLS and a pre-shared key
    #               cert        - connect using TLS and a certificate
    #
    # Mandatory: yes, if TLS certificate or PSK parameters are defined (even for 'unencrypted' connection)
    # Default:
    # TLSConnect=unencrypted
    ```

    Uncomment the line `# TLSConnect=unencrypted` and modify it as follows. `TLSConnect=psk`.
9. Scroll down to the `TLSAccept` block which manages incoming connections.
    ```
    ### Option: TLSAccept
    #       What incoming connections to accept.
    #       Multiple values can be specified, separated by commas.
    #               unencrypted - accept connections without encryption
    #               psk         - accept connections secured with TLS and a pre-shared key
    #               cert        - accept connections secured with TLS and a certificate
    #
    # Mandatory: yes, if TLS certificate or PSK parameters are defined (even for 'unencrypted' connection)
    # Default:
    # TLSAccept=unencrypted
    ```

    Uncomment the line `# TLSAccept=unencrypted` and modify it as follows: `TLSAccept=psk`.
10. Scroll down to the `TLSPSKIdentity` block in the configuration file.
    ```
    ### Option: TLSPSKIdentity
    #       Unique, case sensitive string used to identify the pre-shared key.
    #
    # Mandatory: no
    # Default:
    # TLSPSKIdentity=
    ```

    Uncomment the last line of the block and set a unique name to identify the PSK used:`TLSPSKIdentity=ZabbixPSK-01`. This value is used as **PSK ID** when adding the host through the Zabbix web interface.
11. Scroll down to the `TLSPSKFile` block in the configuration file to provide the file path to the key generated in a previous step.
    ```
    ### Option: TLSPSKFile
    #       Full pathname of a file containing the pre-shared key.
    #
    # Mandatory: no
    # Default:
    # TLSPSKFile=
    ```

    Uncomment the last line of block and set the path to the PSK file: `TLSPSKFile=/etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.psk`. Then save the file and exit the editor.
12. Restart the `zabbix-agent` service and enable it to start automatically during the system boot.
    ```
    systemctl restart zabbix-agent.service
    systemctl enable zabbix-agent.service
    ```
13. If `ufw` is installed and active on the Instance, allow traffic on port 10050.
    ```
    ufw allow 10050/tcp
    ```

## Adding a host to Zabbix

1. Open a web browser and navigate to your Zabbix server Instance (i.e. `http://zabbix.example.com/`). Enter the Username **Admin** and Password **zabbix**, then click **Sign in**. You are logged in and the Zabbix dashboard displays.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-zabbix-dashboard.webp" alt="" />
2. Click **Configuration**, then **Hosts**. On the hosts page, click **Create Host** to add the second Instance.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-zabbix-create-host.webp" alt="" />
3. Enter the **Host name** of the second Instance and its **IP address**. Optionally one or several groups can be chosen to bundle Instances in groups.
4. Click **Templates** to choose a configuration template for the instance. Select `Templates/Operating systems` -> `Linux by Zabbix agent` and click **Select**.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-zabbix-add-server-01.webp" alt="" />
5. Click the **Encryption** tab and set PSK for both **Connections to host** and **Connections from host**. Set **PSK identity** to the value of the `TLSPSKIdentity` configured in the Zabbix Agent configuration (i.e. **ZabbixPSK-01**) and set the PSK value to the key generated during the configuration of the Agent. Once set, click **Add** at the bottom of the page to add the Instance to Zabbix.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-zabbix-add-server-02.webp" alt="" />
6. Once added, wait for about one minute before reloading the server list. The new Instance appears and the labels **ZBX** and **PSK** indicate that the Zabbix agent is running on the Instance and that the connection is encrypted with a pre-shared key.

## Adding users
