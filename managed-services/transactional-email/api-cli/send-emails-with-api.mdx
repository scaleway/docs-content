This page shows you how to send a simple transactional email in `JSON` format to multiple recipients using the `additional_headers` parameter and the Scaleway Transactional Email API.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Configured your API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Installed curl](https://curl.se/download.html)
- [Configured](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/configure-domain-with-transactional-email/) your domain name with Transactional Email
- [Added SPF, DKIM](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/add-spf-dkim-records-to-your-domain/), [MX](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/add-mx-record-to-your-domain/) and [DMARC](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/add-mx-record-to-your-domain/) records to your domain


1. Open a terminal and paste the following code to configure your environment variables. Make sure that you add your own values.

        ```
        export SCW_ACCESS_KEY="<API access key>"
        export SCW_SECRET_KEY="<API secret key>"
        export SCW_PROJECT_ID="<Scaleway Project ID>"
        ```

2. Run the following command to retrieve your domain's ID, as you will need it in the next step. The output should return your domain's information.

        ```
        curl -X GET \
        -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
        "https://api.scaleway.com/transactional-email/v1alpha1/regions/fr-par/domains"
        ```


3. Run the following command to ensure that your domain is verified:

        ```
        curl -X GET "https://api.scaleway.com/transactional-email/v1alpha1/regions/$REGION/domains/<domain-id>" \
        -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY"
        ```

4. Copy the following template. Make sure that you replace the placeholder information with your own.

        ```
        cat > mail.json <<EOF
        {
            "from": {
                "name": "Me", # Replace 'Me' with your own name
                "email": "me@my.domain.example.com"  # Replace 'me@my.domain.example.com' with your email address
            },
            "to": [
                {
                    "name": "Your recipient", # Replace 'Your recipient' with your recipient's name
                    "email": "your.recipient@mail.fr" # Replace 'your.recipient@mail.fr' with your recipient's email address
                }
            ],
            "subject": "This is a subject", # Replace with your subject. Subjects must have at least 10 characters
            "project_id": "<Scaleway Project ID>", # Replace '<Scaleway Project ID>' with your Scaleway Project ID
            "text": "This is a short sentence.", # Replace with the body of your email
            "html": "<html><body><p>This is a short sentence.</p></body></html>", # Replace with the content you want to send,
            "attachments": [
		{
			"name": "test.pdf",
			"type": "application/pdf",
			"content": "AAAA==" # Your PDF encoded in Base64
		}
            ],
            "additional_headers": [
                {
                    "key": "Reply-To",
                    "value": "user1@example.com, user2@example.com, user3@example.com" # Replace the email addresses with the relevant ones
                }
            ]
        }
        EOF

        curl -X POST "https://api.scaleway.com/transactional-email/v1alpha1/regions/$REGION/emails" \
            -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
            -d @mail.json
        ```

5. Once you have added your own information to the template above, run it in your terminal. An output similar to the following should display:

        ```
        {"emails":[{"id":"655c27f2-b2a3-4a9f-8e1f-3e6dc268b1c4","message_id":"3d928e21-187a-4539-b303-403156e37911","project_id":"8j512135-9f5f-42b3-a900-9fdf0195b563","mail_from":"me@my.domain.example.com","rcpt_to":"your.recipient@mail.fr","rcpt_type":"to","created_at":"2024-04-01T07:55:36.758671147Z","updated_at":"2024-04-01T07:55:36.758671147Z","status":"new","status_details":"not yet processed","try_count":0,"last_tries":[]}]}
        ```

6. Run the following command to check that your email has been sent. Make sure that you replace `$EMAIL_ID` with the ID of the email you retrieved in the output of the previous step.

        ```
        curl --request GET \
        --url https://api.scaleway.com/transactional-email/v1alpha1/regions/fr-par/emails/$EMAIL_ID \
        --header 'X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY'

        ```

    You should get an output similar to the following:

            ```
            {
                "id": "655c27f2-b2a3-4a9f-8e1f-3e6dc268b1c4",
                "message_id": "3d928e21-187a-4539-b303-403156e37911",
                "project_id": "8j512135-9f5f-42b3-a900-9fdf0195b563",
                "mail_from": "me@my.domain.example.com",
                "rcpt_to": "your.recipient@mail.fr",
                "rcpt_type": "to",
                "created_at": "2024-04-01T07:55:36.758671Z",
                "updated_at": "2024-04-01T07:55:41.266916Z",
                "status": "sent",
                "status_details": "success",
                "try_count": 1,
                "last_tries": [
                    {
                        "rank": 1,
                        "tried_at": "2024-04-01T07:55:41.266916Z",
                        "code": 250,
                        "message": "Ok"
                    }
                ]
            }
            ```
