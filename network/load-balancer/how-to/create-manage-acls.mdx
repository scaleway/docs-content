## How to create ACLs

ACLs are created and managed at the frontend(s) of your Load Balancer.

1. Click **Load Balancers** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu.

2. Click the Load Balancer you want to create ACLs for.

3. Click the **Frontends** tab.

4. Click the name of the frontend you want to create ACLs for.

    The **Overview** tab for the frontend displays. 

5. Click the **ACLs** tab.

6. Click **Create ACL** or the <Icon name ="plus" /> button. The ACL creation wizard displays.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-acl.webp" alt="" />

    The first part of the wizard asks you to set a name and optional description for the ACL.

7. Enter the following information:
    - **ACL name**: a name for your ACL.
    - **Priority**: a priority number for your ACL. ACLs are applied in order of priority, starting from the lowest numbered rule.
    - **Description**: an optional description for your ACL.

    The second part of the wizard asks you to define the action for the ACL, and the conditions under which the action should be applied.

8. Select an **action** from the following options:
    - **Allow**: Allow traffic to pass to the Load Balancer's backend.
    - **Deny**: Deny traffic from passing to the Load Balancer's backend.
    - **Redirect**: Redirect traffic to an alternative URI.
      - Select a [redirection code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#3xx_redirection). The default value is `302`. Other options are `301`, `303`, `307` or `308`.
      - Select a redirection URI option, from:
        - **Keep original**: Redirect to the original URI.
          - Select a **scheme** (HTTP or HTTPS) and **port** for the redirect.
        - **Define custom**: Define a custom URI to direct to, in the format `https://{{host}}/{{path}}?{{query}}`. Note that the only valid placeholder values are `{{host}}`, `{{path}}` and `{{query}}`, and there must be no spaces between the curly braces and the string. You may use any, all or none of these placeholder values in your redirect URI.
        <Message type="tip">
          For more information about using ACLs to set up redirections, see our [reference documentation](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/acls/#using-acls-to-redirect-traffic)

9. Use the **Enable condition** toggle to choose whether to set a condition for the action.
    - If you do not enable a condition, the action will be applied uniformly to all traffic arriving at the Load Balancer's frontend.
    - If you enable a condition, the action will be applied only to traffic meeting the condition you set below.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-acl-condition.webp" alt="" />

10. Set the condition type for your action, if you enabled a condition in the previous step. Choose from:
    - **IF MATCH**: The action will be applied to all traffic that matches the filters (defined in the next step).
    - **IF NO MATCH**: The action will be applied to all traffic that does **not** match the filters (defined in the next step).

11. Add filters, if you enabled a condition at step 8. Traffic must match (or not match, in the case of the IF NOT condition) the filters in order for the action to be applied. You can select one type of filter per ACL, or combine one IP filter and one HTTP header filter with an **AND** statement.
    - Click **+  Add IP filter(s** to add an IP filter. Enter an IPv4 or IPv6 address (or IP block) in the box that displays, and click **Add filter**. You can repeat this step to add as many IP addresses as you like. Any traffic from the source IP addresses specified here will be considered to match the filter.
    - Click **+  Add HTTP filter(s)** to add a HTTP filters. **Only frontends attached to an HTTP backend can add HTTP filters**. You can select **one** of the following filter types per ACL:
      - **Path begins with**: Enter a value to filter on, for example `/admin` and click **Add filter**. Repeat this step to add multiple values to filter for, if required. Any traffic which has any of the specified values at the beginning of its HTTP request path will be considered to match the filter.
      - **Path ends with**: Enter a value to filter on, for example `/blog` and click **Add filter**. Repeat this step to add multiple values to filter for, if required. Any traffic which has any of the specified values at the end of its HTTP request path will be considered to match the filter. 
      - **Path regex**: Enter a [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) to specify a pattern to search for in the HTTP request path, and click **Add filter**. Repeat this step to add multiple regex patterns to filter for, if required. Any traffic whose HTTP request path fits this regex will be considered to match the filter.
      - **Header**: Enter the **name** of the [HTTP header field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields) to use for the filter, and the **value** to filter for in this header, then click **Add filter**. For example, enter `Referer` followed by `exampledomain` to filter for occurrences of `exampledomain` in the `Referer` header. You can add  multiple values to filter for if required, but in only one header. Any traffic who has any of the specified values in the specified header field will be considered to match the filter.

12. Click **Create ACL** to finish. Your ACL is created, and you are redirected to the ACLs tab, where your new ACL now appears.

13. Repeat steps 5 to 11 to create new ACLs as required. Remember that they will be applied in order, according to the priority number you give each ACL.
    <Message type="tip">
      - Traffic filters through ACLS in order of priority, where the ACL with priority 1 (or the lowest given number) comes first, followed by the next highest number etc.
      - If traffic matches an ACL's filter for an **Allow**, **Deny** or **Redirect** action (or if the action is applied unconditionally by that ACL), the action is applied immediately. The traffic is not subject to any further filtering or any further actions by any ACLs that follow. 
      - Traffic that does **not** match criteria for the ACL's action will pass to the next ACL in the list, based on the order of priority.
      - If traffic reaches the end of the list of ACLs without having matched any filters to be explicitly allowed, denied or redirected, this traffic will be allowed pass to the backend.
      - **See our [reference documentation](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/acls) for more information on how ACLs work and how you can configure them for different use cases.**
