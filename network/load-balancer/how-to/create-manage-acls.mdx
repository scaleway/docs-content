An **A**ccess **C**ontrol **L**ist (ACL) is a list of permissions that control which traffic (based on source and destination IPs, or HTTPS information) is allowed to pass through your Load Balancer. This allows you to build extra security into your Load Balancer, and permit or deny access to the application(s) behind it.

## How to create ACLs

1. Click **Load Balancers** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. 
2. Click the Load Balancer you want to create ACLs for.
3. Click the **Frontends** tab.
4. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the frontend you want to create ACLs for, and select **Manage ACLs** from the dropdown list.
5. Click **Create an ACL**.
6. Enter the following information in the pop-up form:
    - **ACL name**: a name for your ACL
    - **Priority**: a priority number for your ACL. ACLs are dealt with in order of priority, starting from the lowest numbered rule.
    - **Protocol type**: choose `TCP` or `HTTPS`. If your backend protocol is TCP, you must select TCP here. If your backend protocol is HTTPS, you can select TCP **or** HTTPS.
    - **Control action**: Choose the action to take if your filters (path, header and/or IP) match.
        - `Allow if`: allow access if filter matches
        - `Allow unless`: allow access unless the filter matches
        - `Refuse if`: refuse access if the filter matches
        - `Refuse unless`: refuse access unless the filter matches
    - **IP list**: The IPs to filter for. You can add one/many invidual IPv4/IPv6 addresses, or one/many IP blocks. Enter the IP or IP block, click **Add IP** and continue until you have added all the IPs/blocks required.
    
    If you select the `HTTPS` protocol, an additional prompt appears, allowing you to filter on HTTPS data (paths or headers):   
      - **Filter type**: choose from `path_begin` to filter on the beginning of the URL, `path_end` to filter on the end of the URL or `regex` to filter on a regular expression to match in the URL, enter the value/s to match and click **Add Filter**. Repeat for as many filter types and values as you wish.
      - If you choose the `header` filter type, an additional prompt appears:
          - **Header name**: enter a header name to filter on (one max per ACL)
          - **Values**: enter the values to match in the specified header (as many as you wish) and click **Add filter** for each.
7. Click **Create ACL** to finish. You are redirected to the ACLs tab, where your new ACL now appears.
8. Repeat steps 5 and 6 to create new ACLs. Remember that they will be applied in order, according to the priority number you give each ACL.
    <Message type="tip">
      - ACLs are applied by the Load Balancer in order of priority, where the ACL with priority 1 (or the lowest given number) is applied first, followed by the next highest number etc.
      - An ACL which gives access to traffic based on the filter condition `allow if`, will therefore reject all traffic that does not match that filter condition.
      - Any ACLS further down the priority list that then attempt to give access to traffic that was already refused by a higher-priority rule, will therefore not be successful in allowing access. The traffic has already been refused.
      - You should therefore be careful in using the `allow if` and `refuse unless` actions with a high priority ACL that is part of a long list of ACLs. Depending on your use case, you may wish to favour the `allow unless` and `reject if` actions for high priority ACLs.

## How to edit ACLs

3. Click the **Frontends** tab.
4. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the frontend whose ACL(s) you want to edit, and select **Manage ACLs** from the dropdown list. The list of your ACLs displays.
5. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the ACL you wish to edit, and select **Edit**.
6. Edit the ACL as required, and click **Update ACL** to finish.

## How to delete ACLs

1. Click **Load Balancers** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. 
2. Click the Load Balancer you want to delete ACLs for.
3. Click the **Frontends** tab.
4. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the frontend whose ACL(s) you want to delete, and select **Manage ACLs** from the dropdown list. The list of your ACLs displays.
5. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the ACL you wish to edit, and select **Delete**.
6. Confirm the action by clicking **Delete this ACL**.
