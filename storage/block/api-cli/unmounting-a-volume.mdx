## Unmounting a Block Storage volume

It is important to unmount (detach) a device from the operating system using the `umount` command to avoid data loss before [removing the Block Storage volume](/storage/block/how-to/detach-a-volume/) from your machine.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key)
  - You have an [Instance](/compute/instances/concepts/#instance) with an additional Block Storage volume
</Message>

1. Open a terminal and connect to your Instance with `ssh`. Make sure you replace `<your_instance_ip>` with your Instance's public IP.
    ```
    ssh root@<your_instance_ip>
    ```
2. Use the following command to unmount your volume and remove it from your current setup. Make sure you add your own values.
    ```
    umount /mnt/block-volume
    ```
3.  Check that the volume is no longer mounted in the system with `lsblk`. An output similar to the following should display.
    ```
    root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# lsblk
    NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    sda       8:0    0 23.3G  0 disk
    vda     252:0    0 18.6G  0 disk
    ├─vda1  252:1    0 18.5G  0 part /
    └─vda15 252:15   0  100M  0 part /boot/efi
    ```

      Make sure you edit the `/etc/fstab` file and delete the line corresponding to your volume.

You can [mount](/storage/block/api-cli/managing-a-volume/#mounting-the-block-volume) the same volume again at any time.
Refer to the [dedicated documentation to mount and use a block volume](/storage/block/api-cli/managing-a-volume/) for more information.
