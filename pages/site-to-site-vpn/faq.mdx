## Overview

### What is Site-to-Site VPN?

Site-to-Site VPN lets you securely connect your Scaleway VPC to your remote infrastructure, enabling encrypted data exchange over a private VPN tunnel. Integrated with VPC routing, traffic destined for your remote infrastructure can reach it from your VPC via the secure VPN tunnel, and vice versa.

## Specifications

### How are Site-to-Site VPN tunnels encrypted?

Site-to-Site VPN connections are secured with Internet Protocol security (IPsec). When creating a VPN [connection](/site-to-site-vpn/reference-content/understanding-s2svpn/#connection), you are prompted to define a **security proposal** (aka IPSec proposal) which defines the precise encryption and authentication methods to secure the tunnel. Read more about security proposals and encryption in our [dedicated documentation](/site-to-site-vpn/reference-content/security-proposals/).

## Compatibility and integration

### Can I use Site-to-Site VPN to connect two Scaleway VPCs?

### Can I use Site-to-Site VPN to connect my Scaleway VPN to another cloud provider?

Yes, this use case is entirely possible.

## Pricing and billing
