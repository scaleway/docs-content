This page shows you how to modify a container's [privacy policy](/serverless/containers/concepts/#privacy-policy/), if you wish to do so after creation.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner/) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission/) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Deployed a container](/serverless/containers/how-to/deploy-a-container-from-scaleway-container-registry/)

<Message type="note">
  Setting a container to private will not take care of the actual authentication, as token validation is done at runtime. For further information, refer to the [developers documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-containers/#authentication/).
