## Quick & easy application creation with IoT Hub and IFTTT

IFTTT stands for "If This, then That". It is an easy to use yet powerful automation service where you can choose to perform an action upon an event. There are thousands of events and actions available and customizable. This is awesome.

In this article we will show you how to quickly build a simple reporting application which stores your devices data in a Google sheet.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />
 
## Create an IFTTT account and set up an applet

1. [Sign up](https://ifttt.com/) to IFTTT. When done click the create button to start building your applet.
2. Choose `Webhooks: Receive a web request` as the "If This" trigger. Type in `iot_event` as the event name and create the trigger.
3. Choose `Google Sheets: Add row to spreadsheet` as the "Then That" action. We will use default settings, just create the action without changing them.
4. Click the continue button

5. Choose a title, such as `Scaleway IoT Hub to Google Sheet` as your applet name and click Finish. You're done with the applet.

Now the applet is set-up, we need to find our webhook key, head to your [webhook settings](https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks/settings), you will find there an URL like `https://maker.ifttt.com/use/<key>`. Write down the key part, we will use it later.

## Creating an IoT Hub and setting up the IoT Route

Now that we have our IFTTT applet ready, we need to create an IoT Hub. This will be where our simulated IoT Device will publish messages to trigger our IFTTT applet.

1. Follow [this procedure](/managed-services/iot-hub/how-to/create-hub) to create an IoT Hub. Select your name and plan of choice, and click the `Create Hub` button.
2. Head to the Routes tab of your IoT Hub.
3. Create a new route with the following settings:
    - Name: anything you'd like (ex: `IFTTT Route`)
    - Topic: This will be the topic to publish to from your Device, let's use `my/data`
    - Route type: `REST Query`
    - Verb: `POST`
    - Endpoint: `https://maker.ifttt.com/trigger/iot_event/with/key/<key>` where `<key>` is the key you got from IFTTT earlier.
    - HTTP Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`

Now that we have everything set up, let's add a Device and send a message from there.

## Adding a Device a triggering the IFTTT applet

In your [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com), head to the `Devices` tab of your IoT Hub. From there, to add a new Device, give it any name and pick the `Allow insecure connection` option (you don't want to do that in production, but this is fine for this tutorial's purpose). Click the `Add` button, and, finally, the `Close` button.

Now your Device appears in the Device list, click it and then on the `MQTT Webclient` button to simulate a real device.

In the `Topic` field write `my/data` (which is the topic we chose for the IoT Route). In the `Message` field write `{ "value1" : "Hi", "value2" : "from", "value3" : "Scaleway!" }`. Then click the `Publish` button (no confirmation will be issued).

<Lightbox src="scaleway-iothub_ifttt_howto_webclient.webp" alt="" />

The message published on `my/data` topic will be received by the IoT Route and forwarded to the IFTTT Webhook trigger, which will save the values in the Google sheet.

Now head to your [Google sheet home page](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/), open the `IFTTT_Maker_Webhooks_Events` spreadsheet, and voila. You can even see data flowing in live when publishing more messages.

### All done

We hope you had fun collecting data from your IoT Hub to a Google sheet. This is one of the many possibilities the IoT Hub REST Route provides. Stay tuned for more REST Route usage examples.
