The Scaleway platform makes it very easy to migrate your data from one Instance to another, or upgrade your Instance to a more powerful one if your requirements grow. In this how-to, we will upgrade an Instance by migrating from a [DEV1-S](/compute/instances/concepts/#development-instance) Instance to a [GP1-XS](/compute/instances/concepts/#general-purpose-instance) Instance. The new GP1-XS Instance will have the same [flexible IP](/compute/instances/concepts/#flexible-ip) as the original DEV1-S Instance.

For more information about choosing the best Instance type to migrate to for your use case, see our [dedicated documentation](/compute/instances/reference-content/choosing-instance-type/).

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created your SSH key and added it to your account](/console/project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
  - You have [created an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance) (in our case, we created a DEV1-S Instance)
</Message>

## How to back up the Instance

Follow the instructions to [create an image](/compute/instances/how-to/create-a-backup/#how-to-create-an-image) of your Instance.

## How to create a new Instance from an image

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Instances page displays.
2. Click the Instance you created an image of.
3. Click the **Images** tab.
4. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the Instance's image.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-image-create-from-tab.webp" alt="" />
5. Select **Create Instance from image** on the drop-down list. You are redirected to the Instance Creation Wizard, where the image has been preselected for you at step 2.
6. Finish configuring the Instance according to your requirements. Notably:
    - You are free to choose your Instance type. We chose to create a [GP1-XS](/compute/instances/concepts/#general-purpose-instance) Instance, upgrading from the [DEV1-S](/compute/instances/concepts/#development-instance) on which the image was based.
    - Click **Advanced options** and use the <Icon name="toggle" /> toggle to deselect **flexible IP**. This creates the new Instance without a flexible IP, as we are going to attach the one from the existing Instance in the next step.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-toggle-flexip.webp" alt="" />
7. Click **Create Instance** to finish. The Instance is created and shows in your Instances list.

## How to move a flexible IP to a new Instance

Next, we will move the original DEV1-S Instance's [flexible IP address](/compute/instances/concepts/#flexible-ip) to the new GP1-XS Instance. 

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Instances page displays.
2. Click the **Flexible IPs** tab.
3. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the DEV1-S's flexible IP. In the pop-up menu that then displays, click **Switch Instance**.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-attach-flexip.webp" alt="" />
4. Select the GP1-XS Instance from the drop-down list, and click **Attach flexible IP to Instance**.

    The new Instance is now reachable via the old Instance's flexible IP.

## How to delete the old Instance

Presuming that you no longer need the original DEV1-S Instance, you can [delete it by following these instructions](/compute/instances/how-to/delete-instance)
