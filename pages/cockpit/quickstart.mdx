Scaleway's Observability Cockpit allows you to monitor your applications and their infrastructure by giving you insights and context into their behavior. With Cockpit, you can visualize your resources' and applications' metrics, logs, and traces in Grafana dashboards. Cockpit is automatically activated when you are using [Scaleway resources that are integrated into it](/cockpit/reference-content/cockpit-product-integration).

The Observability Cockpit provides you with [endpoints](/cockpit/concepts/#endpoints) to push [metrics](/cockpit/concepts/#metric), [logs](/cockpit/concepts/#logs), and [traces](/cockpit/concepts/#traces).

Learn [how to reduce extra costs and understand Cockpit pricing](/cockpit/reference-content/understanding-cockpit-usage/).

In this documentation, we show you how to create a push token to send metrics and logs to your Cockpit. We include tips to go further at the end of this Quickstart, to show you how you can configure the Grafana Alloy agent to push your metrics, logs, and traces to Cockpit and visualize your data in Grafana.

## Console overview
Discover the Cockpit interface on the Scaleway console.
<GuideFlow src="https://app.guideflow.com/embed/dr9l2vdcnr"/>

<Requirements />

  - A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

<Message type="important">
 - Having the default configuration on your agents might lead to more of your resources' metrics being sent, a high consumption, and a high bill at the end of the month.
 - Sending metrics and logs for Scaleway resources or personal data using an external path is a billable feature. In addition, any data that you push yourself is billed, even if you send data from Scaleway products. Refer to the [product pricing](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/managed-services/#cockpit) for more information.

## How to create a Cockpit token to push your metrics and logs

1. Click **Cockpit** in the **Monitoring** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Cockpit** overview page displays.
2. Click the **Tokens** tab.
3. Click **Create token**. A pop-up displays prompting you to create a token.
4. Choose the region to create the token in.
    <Message type="important">
     Make sure that you create your token in the same region as the [data sources](/cockpit/concepts/#data-sources) you want to use it for.
    </Message>
5. Choose a name for your token or use the already-generated name.
6. Select the permissions you wish to apply to your token.
    <Message type="important">
    You must select at least one permission.
    Permissions include:
    - **Push**: allows you to send your metrics, logs and traces to your Cockpit.
    - **Query**: allows you to fetch your metrics, logs and traces from your Cockpit.
    - **Rules**: allow you to configure alerting and recording rules.
    - **Alerts**: allow you to set up the alert manager.
    </Message>
7. Click **Create token** to confirm. A pop-up displays with your secret key. Make sure that you save the secret key before closing the pop-up.

## How to configure the alert manager

Enabling Scaleway's regionalized alert manager allows you configure preconfigured alerts for your Scaleway resources.

1. Click **Cockpit** in the **Monitoring** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Cockpit** overview page displays.
2. Click the **Alerts** tab.
3. Click the **Region** drop-down and select the desired region.
      <Message type="important">
        Make sure that you select the same region as the [data sources](/cockpit/concepts/#data-sources) you want to be alerted for.
      </Message>
4. Click **Enable alert manager** under the **Alert manager** section. A pop-up displays prompting you to configure alert notifications.
    <Message type="tip">
      Configuring alert notifications consists of two steps:
      - Enabling the alert manager, and
      - Adding contacts
      This allows the contacts to receive notifications whenever alerts you have configured are triggered.
    </Message>
5. Click **Enable alert manager** to confirm. The step for adding contacts displays.
6. Enter an email address, then click **+ Add email** and **Add contacts**. Your email address displays in the **Contacts** section, and by default, the **Resolved notifications** box is ticked. This means that you will receive notifications for resolved alerts.
7. Optionally, click **Skip for now** if you do not want to add contacts yet.
    <Message type="note">
     You are prompted to create contacts when enabling the alert manager for the first time, or when re-enabling it after disabling. However, you can also add or manage them independently from the alert manager configuration at any time.
    </Message>

## How to add contacts

You are prompted to create contacts when [enabling the alert manager](/cockpit/how-to/enable-alert-manager/) for the first time, or when re-enabling it after disabling. However, you can also perform this step independently from the alert manager configuration at any time.

1. Click **Cockpit** in the **Monitoring** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Cockpit** overview page displays.
2. Click the **Alerts** tab.
3. Click the **Region** drop-down and select the desired region.
    <Message type="important">
     Make sure that you select the same region as the [data sources](/cockpit/concepts/#data-sources) you want your contacts to be alerted for.
    </Message>
4. Click **Add email** in the **Contacts** section. A pop-up displays.
5. Enter an email address, then click **+ Add email**. Your email address displays and by default, the **Resolved notifications** checkbox is ticked. This means that you will receive notifications for resolved alerts.
6. Optionally, enter another email and click **+ Add email** to add another contact.
7. Click **Add contacts** to confirm. The email addresses appears in the list of your contacts.

  If you have not set up an agent yet, check out our [documentation](/cockpit/how-to/send-metrics-with-grafana-alloy/) to find out how to configure Grafana Alloy, push your metrics, and visualize them in Grafana.
  You must have created resources to monitor to push your data to Cockpit.
