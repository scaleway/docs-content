An Elastic Metal server can be reinstalled at any time from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com). This can be useful when you want to run a different image on the machine or if you want to have a fresh installation.

1. Click **Elastic Metal** in the **Bare Metal** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Elastic Metal dashboard displays.
2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the server you want to reinstall. A drop-down menu displays.
3. Click **Reinstall** in the menu to enter the installation wizard.
4. Choose the operating system that you want to install on the machine.
5. Add your [SSH key](/console/account/concepts/#ssh-key). If you have already [uploaded a key](/console/project/how-to/create-ssh-key/#how-to-upload-the-public-ssh-key-to-the-scaleway-interface), it displays in the list of keys. Choose the keys to grant access to the server by ticking or unticking the corresponding checkbox.
6. Click **Reinstall server** to launch the installation. It will take about 10 minutes to complete.
