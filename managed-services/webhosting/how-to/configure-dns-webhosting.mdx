To link your domain name with Web Hosting, you must update the DNS configuration of your domain name to use Scaleway's configuration. Once updated, you can verify the configuration to activate your Web Hosting plan.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Registered a domain name](/network/domains-and-dns/how-to/register-internal-domain/) at Scaleway or another registrar
- A Web Hosting plan

1. Click **Web Hosting** in the **Managed Services** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. The **Web Hosting** overview page displays.
2. Click <Icon name="seeMore" /> or the domain name of the Web Hosting plan you want to configure. The **Hosting information** page displays.
3. Click the **DNS Verification** tab. The DNS configuration page displays.
4. Update your DNS servers. Two options are available:
    - Use Scaleway's DNS servers.
        We provide DNS servers for your Web Hosting plan that contain all required DNS configuration. To use these nameservers, update the nameservers associated with your domain name with the servers provided by Scaleway.
    - Manual DNS configuration (advanced).
        If you prefer to continue using your current DNS servers, update the DNS zone at your registrar with all DNS records provided.
    <Message type="note">
        It can take 24 to 48 hours until your DNS updates have been propagated on the internet.
    </Message>
5. Click **Verify domain** once you have updated your DNS configuration. The DNS verification process will be launched.
