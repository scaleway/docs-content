## What is the difference between VPC and a Private Network?

One default VPC (**V**irtual **P**rivate **C**loud) for every available region is automatically created in each Scaleway [Project](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project). A VPC offers layer 3 network isolation.

Within each VPC, you can create multiple **Private Networks** and attach Scaleway resources to them, as long as the resources are in an AZ within the network's region. Attached resources can then communicate between themselves in an isolated and secure layer 2 network, away from the public internet.

In the future, VPC will allow you to define specific routing rules for your Private Networks, interconnect your VPC with other networks, define access control lists and more.

## Can two different Private Networks communicate with each other?

No. A Private Network is regional, spanning multiple AZs of the same region, but does not allow communication between two different Private Networks. In the future, we plan to release a feature to enable this. In the meantime, it is possible to define your own layer 3 router using a Public Gateway or an Instance connected to both Private Networks.

## What happened to my classic, mono-AZ Private Network?
When VPC and regional Private Networks moved from Public Beta to General Availability, all mono-AZ Private Networks were automatically migrated to be regional. This is a seamless process with no downtime, that should not require any extra configuration on the client side. [Read the documentation](/network/vpc/reference-content/vpc-migration/) to find out more about the migration process.

## Do resources' IP addresses on a Private Network risk changing when allocated by managed DHCP?

With managed DHCP, the IP is allocated when the resource is attached to a Private Network, and released only when the resource is detached or deleted. The IP address remains stable across reboots and long poweroffs, and will not change except upon deletion or detachment from the Private Network.

## How can I manage IP addresses for my Proxmox Virtual Machines on Elastic Metal servers?

If you are running multiple virtual machines on an Elastic Metal server, our [managed DHCP](/network/vpc/concepts/#dhcp) is not currently able to distribute IP addresses to these VMs. We recommend that you use the [Public Gateway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/public-gateway/#path-dhcp-entries-create-a-dhcp-entry) or other developer tools for Public Gateway, to make static DHCP reservations for your virtual machines on Elastic Metal. You can also use the [IPAM API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/ipam/#path-ips-book-a-new-ip) to reserve IPs, but note that with this method you will still need to manually configure the reserved IP addresses on your VMs, as you cannot associate the reserved IP address with a specific MAC address.
   
In the future, as we develop our public-facing [IPAM](/network/vpc/concepts/#ipam) functionality, we plan to make static IP reservations available via the Scaleway console.
