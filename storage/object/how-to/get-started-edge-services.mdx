- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization

## How to subscribe to Edge Services

To use Edge Services, you must subscribe to a [pricing plan](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/network/#edge-services). Within its monthly price, each pricing plan lets you create a certain number of pipelines and consume a certain amount of cache data.

Find out more about pricing plans and how to subscribe to Edge Services in our [dedicated documentation](/network/edge-services/how-to/subscribe-edge-services/).

## How to create an Edge Services pipeline

Once you have subscribed to Edge Services, you are ready to create a pipeline. Follow the steps below.

<Message type="tip">
You can create an Edge Services pipeline from the **Edge Services** section of the console, however, in this documentation, we describe how to create a pipeline directly from your bucket's dashboard in the **Objet Storage** section.
</Message>

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu.

2. Click the name of the bucket you want to create an Edge Services pipeline for.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-services-select-bucket.webp" alt="A screenshot of the Scaleway console shows a listing of Object Storage buckets, with an arrow showing that you click on the name of the bucket you want to enable Edge Services on." />

3. Click the **Edge Services** tab.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-edge-services-os-splash.webp" alt="A screenshot of the Scaleway console shows the Edge Services tab for the selected bucket: it is in an empty state, with a button inviting you to enable Edge Services." />

4. Click **Create pipeline**.

    A pop-up asks you to confirm that you want to create a pipeline to expose the bucket via Edge Services. 

5. Click **Create pipeline** to confirm.

    Edge Services is enabled on your bucket, and a pipeline is automatically created. Various features are now visible on the Edge Services tab, ready to be configured.

    <Message type="important">

    Your bucket's [visibility](/storage/object/concepts/#visibility) can be set to **private**, but any objects within it that you want to expose via Edge Services must be set to [**public** visibility](/storage/object/how-to/manage-object-visibility/). However, in the case that you are using Edge Services with bucket website, objects can remain private.

## How to access your bucket via Edge Services

Once you have created an Edge Services for your bucket, you can access your bucket and its content via its original Object Storage endpoint, and via its new customizable Edge Storage endpoint. Get full details in the [Edge Services](/network/edge-services/how-to/create-pipeline-bucket/#how-to-access-your-bucket-via-edge-services) section of the documentation.

## How to configure your pipeline

See the dedicated Edge Services section of the documentation for help with:

- [Customizing your Edge Services endpoint](/network/edge-services/how-to/configure-custom-domain/)
- [Configuring your Edge Services cache](/network/edge-services/how-to/configure-cache/)

To go further, browse our full range of Edge Services documentation on the [Edge Services Overview](/network/edge-services/) page.
