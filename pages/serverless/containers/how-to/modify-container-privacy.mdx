This page shows you how to modify a container's [privacy policy](/serverless-containers/concepts/#privacy-policy), if you wish to do so after creation.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Deployed a container](/serverless-containers/how-to/deploy-container/)

<Message type="note">
  Setting a container to private will not take care of the actual authentication, as token validation is done at runtime. For further information, refer to the [developers documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-containers/#authentication).
