You will find several types of content:

- **How-tos**: we explain how to create and manage all your resources from the Scaleway console.

- **Tutorials**: we explain how to use your Scaleway resources with third-party tools.

- **CLI documentation**: we explain how to manage your Scaleway resources in your code or command line.

- **Additional content**: we provide pertinent details about a specific subject.
