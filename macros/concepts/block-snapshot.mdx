A snapshot takes a picture of a specific volume at one point in time. For example, you may have a server with one volume containing the OS and another containing the application data and want to use different snapshot strategies on both volumes. [Creating snapshots of your volumes](/block-storage/how-to/create-a-snapshot/) gives you total freedom of which volumes you want to back up, while [images](#image) are more convenient for full backups of your Instance.
