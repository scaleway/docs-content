## Getting started with Kubernetes: Part 3 - Load Balancers

This is the third in a series of practical video tutorials to help users get started with Kubernetes in minutes. We walk you through Kubernetes fundamentals for beginners. 

In this video, we explain why you should add a load balancer service to your Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule, and walk you through how to do it.

First, we recap what we did in the previous two videos, and then look at why we should replace our NodeBalancer service from the last video with a LoadBalancer service.

Next, we show you how to create your LoadBalancer service with a yaml manifest and kubectl. The CloudController in the Control Plane takes care of creating your external Scaleway Load Balancer.

We then demonstrate how to find the external IP of your Load Balancer, either via the Scaleway console or by using kubectl, and how to check out your cluster's application using this IP address. 

The next and last video in this series will take a look at adding persistent storage for your cluster.

## Getting started with Kubernetes: Part 2 - Deloying an app with Kapsule

This is the second in a series of practical video tutorials to help users get started with Kubernetes in minutes. We walk you through Kubernetes fundamentals for beginners. 

In this video, we show you how to deploy a containerized application with the Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule.  

First, we review some key Kubernetes terminology (including pools, nodes and pods) and then demonstrate how to create a Kubernetes Kapsule via the Scaleway console. 

Next, we show you how to install kubectl so you can connect to your cluster from the command line of your local machine, and how to create an Image Pull Secret for your cluster. 

We then demonstrate how to deploy the containerized application (via the image created in the first video) to your Kapsule cluster. As a little extra, at the end we show how to use the k8s NodePort service to expose a port on the cluster's nodes so you can test that the application is running at its endpoint.

Future videos will cover topics like load balancing and storage for your Kubernetes application.

## Getting started with Kubernetes: Part 1 - Containers & Docker

This is the first in a new series of practical videos to help you get started with Kubernetes in minutes. We will walk you through Kubernetes fundamentals for beginners.

Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform, so before using it we need to understand a bit about containers themselves. A container is a portable package of software that includes its own environment and dependencies.

We show you how to containerize two simple applications with the popular containerization open-source platform Docker, starting from the Dockerfile to the basic docker commands with examples. Finally, we demonstrate how to safely push the container images we have created to the Scaleway Container Registry, so they are securely stored in the cloud.

Future videos will show you how to deploy your containerized application with the Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule, and cover topics like load balancing and storage for your Kubernetes application.
