Scaleway offers two managed Kubernetes solutions: Kapsule and Kosmos. While both serve the purpose of facilitating Kubernetes deployment and management, they cater to different needs and scenarios.
Below is a detailed comparison of the two services:

### Kubernetes Kapsule

Kapsule is Scaleway's **fully managed Kubernetes service**, enabling users to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications seamlessly without the burden of infrastructure management.

  - Available in multiple Scaleway regions (FR, AMS, WAW), allowing users to deploy applications closer to their target audience for enhanced performance.
  - Kosmos allows users to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications using Kubernetes without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.
  - Automatic scaling, rolling updates, and seamless integration with other Scaleway services like Load Balancers and Object Storage.
  - Users can manage their Kubernetes clusters through the Kubernetes API or the intuitive Scaleway console.

**Kapsule is ideal for:** Developers and organizations seeking to deploy containerized applications with Kubernetes without the operational overhead of managing Kubernetes infrastructure.

### Kubernetes Kosmos

Kosmos is Scaleway's **multi-cloud Kubernetes solution**, designed to operate across multiple cloud environments, empowering users to deploy applications on different cloud providers, thus offering flexibility and avoiding vendor lock-in.

  - Available in multiple Scaleway regions (FR, AMS, WAW), allowing users to deploy applications closer to their target audience for enhanced performance.
  - Offers dedicated control plane options, ensuring dedicated resources for managing Kubernetes clusters.
  - Supports various node pool types, including Scaleway instances (x86 and ARM architecture) and external providers, providing users with options to tailor node configurations according to their application needs.
  - Uses the Kilo Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin for efficient networking within Kubernetes clusters.

**Kosmos is ideal for:** Users requiring multi-cloud deployment capabilities, flexibility in node configurations, and enhanced control over Kubernetes clusters.
