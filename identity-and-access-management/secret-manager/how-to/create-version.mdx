When creating a secret, its value is stored in its first version, which is [enabled](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#enabling-a-version) by default. At creation, your secret only has one version.

This page explains how to add more [versions](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#version) to a secret using the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Generated an API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) and enabled the `SecretManagerFullAccess` [permission set](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/permission-sets/)
- Created a [secret](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/how-to/create-secret/)

1. Click **Secret Manager** in the **Security and Identity** section of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu.
2. Select the [region](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#region) in which the secret you want to update is, in the **Region** drop-down.
3. Access the secret that you want to add a version to. Your secret's **Overview** tab displays.
4. Click the **Versions** tab.
5. Click **+ Create version**. A pop-up displays.
6. Add your version manually or import it from a file.
7. Click the <Icon name="toggle" /> icon if you want to [enable](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/concepts/#enabling-a-version) the version.
8. Click **Create version**.
