This page shows you how to change the [retention](/cockpit/concepts/#retention) period for your data sources.

<Message type="important">
  On January 1st, 2025, Cockpit pricing plans were deprecated and replaced by the custom [retention](/cockpit/concepts/#retention) feature, available for free during beta.
  On May 1st, 2025, this feature reaches general availability and becomes billable. Refer to the [Cockpit FAQ](/cockpit/faq/) to find out about new pricing.

         - Reducing the retention period of a data source will permanently delete all observability data in that data source beyond the selected timeframe. This deletion is irreversible and takes effect a few minutes after the retention period is reduced, even if the retention period is later increased.
         - Find out about the [retention periods available for each data source type](/cockpit/concepts/#retention).
         - Adjusting data retention beyond the default period is billed based on the volume of data stored. Check the [Cockpit FAQ](/cockpit/faq/) for information on data retention billing.
