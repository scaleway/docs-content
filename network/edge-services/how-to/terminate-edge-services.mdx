Edge Services is an additional feature for Scaleway Load Balancers and Object Storage buckets. It lets you  benefit from a powerful caching service to reduce the load on your origin servers and streamline delivery. On top of this, you get a customizable Edge Services endpoint and can set it to a subdomain of your choice, securing it with an SSL/TLS certificate. To use Edge Services, you must subscribe to a monthly plan.
