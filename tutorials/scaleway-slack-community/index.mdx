## Slack - Overview

By joining Scaleway's Slack workspace, you can conveniently communicate with their teams and other members of the Scaleway community regarding your ongoing projects on the Scaleway infrastructure. You can share insights, engage in discussions on diverse subjects, and exchange creative ideas.

## Signing up to Slack

1. Access the [Scaleway homepage](https://www.scaleway.com/en/) and on the bottom, click **Chat Room** or access it directly via [this link](https://slack.scaleway.com/).

Slack suggests different steps such as sending someone a message, adding a profile picture or joining channels, to get started. You can check out the different options before following the next step.

## Joining a channel

Channels are persistent chat rooms used for discussing specific topics and projects between peers. On the Scaleway Slack Community, you will find channels dedicated to each product and service of the Scaleway ecosystem, as well as the community channel for general discussions.

1. By default, you are added to the **#community** and **#community-fr** channels. Click the word **Channels** to browse our catalogue and find others you would like to join.
2. You can sort them by _Channel name_, _Creation date (newest first)_, _Members (most to fewest)_ or _Members (fewest to most)_ and select which ones you want displayed: _All channels_, _Private channels_ or _Archived channels_. Select a Channel and click to visualise it.
3. On the bottom of your workspace you will be given the option to **Join Channel** or **See More Details**. Click **Join Channel** to be able to participate in it and write messages.
