## Kubeflow - Overview

[Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/) provides several modules to handle different Machine Learning / Deep Learning workloads. Its intention is not the recreation of services, but to provide a simple and straightforward way to deploy well-established open-source systems on Kubernetes.

In this tutorial you will learn how to deploy Kubeflow and its services on [Kubernetes Kapsule](/containers/kubernetes/concepts/#kubernetes-kapsule), the managed Kubernetes service from Scaleway.

</Message>

## Creating a Kubernetes Kapsule cluster

1. Log in into your [account](https://console.scaleway.com). 
2. Click **Kubernetes** on the side menu. The Kubernetes section displays.
3. Click **Create a cluster** to create a new Kubernetes cluster.
    - **Choose your cluster type**: Choose a Kubernetes Kapsule cluster.
    - **Choose a region**: Choose the region in which you want your cluster to be created. A region refers to the geographical location in which your cluster will be created.
    - **Choose a Kubernetes Version**: Select the Kubernetes version for the cluster. Choose the latest version from the drop-down list.
    - **Enter a Name for the Cluster**: Name your cluster or leave the automatically generated name. 
    - Keep the default values in the `Advanced Options` section.
    - Click **Next** to configure your pool.
    - **Choose a zone**: An [Availability Zone (AZ)](/compute/instances/concepts/#availability-zone) refers to the geographical location in which all your pool's nodes will be created.
    - **Select a node type**: Choose the node type. We will be using `GP1-M` Instances for this tutorial (16 cores, 64 GB RAM).
    - **Configure node options**:
      - Enable the autoscale feature.
      - Enter the minimum and maximum number of nodes available for the pool. Choose a minimum of **1 node** and a maximum of **2 nodes**. 

    <Message type="note">
      If you choose an under-dimensioned configuration for your base cluster, and you later add GPU nodes to your pool with autoscaling, you may have problems with automatic downscaling of the GPU nodes. This can happen when  Kubeflow system pods deployed on the GPU nodes prevent downscaling, due to the high CPU/memory pressure on the CPU nodes.
    </Message>
4. Click **Create a cluster** to launch the cluster's creation. Once it is ready, your cluster's details display:

## Installing kubectl on your local computer

`kubectl` is the Kubernetes command line tool, allowing you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. You can use `kubectl` from a terminal on your local computer to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs. The application is available for MacOS, Windows and various Linux distributions. You can find detailed installation information for the tool on the [Kubernetes website](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).

1. Download the latest release of the binary with the following command:
    **On MacOS:**

    ```
    curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl"
    ```

    **On Windows:**

    ```
    curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/v1.23.0/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe"
    ```

    **On Linux:**

    ```
    curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
    ```
2. Make the downloaded binary executable.
    ```
    chmod +x ./kubectl
    ```
3. Move the `kubectl` in to your PATH.
    ```
    sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
    ```
4. Test to ensure the version you installed is up-to-date:
    ```
    kubectl version --client
    ```

## Configuring the connection to your cluster

A `.kubeconfig` file is generated during your cluster's creation. Download the file to manage your Kubernetes Kapsule cluster using the `kubectl` command-line tool from your local computer.

1. Click on **Download file** to download your `.kubeconfig` file in the cluster information page:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubeflow_kapsule_console_kubeconfig.webp" alt="" />
2. Set the downloaded file as configuration file for your cluster.
3. Configure the `kubectl` program. Make sure you replace `/$HOME/Downloads/kubeconfig-ClusterName.yaml` with the path of your downloaded .kubeconfig file.
    ```

    cp $HOME/Downloads/Kubeconfig-ClusterName.yaml $HOME/.kube/config
    kubectl get nodes
    ```
4. Click **Dashboard** in your cluster's **Overview** page, to open the Kubernetes dashboard of your cluster in a new browser window.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubernetes-cluster.webp" alt="" />
5. The Kubernetes dashboard displays. You can inspect the components and their status from it:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubeflow_kubedash_overview.webp" alt="" />

## Deploying Kubeflow with kfctl_k8s_istio

`kfctl_k8s_istio` allows you to deploy Kubeflow on an existing Kubernetes cluster. We will use this method to install Kubeflow on your Kapsule cluster. The following example is for MacOS X. The steps might be slightly different on other operating systems. You may refer to the [official documentation](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs//) for more information.

1. Download the latest kfctl release from the [Kubeflow releases page](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfctl/releases), and install the `kfctl` binary. In our example we use the version 1.2.0:
    ```
    mkdir -p ~/bin
    export PATH=$PATH:~/bin
    mkdir -p ~/kubeflow
    cd  ~/kubeflow

    curl -L -o ~/bin/kfctl_v1.2.0-0-gbc038f9_darwin.tar.gz https://github.com/kubeflow/kfctl/releases/download/v1.2.0/kfctl_v1.2.0-0-gbc038f9_darwin.tar.gz
    tar xvf ~/bin/kfctl_v1.2.0-0-gbc038f9_darwin.tar.gz -C ~/bin/
    chmod u+x ~/bin/kfctl
    ```
2. Run a test to ensure you have installed the latest version of `kfctl`:
    ```
    kfctl version
    ```
3. Set several environment variables to make the deployment easier:
    ```bash
    # Set KF_NAME to the name of your Kubeflow deployment. You also use this
    # value as directory name when creating your configuration directory.
    # For example, your deployment name can be 'my-kubeflow' or 'kf-test'.
    export KF_NAME=kubeflow

    # Set the path to the base directory where you want to store one or more
    # Kubeflow deployments. For example, /opt/.
    # Then set the Kubeflow application directory for this deployment.
    export BASE_DIR=${HOME}/kubeflow-cluster
    export KF_DIR=${BASE_DIR}/${KF_NAME}

    # Set the configuration file to use when deploying Kubeflow.
    # The following configuration installs Istio by default.
    export CONFIG_URI="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/manifests/v1.2-branch/kfdef/kfctl_k8s_istio.v1.2.0.yaml"
    ```
4. Deploy Kubeflow:
    ```
    mkdir -p ${KF_DIR}
    cd ${KF_DIR}
    kfctl apply -V -f ${CONFIG_URI}
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      You can monitor the deployment of Kubeflow from the Kubernetes dashboard (in the Kubeflow namespace) or by using the following command: `kubectl get pods -n kubeflow`
    </Message>

## Accessing the Kubeflow dashboard

Kubeflow comes with a graphical interface that provides quick access to all Kubeflow components deployed in your cluster. The dashboard includes features such as:

- Shortcuts to specific actions and metrics, providing you a quick overview of your jobs and the status of your cluster in one view.
- A centralized place for the UIs of components running in the cluster, including Pipelines, Notebooks, Katib, and more.
- A registration flow guiding new users to set up their namespace if neccessary.

1. Use the following command to set up port-forwarding to the Istio gateway.
    ```
    kubectl port-forward -n istio-system svc/istio-ingressgateway 8080:80
    ```
2. Type the following URL in the address bar of your web browser to access the Kubeflow dashboard: http://localhost:8080/
3. In order to use Kubeflow, a namespace for your account must be created the first time you access the Dashboard. Namespace. A namespace is a collection of Kubeflow services. Resources created within a namespace are isolated to that namespace. Upon your first connection you will be guided to create a new namespace. Click **Start Setup**:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubeflow_kfdash_setup.webp" alt="" />

    Enter a name for your new namespace, in our example we use `kubeflow-user` and click **Finish**:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubeflow_kfdash_namespace.webp" alt="" />
4. The Kubeflow dashboard displays. Select the `kubeflow-user` namespace from the drop-down list on the top left corner before continuing with the next step:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubeflow_kfdash_overview.webp" alt="" />

## Launching a Jupyter Notebook server

1. Click **Notebook Servers** in the Kubeflow dashboard:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubeflow_kfdash_notebook_server.webp" alt="" />
2. A list of your Jupyter Notebook servers displays. Click **New Server** to launch the server creation wizard.
3. Enter the details of your new Juypter Notebook server:
    - **Name:** A name for your server, for example `jupyter-server`
    - **Image:** Select a CPU Jupyter Docker image with a baseline deployment and typical Machine Learning packages such as Tensorflow and Pytorch. We use the image `tensorflow-2.1.0-notebook-cpu:1.0.0` in this tutorial.
    - **CPU/RAM:** Configure the total amount of CPU und RAM reserved by your Notebook server. In this tutorial we set the value for CPU to `4` and set the available memory for the server to `8.0Gi`.
    - **Workspace Volume** Configure the type, name, size and mode for the workspace volume. In this example we create a new 300Gi volume named `workspace-jupyter` and the mode `ReadWriteOnce`

    Your configuration should look as the following example:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubeflow_kfdash_jupyter_new.webp" alt="" />

    <Message type="note">
    With Kubeflow Pipelines, the Jupyter server does not need to run on a GPU node (but the pipeline's task might be executed on GPU nodes). However if you want to add GPU to your server, don't forget to add a GPU node pool to your cluster.

    </Message>
4. Click **Launch** to create the new Jupyter Notebook server.
5. Once the server is ready, click **Connect** to open Jupyter Notebook in a new browser tab.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubeflow_kfdash_connect.webp" alt="" />
6. Check the Persistent Volumes section of your cluster from the Kubernetes Dashboard. You will notice that a new 300 Gi Block Storage volume has been created for Jupyter:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubeflow_kubedash_pervolume.webp" alt="" />

## Adding a GPU node pool

<Message type="tip">
  Using a GPU pool configured with autoscaling from 0 nodes to the max number of nodes you want, is a great way to optimize you costs, as Kapsule will automatically spawn GPU Instances when needed, and remove these GPU Instances when not used.
</Message>

1. Click the **Pools** tab of your clusters information page in the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com/kapsule/)
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubeflow_scwconsole_pools.webp" alt="" />
2. Click **+ Add a pool** to add a new pool:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubeflow_scwconsole_addpool.webp" alt="" />
3. Enter the details of the new pool
    - **Pool name:** A name to identify the pool, we use `gpu-pool` in our example.
    - **Autoscale the number of nodes** Enable this option and configure the minimum number of nodes to 0 and the maximum number of nodes to 2. With autoscaling enabled a GPU node will only be added when needed.

    <Message type="note">
      It takes a few minutes to spawn the instance. When a GPU node is not being used for around 10-15 minutes, the node is being removed. In this case, you will no longer be able to access the pods log of a past Kubeflow pipeline task execution that has been executed on the deleted node.
    </Message>

    Your configuration should look like the following example:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubeflow_scwconsole_newpool.webp" alt="" />
4. Click **Add a new pool** to confirm.
5. The newly created pool `gpu-pool` displays in the list of your clusters pools. You can add it to Kubeflow now:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubeflow_scwconsole_poollist.webp" alt="" />

## Adding Block Storage to store datasets & models

In our example, we will create a 300Gi Block storage volume to store our datasets and models. You may want to adjust this values (In that case, take care to make the changes at 3 locations in the below K8S manifests):

<Message type="note">
  In the following examples we assume our namespace is called `kubeflow`.
</Message>

**Adding a NFS server (ReadWriteMany) using Block Storage Storage**

1. Configure a nfs-pv `PersistentVolumeClaim`:
    ```bash
    cat > ./scw_pvc.yaml <<- "EOF"
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    metadata:
      name: nfs-pv
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 300Gi
    EOF

    kubectl create -f scw_pvc.yaml -n kubeflow
    ```
2. Setup a nfs-server Replication Controller
    ```bash
    cat > ./nfs-server-rc.yaml <<- "EOF"
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ReplicationController
    metadata:
      name: nfs-server
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        role: nfs-server
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            role: nfs-server
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: nfs-server
            image: k8s.gcr.io/volume-nfs:0.8
            ports:
              - name: nfs
                containerPort: 2049
              - name: mountd
                containerPort: 20048
              - name: rpcbind
                containerPort: 111
            securityContext:
              privileged: true
            volumeMounts:
              - mountPath: /exports
                name: mypvc
          volumes:
            - name: mypvc
              persistentVolumeClaim:
                claimName: nfs-pv
    EOF

    kubectl create -f nfs-server-rc.yaml -n kubeflow
    ```
3. Setup a `nfs-server` service
    ```bash
    cat > ./nfs-server-service.yaml <<- "EOF"
    kind: Service
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
      name: nfs-server
    spec:
      ports:
        - name: nfs
          port: 2049
        - name: mountd
          port: 20048
        - name: rpcbind
          port: 111
      selector:
        role: nfs-server
    EOF

    kubectl create -f nfs-server-service.yaml -n kubeflow
    ```
4. Setup a nfs `PersistentVolume`
    ```bash
    cat > ./nfs-pv.yaml.tmp <<- "EOF"
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolume
    metadata:
      name: nfs
    spec:
      capacity:
        storage: 300Gi
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteMany
      nfs:
        # replace the following ip with your NFS IP
        server:  REPLACE_IP
        path: "/"
    EOF

    export NFS_IP=$(kubectl get svc nfs-server -n kubeflow -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}')
    sed "s/REPLACE_IP/$NFS_IP/" ./nfs-pv.yaml.tmp > ./nfs-pv.yaml

    kubectl create -f nfs-pv.yaml -n kubeflow
    ```
5. Configure a nfs `PersistentVolumeClaim`
    ```bash
    cat > ./nfs-pvc.yaml <<- "EOF"
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    metadata:
      name: nfs
    spec:
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteMany
      storageClassName: ""
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 300Gi
    EOF

    kubectl create -f nfs-pvc.yaml -n kubeflow
    ```

    The NFS server is configured now. In the next steps, configure Kubeflow to be able to write to this volume:
6. Open a shell on the NFS server pod:
    ```bash
    NFSPOD=`kubectl -n kubeflow get pods --selector=role=nfs-server| tail -1 | awk '{print $1}'`
    kubectl -n kubeflow exec -it $NFSPOD -- bash
    ```
7. Create and configure a data directory in the pod:
    ```bash
    cd exports/
    mkdir data
    chown -R 1000:100 data
    exit
    ```

## Accessing NFS storage using Block Storage

1. Create a `nfs_access.yaml` file
    ```bash
    cat > ./nfs_access.yaml <<- "EOF"
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nfs-access
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: bash
        image: bash:latest
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-ec", "while :; do echo '.'; sleep 5 ; done"]
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/mnt/nfs"
          name: workdir
      volumes:
      - name: workdir
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: nfs
    EOF
    ```
2. Create a Pod from this specifications:
    ```
    kubectl apply -f nfs_access.yaml -n kubeflow
    ```
3.  Connect with a shell to this pod:
    ```bash
    kubectl exec -t —i -n kubeflow nfs-access -- /bin/sh
    # you can explore the /mnt directory from here
    alias ll=‘ls -la'
    cd /mnt/nfs/data/
    ```

    <Message type="note">
      There is no command prompt on this pod.
    </Message>

    In a similar manner, you can use the `kubectl cp `command to copy data from/to the PVC

    You can use the NFS volume in your Kubeflow pipeline as follows:

    ```
    @dsl.pipeline(
        name="My pipeline ",
        description="A toy example to show how to use GPU and NFS storage in a pipeline composed of one single task"
    )
    def my_pipeline():
        def mount_nfs_helper(container_op):
            ''' Helper Function to mount a NFS Volume to the ContainerOp task'''
            # NFS PVC details
            claim_name='nfs'
            name='workdir'
            mount_path='/mnt/nfs'
            # Add and Mount the NFS volume to the ContainerOp
            nfs_pvc = k8s_client.V1PersistentVolumeClaimVolumeSource(claim_name=claim_name)
            container_op.add_volume(k8s_client.V1Volume(name=name,
                                                  persistent_volume_claim=nfs_pvc))
            container_op.add_volume_mount(k8s_client.V1VolumeMount(mount_path=mount_path, name=name))
            return container_op
        # A Pipeline's task
        my_task = my_container_op(...)
        my_task = mount_nfs_helper(my_task)  # Mount NFS server when executing this task
        my_task.set_gpu_limit(1)             # Execute  this task on a node with 1 GPU
    ```

    For more information on Kubeflow pipelines refer to the [official documentation](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/sdk/).
4. Delete the data-access pods when you have finished
    ```
    kubectl delete -n kubeflow -f nfs_access.yaml
    ```

## Deleting the NFS server

In case you are no longer in need for the data stored on the Block Storage volume, you can delete the NFS server by using the following command:

<Message type="important">
  This will delete both your Data on the volume and the Block Storage Volume itself. This progress is irreversible.
</Message>

```
kubectl delete -f nfs-pvc.yaml -n kubeflow
kubectl delete -f nfs-pv.yaml -n kubeflow
kubectl delete -f nfs-server-service.yaml -n kubeflow
kubectl delete -f nfs-server-rc.yaml -n kubeflow
kubectl delete -f scw_pvc.yaml -n kubeflow
```
