The **S3 failover** feature allows you to redirect users to a static website hosted on Scaleway Object Storage, in the case that none of your Load Balancer's backends are available. This website could be a simple, single webpage or else something much more complex: you build it according to your own requirements. You can set up an S3 failover during creation of your Load Balancer, or at any point after creation. 

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have created a bucket which is hosting a [bucket website](/storage/object/how-to/use-bucket-website/)
</Message>

## How to activate S3 failover during creation of your Load Balancer

1. Follow the instructions for [creating a Load Balancer](/network/load-balancer/how-to/create-load-balancer/).
2. Click the  **+Advanced Settings** button after step 5 of the creation wizard.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-s3-failover.webp" alt="" />
3. Slide the <Icon name="toggle" /> toggle to activate S3 failover, and enter a Scaleway Object Storage [Bucket Website](/storage/object/concepts/#bucket-website) URL in the **S3 link** box. Note that the URL of the bucket endpoint is not sufficient, the bucket website URL is specifically required (e.g.`https://my-bucket.s3-website.nl-ams.scw.cloud`).
    <Message type="note">
      The S3 failover feature is only available for Load Balancers using the HTTP protocol on their backend.
