The AWS-CLI is an open-source tool built on top of the AWS SDK for Python (Boto) that provides commands for interacting with AWS services. With minimal configuration, you can start using all of the functionalities provided by the AWS Management.

## How to install the AWS-CLI

The AWS-CLI is an open-source tool built on top of the AWS SDK for Python (Boto) that provides commands for interacting with AWS services. With minimal configuration, you can start using all of the functionality provided by the AWS Management.

To interact with Object Storage, `aws-cli` and `awscli-plugin-endpoint` need to be installed. The `awscli-plugin-endpoint` is a great plugin to help people more easily access third-party S3 providers.

1. Install `aws-cli` and `awscli-plugin` using `pip`.
    ```
    pip3 install awscli
    pip3 install awscli-plugin-endpoint
    ```
2. Create the file `~/.aws/config` by running the following command:
    ```
    aws configure set plugins.endpoint awscli_plugin_endpoint
    ```
3. Open `~/.aws/config` in a text editor and edit it as follows:
    ```
    [plugins]
    endpoint = awscli_plugin_endpoint

    [default]
    region = nl-ams
    s3 =
      endpoint_url = https://s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud
      signature_version = s3v4
      max_concurrent_requests = 100
      max_queue_size = 1000
      multipart_threshold = 50MB
      # Edit the multipart_chunksize value according to the file sizes that you want to upload. The present configuration allows to upload files up to 10 GB (1000 requests * 10MB). For example setting it to 5GB allows you to upload files up to 5TB.
      multipart_chunksize = 10MB
    s3api =
      endpoint_url = https://s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud
    ```
    You can also configure additional profiles by adding new blocks under `[default]`. For example, you can add a second profile, `[profile two]`, to set a different region and endpoint from your default one:
    
    ``` 
    [plugins]
    endpoint = awscli_plugin_endpoint

    [default]
    region = nl-ams
    s3 =
      endpoint_url = https://s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud
    s3api =
      endpoint_url = https://s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud

    [profile two]
    region = fr-par
    s3 =
      endpoint_url = https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud
    s3api =
      endpoint_url = https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud
    ```

    <Message type="important">
      If you are using the AWS-CLI v2, you must include the path to the plugin in your configuration file. Add `cli_legacy_plugin_path = <path-to-plugin>` to the `[plugins]` section, replacing `<path-to-plugin>` with the corresponding path. 
    </Message>

    <Message type="note">
      Set the `endpoint_url` and `region` corresponding to the geographical region of your bucket. It can either be `fr-par` (Paris, France), `nl-ams` (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) or `pl-waw` (Warsaw, Poland).

4. Generate a credentials file using the command:
    ```
    aws configure
    ```
5. Open the `~/.aws/credentials` file and configure your [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) as follows:
    ```
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id=<ACCESS_KEY>
    aws_secret_access_key=<SECRET_KEY>
    ```
    If you have other profiles, add a block to indicate their credentials.
    
    ```
    [two]
    aws_access_key_id=<ACCESS_KEY>
    aws_secret_access_key=<SECRET_KEY>
    ```
6. Test your cluster.
    ```
    aws s3 ls
    ```
    Use the `--profile` option if you want to test it using a different profile. Remember to replace `two` with the name of your profile. 
    ```
    aws --profile two s3 ls
    ```
