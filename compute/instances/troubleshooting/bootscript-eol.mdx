Some legacy Instance types (e.g. **VC1-x**, **X64-x**, **Start1-x**) supported the option to use a bootscript (a preconfigured boot configuration) to start your Instance. This boot method was also available on **DEV1-x**, **GP1-x**, and **STARDUST1** Instances. This feature is now deprecated and will no longer be supported.
If you are still using one of these Instance types with a bootscript, you have to change your boot configuration in order to keep your Instance operational.

You can find information about the Instances quotas allocated to your account at the following link: [Understanding Organization quotas](/console/account/reference-content/organization-quotas/).


<Message type="note">
  If you want to keep using legacy Instance types, you will not be able to create them through the console interface. However, you can still create them using the [Scaleway CLI](/compute/instances/api-cli/creating-managing-instances-with-cliv2/) as you normally would or through the [Instances API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/#path-instances-create-an-instance), as long as you stay within your allocated quotas. [Check your Organization's quota usage in the Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/organization/settings).

  To ensure the continued stability of your service, it is crucial to follow the procedures outlined below, as the bootscript feature enters the decommissioning phase. Failure to do so may result in service instability for your Instances.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created your SSH key and added it to your account](/console/project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
  - You have [an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance) using a bootscript

## How do I know if I am impacted?

If your Instance is using the bootscript option to boot in normal mode you are impacted. You can check which boot mode is used by your Instance directly in the Scaleway console.

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The [Instances page](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) displays.
2. Click the name of the Instance you want to check. The Instance overview displays.
3. Click the **Advanced Settings** tab.
4. Check the **Boot Mode** of your Instance. If it uses **local boot** you are not concerned by the migration. If you are using a **bootscript** your intervention is required.

## Migration options for Instances using bootscripts

<Message type="important">
  Local volume(s) that do not support UEFI cannot be used to boot any other type of Instance. You must retrieve and migrate manually your data to an Instance that supports UEFI boot.  
  Unfortunately, Scaleway cannot access your data to identify if you are using an OS image with or without UEFI partitions.
  To do so, [connect to your Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance) using SSH and run the following command to list the EFI directories:
  ```
  ls -ld /sys/firmware/efi
  ```
  If you can see the following output, your Instance uses UEFI boot:
  ```
  root@my-virtual-instance:~# ls -ld /sys/firmware/efi
  drwxr-xr-x 6 root root 0 Feb 20 11:16 /sys/firmware/EFI
  ```
  In this case, use **option 1** to migrate your Instance.
  If you see `ls: cannot access /sys/firmware/efi: No such file or directory`, the UEFI directories are not present on your Instance. Migrate your data using options **2**, **3**, or **4**.

    #### Change the boot type of the Instance to local boot

    <Message type="tip">
      This option is the **recommended** procedure for most Instance types.
    </Message>
  
    **This section applies if your Instance supports UEFI boot.** To continue using your current Instance, [change the boot type](/compute/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes/#how-to-use-local-boot) of the Instance to **Local boot**:

    1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The [Instances page](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/servers) displays.
    2. Click the Instance you wish to start with a local boot.
    3. Use the toggle <Icon name="toggle" /> icon in the top right corner of the screen to **power off** your Instance.
    4. Click the **Advanced settings** tab.
    5. In the **Boot mode** section, select **Use local boot**.
    6. Click **Save**.
    7. Use the toggle <Icon name="toggle" /> icon in the top right corner of the screen to **power on** your Instance.
        Your Instance starts using local boot.
    8. Check that the Instance is booting correctly with the local boot method and that its services are behaving correctly.

    <Message type="note">
      * If changing the boot type from bootscript to local boot is not successfully achieved via option 1, you can always use options 2, 3 or 4 to migrate your Instance data to a new one.
      * If you are a **STARDUST1** user, we recommend that you put your VM into [standby mode](/compute/instances/how-to/use-standby-mode/). This ensures your Instance will not lose its slot in the case of availability shortages.

      #### Create a unified snapshot of the volume(s) and rebuild block volume(s) from the snapshot.

      This section explains how to create a new instance from an OS image which supports Local Boot using UEFI and how to access your data on the newly created Instance.

      <Message type="note">
        This is the recommended procedure if your Instance **does not support UEFI**. Most of the existing **VC1-x**, **X64-x**, and **Start1-x** Instances fall into this category.
      </Message>

      1. [Create a snapshot](/compute/instances/how-to/create-a-snapshot/) of the volume using the **unified** snapshot type.
      2. [Create a new block volume](/storage/block/how-to/create-a-volume) from the previous unified snapshot.
      3. [Create and start](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) a new Instance using its own boot volume in local boot mode. Make sure the Instance is in the same zone as the volume.
      4. [Attach](/storage/block/how-to/attach-a-volume/) the block volume to the new Instance.
      5. Once logged into the Instance, [mount the partition](/storage/block/api-cli/managing-a-volume/#mounting-the-block-volume/) available in the block volume and access your data.
      6. Delete the old Instance that was using a bootscript once the migration is completed.

  <TabsTab label="Option 3">

      #### Create a snapshot of the volume(s) and export it to S3 to retrieve the data

      1. [Create a snapshot](/compute/instances/how-to/create-a-snapshot/) of the volume using the **unified** or **l_ssd** type of snapshot.
      2. [Export](/compute/instances/how-to/snapshot-import-export-feature) the snapshot to an S3 bucket in the same region as the Instance.
      3. Retrieve your data from the Object Storage bucket and reuse it at your convenience.
      4. Delete the old Instance that was using a bootscript once you have recovered your data.

  </TabsTab>
  <TabsTab label="Option 4">

    #### Create a new Instance using the local boot method and manually copy data from the old Instance to the new one.

    Migrate the data of your old Instance manually. For example, you can do this by using FTP, SCP, or Rsync.
