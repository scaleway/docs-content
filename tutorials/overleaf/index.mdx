Overleaf is a collaborative writing and publishing system that uses LaTeX, a typesetting software that allows for the creation of structured, professional documents online.
It is particularly favored by academics and professionals for producing scientific documents, research papers, theses, and presentations due to its precise formatting and styling capabilities. Overleaf also supports real-time collaboration between multiple authors.

## Installing Overleaf community edition

1. Connect to your Instance using SSH.
    ```
    ssh root@<YOUR-INSTANCE-IP>
    ```
2. Use `git` to downlaoad the Overleaf code repoisitory.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit.git /opt/overleaf-toolkit
    ```
3. Enter the Overleaf `overleaf-toolkit` directory.
    ```
    cd /opt/overleaf-toolkit
    ```
4. Run the following command to copy the configuration files
    ```
    ./bin/init
    ```
5. Download and start the Overleaf container and its requirements
    ```
    ./bin/up
    ```
    <Message type="tip">
      * If a web server is already running on port 80, be sure to stop it before executing the above command.
      * Dowloading and configuring the application for the first start may take some time.
    </Message>
6. Stop the application by pressing `CTRL+C`.
7. Open the file `./config/overleaf.rc` in a text editor and edit the `NGINX_HTTP_PORT=80` line . Set the value to `NGINX_HTTP_PORT=8877`, then save the file and exit the editor.

## Configuring a systemd script

Once Overleaf runs correctly, you can create a systemd daemon service.

1. Create and open the `/etc/systemd/system/overleaf.service` file in a text editor of your choice and paste the following content into it:
    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=Overleaf Community Edition

    [Service]
    User=root
    WorkingDirectory=/opt/overleaf-toolkit
    ExecStart=/opt/overleaf-toolkit/bin/up
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=10

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

    [Unit]
    Description=Overleaf Community Edition

    [Service]
    User=root
    WorkingDirectory=/opt/overleaf-toolkit
    ExecStart=/opt/overleaf-toolkit/bin/up
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=10

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```
2. Save the file and exit the text editor.
3. Reload systemd by runnning the following command:
    ```
    systemctl daemon-reload
    ```
4. Enable the `overleaf.service` to be started on reboot:
    ```
    systemctl enable overleaf.service
    ```
5. Start the Overleaf service:
    ```
    systemctl start overleaf.service
    ```
6. Check the status of the Overleaf service:
    ```
    systemctl status overleaf.service
    ```

## Installing LaTeX packages

The LaTeX packages can now be installed, using TeX Live.
1. Run the following command to launch the Texlive manager update:
    ```
    docker exec Overleaf Community Edition tlmgr update --self
    ```
2. Run the following command to launch the full `texlive` installation:
    ```
    docker exec Overleaf Community Edition tlmgr install scheme-full
    ```
    <Message type="note">
      The installation of `texlive` may take a while.

## Configuring Nginx

This tutorial uses [NGINX](https://nginx.org/en/) with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and [CertBot](https://certbot.eff.org/) as an SSL enabled reverse proxy to secure the connection between the client and our server.

1. Install Certbot on the server:
    ```
    apt install python3-certbot-nginx
    ```
2. Generate the certificate, by running the following command:
    ```
    sudo certbot --nginx certonly
    ```

    SSL certificates issued by Let's Encrypt are valid for 90 days. Certbot comes with the option to automatically renew the certificate.
3. Configure a cron job that launches Certbot daily to check the status of the certificate. Open the crontab by typing:
    ```
    crontab -e
    ```
4. Add the following line which will stop Nginx, renew the certificate and restart the web server daily at 4:30 in the morning:
    ```
    30 4 * * * /opt/letsencrypt/certbot-auto renew --pre-hook "service nginx stop" --post-hook "service nginx start"
    ```
5.  Edit the `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` file so that it looks like the example below. This allows you to configure Nginx in a way that will serve our Overleaf Community Edition site as default site:
    ```
    server {
        listen       80;
        listen       [::]:80;

        server_name  my.overleave-instance.tld;

        location / {
          return              301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
        }
    }

    server {
      listen [::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on;
      listen 443 ssl;

      server_name my.overleave-instance.tld;

      ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/my.overleave-instance.tld/fullchain.pem;
      ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/my.overleave-instance.tld/privkey.pem;
      include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
      ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;

      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;

      add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains";
      server_tokens off;

      add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN;
      add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
      client_max_body_size 50M;

      location / {
          proxy_pass http://localhost:8877;

          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
          proxy_http_version 1.1;
          proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
          proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
          proxy_read_timeout 3m;
          proxy_send_timeout 3m;

          access_log      /var/log/nginx/Overleaf Community Edition.access.log;
          error_log       /var/log/nginx/Overleaf Community Edition.error.log;
      }
    }
    ```
6. Restart Nginx with the following command:
    ```
    service nginx restart
    ```
    You can now reach your Overleaf installation at `https://<YOUR-INSTANCE-IP>/launchpad`.
    Open a web browser and navigate to this page to set up your instance's administrator credentials, log in, and you can start drafting your documents, and invite collaborators to work with you.
