Scaleway Observability allows you to monitor your applications and their infrastructure by giving you insights and context into their behavior. Observability also enables you to visualize your metrics and logs through a Grafana dashboard.

The Observability Cockpit provides you with 2 Remote Write endpoints to be able to push metrics and logs. You can push metrics with any `Prometheus Remote Write` compatible agent such as the [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/) or [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) agents.
You can push logs with any Loki compatible agent such as the [Promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/), [Fluentd](https://docs.fluentd.org/), [Fluent Bit](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/) or [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/introduction.html) agents.

In this Quickstart, we show you how to activate your Cockpit, how to retrieve your Grafana credentials, how to create a push token and how to send metrics and logs to your Cockpit.
