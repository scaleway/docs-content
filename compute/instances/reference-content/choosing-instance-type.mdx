Scaleway Instances are virtual machines in the cloud. You can create and manage Instances via our [console](https://console.scaleway.com/), [API](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/), [CLI](https://www.scaleway.com/en/cli/) or [other developer tools](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/community-tools/). When you [create an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/), you must select the **Instance type** you want to create. This page explains the different types of Instance available at Scaleway, and helps you to choose the best one for your needs.

## Why is it important to choose the right Instance type?

Different Instance types have different prices and are designed for different use cases. They also offer different levels of power and performance, based on their maximum bandwidth, CPU, RAM and storage.
